    body: "<p>For years, Floridians have had to deal with some of the highest insurance rates in the country. The main cause? The Sunshine State is a prime target for hurricanes and storm damage.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida homeowners insurance rates are increasing</a> to even higher levels this year. There are many reasons for this, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive litigation.</li>\n<li>Rising <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">reinsurance</a> costs.</li>\n<li>Inflation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nobody’s happy when prices go up. Fortunately, there are some ways to reduce your costs and lower your homeowners insurance premium in Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getawindmitigationinspection\">1. Get a wind mitigation inspection</h2>\n<p>All Florida home insurers are required to offer credits to homeowners who take measures to make their homes more wind resistant. Your wind mitigation report can make the biggest impact in what you pay for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> (aside from your home’s location, value, and age). Bonus: your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">windstorm mitigation inspection</a> will let you know what further improvements you can make to your home to both increase its disaster preparedness and decrease your insurance bill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2raiseyourdeductible\">2. Raise your deductible</h2>\n<p>Generally, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium. Florida homeowners can adjust both their <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">AOP (standard) deductible</a> and their <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> to trim their premium. Just remember: it doesn’t make sense to pay for insurance that you can’t reasonably use when you need to. Make sure you take on a deductible that won’t leave you financially overwhelmed when you need to make a major claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3optforprivateinsurancewheneverpossible\">3. Opt for private insurance whenever possible</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/faq/citizens/\">Government-run insurance programs</a> are insurance options of last resort – and they are priced accordingly. You can save considerably if you are eligible for coverage from a private home insurer. That goes for <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>, too – if you’re in Florida, you now have an affordable, private market alternative to coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program through Kin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4askaboutdiscounts\">4. Ask about discounts</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners are eligible for a fair amount of easy home insurance discounts. For example, you get a discount from Kin automatically for having an electronic policy. You can save even more when you choose to retain your benefits during a claim instead of signing them over to a contractor. Learn more about our <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">available discounts</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5fortifyyourroof\">5. Fortify your roof</h2>\n<p>If you are a current Florida homeowner, check out the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) and acclimate yourself to their <a href=\"https://fortifiedhome.org/\">FORTIFIED Home program</a>. It’s designed to exceed industry standards on various levels, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roofing.</li>\n<li>Windows and attached structures.</li>\n<li>Roof to wall to floor to foundation connections so it acts as one system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The IBHS FORTIFIED system protects homes from hail, high winds, and hurricanes.</p>\n<p>New roof installations can exceed $10,000, which is no small bill! Financial barriers tend to be the biggest constraint on getting a new roof, so it’s important to be savvy and look for whatever resources are available to get tax breaks, grants, or work with organizations offering governmental subsidies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6bestrategicifyoumove\">6. Be strategic if you move</h2>\n<p>If you are looking to move to one of <a href=\"/blog/best-places-to-live-in-florida/\">Florida’s best places to live</a>, you might consider property further from the coast – it could potentially save you thousands annually on your Florida homeowners insurance. Inland dwellings face less severe hurricane risk than those closest to the coast.</p>\n<p>The home’s build date also has a substantial impact on Florida premiums. Homes built prior to 2001 may not be constructed according to the latest Florida building codes that were designed to optimize a structure’s wind resistance. Older homes aren’t generally equipped with as much hurricane protection as newer homes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7loweryourpersonalpropertycoverage\">7. Lower your personal property coverage</h2>\n<p>While we encourage everyone to maximize their coverage so they are fully protected in the event of a loss, you may want to lower your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a> to cover just the essentials. Reducing how much personal property coverage you carry means you won’t get as much in a total loss scenario, so you need to determine what items you will absolutely have to have replaced if you experience a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>A good way to identify how much personal property insurance you actually need is to conduct a home inventory. This helps you determine the value of your stuff, then you can work backwards to determine what’s essential. For instance, you might budget for some clothing but not for every item in the closet. In the same manner, you might budget to replace a television but not the extra televisions you had in the bedrooms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8upgradetohurricaneclips\">8. Upgrade to hurricane clips</h2>\n<p>Older homes may have hurricane truss straps that are only connected with two nails rather than three. This minor difference has dramatic effects on your insurance costs because it moves the straps from being categorized as toenails to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips\">hurricane clips</a>. Having clips can save you up to 50 percent on your home insurance. That’s a lot of savings for just a few nails but it makes your home better prepared to deal with hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>And lastly, if you are new to Florida, calculate your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance cost</a> before you close so you know what to expect.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in November 2017.

We researched cities from the Panhandle to the Keys to find the best places to live in Florida based on features that are on top of most homebuyers’ minds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwepickedthebestplacestoliveinflorida\">How We Picked the Best Places to Live in Florida</h2>\n<p>We’re big fans of just about every place you can live in Florida, so picking the best wasn’t easy. Ultimately, we came up with these five categories to help us choose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost of living:</strong> A cost of living index compares one area to another based on what people typically spend on basic necessities. Our highest score went to places with an overall cost of living index between 70 and 74. Anything with an index of 115 or higher earned just one point.</li>\n<li><strong>Housing costs:</strong> We gave places more points when the median housing price is below $200,000. Lower scores went to more expensive areas, with a middle range of $300,001 - $330,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Our lifestyle score is based on the cultural, recreational, and entertainment opportunities available in each city.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime:</strong> We used data from <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com\">NeighborhoodScout</a> to assess Florida cities’ crime rates. Rates are based on incidents per 1,000 residents of the city.</li>\n<li><strong>Schools:</strong> For schools, we focused on average test scores based on data from <a href=\"https://www.publicschoolreview.com\">Public School Review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cities could earn up to 10 points in each category for a possible 50 points in total. The chart below lists the total for our top 10 best places to live and the score the cities earned in each category.</p>\n<h3 id=\"top10bestplacestoliveinflorida\">Top 10 Best Places to Live in Florida</h3>\n<p>| Header | Total | Cost of Living | Housing | Lifestyle | Crime | Schools |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jacksonville | 34 | 6 | 9 | 9 | 5 | 5 |\n| Ocala | 32 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 3 |\n| Tampa | 31 | 4 | 4 | 10 | 7 | 6 |\n| Daytona Beach | 30 | 7 | 9 | 10 | 2 | 2 |\n| Cape Coral | 30 | 4 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 7 |\n| Naples | 29 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 10 | 8 |\n| Pensacola | 29 | 7 | 8 | 7 | 5 | 2 |\n| Fort Myers | 29 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 6 | 5 |\n| Port St. Lucie | 29 | 4 | 4 | 7 | 10 | 4 |\n| Sarasota | 23 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 5 | 7 |</p>\n<h2 id=\"1jacksonville\">1. Jacksonville</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>Like many Florida cities, Jacksonville boasts beautiful beaches where residents can swim, surf and sail. But the opportunities to get outside don’t stop there. The St. Johns River also flows through the city, and the area has the largest urban park system in the country. Add to this a <a href=\"https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/economic-forecast-jacksonvilles-recovery-is-on-the-fast-track\">growing job market</a>, a median home price of <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Jacksonville_FL/overview\">$274,700</a>, and a cost of living index of 93.5, and it’s easy to see why Jacksonville is one of the best places to live in Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2ocala\">2. Ocala</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>Located in central Florida, Ocala stands out as the only city on our list that isn’t located on the ocean. The result is a different lifestyle than many of its beach town counterparts. Ocala is best known for its equestrian roots, with rolling hills and green pastures dominating the scenery.</p>\n<p>Housing costs in Ocala are reasonable. The median home sale is <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Ocala_FL/overview\">$245,000</a>, and the cost of living index is 83.8. Ocala’s historic district boasts several unique <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">types of homes</a>, including Queen Anne, Tudor, and Mediterranean styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3tampa\">3. Tampa</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>Tampa is a sports fan’s dream location. Not only do professional football, baseball, and hockey teams call the city home, but several major league baseball teams hold their spring training camps in the area. While the city is a great place for anyone who loves being on the water, it also offers a lively mix of museums, hot night spots, and family-friendly attractions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important qualities are its cost of living index,100.1, and median home cost, <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Tampa_FL/overview\">$350,000</a>. You should note, however, that the median cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa home insurance</a> is $2,107, well above the average premium in the US.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4daytonabeach\">4. Daytona Beach</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>There’s more to Daytona Beach than just the Daytona International Speedway, though that is a major attraction for car enthusiasts. Like many people living in Florida, Daytona Beach residents like being outdoors, whether that means fishing, golfing, or just enjoying the beach. However, Daytona Beach balances recreational activities with a vibrant cultural scene that offers several museums and theaters.</p>\n<p>Daytona Beach is also a very affordable city. The median home price is <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Daytona-Beach_FL/overview\">$210,500</a>, and the cost of living index is 85.7.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5capecoral\">5. Cape Coral</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>Dreaming about owning a home on the waterfront? Then Cape Coral may be the place for you. Not only is the city located on a peninsula, but Cape Coral has more than 400 miles of canals for your enjoyment ﹘ many of which take you to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Residents pay for the sights both in terms of median home prices, <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Cape-Coral_FL/overview\">$380,000</a>, and cost of living index, 103.9. Moreover, Cape Coral is growing, so you want to get established here before home prices begin to rise even more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6naples\">6. Naples</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>Fashionistas may want to take a closer look at Naples as many high-end retailers have stores in the area. But if browsing boutiques is not your thing, you might still consider Naples for its fine restaurants, amazing beachfront, or world-class golf.</p>\n<p>Living in Naples doesn’t come cheap. As of January 2022, the typical home value in the city is $560,00, and the cost of living is 111.9. That said, Naples is considered safer than <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/naples/crime\">39 percent</a> of all US cities, with a crime rate of 15.54 per 1,000 residents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7pensacola\">7. Pensacola</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>Located in the Florida Panhandle. Pensacola is known for its emerald green water and white sand beaches. The local architecture and cultural activities highlight the city's Spanish and Native American influences, and as do many of the city’s festivals. Plus, Pensacola is home to the National Naval Aviation Museum and the renowned Blue Angels. All of this also comes with a relatively low cost of living index of 87.3 and median home costs of <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Pensacola_FL/overview\">$249,800</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8fortmyers\">8. Fort Myers</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>Fort Myers is one of the top retirement communities in America, and much of the city's lifestyle reflects an older demographic. However, there are plenty of recreational opportunities for residents of all ages, including fishing, kayaking, hiking, and biking. Moreover, Fort Myers is a fairly affordable city, with a cost of living index of 96.2 and typical home costs of <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Fort-Myers_FL/overview\">$313,800</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9portstlucie\">9. Port St. Lucie</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>If chill is your thing but you still want to be close to the bustle of a big city, then you may find that Port St. Lucie is the best place to live. It’s halfway between Miami or Orlando where you can enjoy bars and restaurants by night and amusement parks by day. And you’ll still find people around Port St. Lucie paddleboarding along scenic waterways or playing a few rounds of golf.</p>\n<p>Port St. Lucie’s premium location does mean you’ll pay a bit more to live there. Typical home values are around <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/port-saint-lucie-fl/home-values\">$351,800</a> and the cost of living index is 100.7.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10sarasota\">10. Sarasota</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 23/50</strong></p>\n<p>The Sarasota-Bradenton metro area may have a population of 750,000, but Sarasota itself counts just over 54,000 residents. As a result, Sarasota feels like a small town with some big-city amenities, including several performing arts venues. The city is also home to several well-known art festivals, ranging from street painting to improv.</p>\n<p>The median price for Sarasota homes is high, <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Sarasota_FL/overview\">$464,500</a>, and the cost of living index, 102.7, is slightly higher than several of the other Florida cities on our list. But the combination of outdoor activities, art, and culture make Sarasota a town worth considering for your forever home.</p>\n<p>If Florida isn’t your cup of tea, then check out our article on the <a href=\"/blog/best-places-to-live/\">best places to live in the US</a>!</p>"

We gave cities with lower median housing costs higher scores.</li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle.</strong> Cities were given a score based on recreation options available in the area, including outdoor activities, arts, and sports.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime rate.</strong> We used crime rates from <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com\">NeighborhoodScout</a> to evaluate safety in each city. Higher crime rates resulted in lower scores for this criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Schools</strong>. We focused on testing data from <a href=\"https://www.publicschoolreview.com\">Public School Review</a> to evaluate each city’s schools.

Austin, Texas</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 40/50</strong></p>\n<p>With a population of nearly 1 million residents, Austin is the largest city on our list of best places. It ranks high for its cost of living index (66.51), which earned the city a full 10 points in our scoring system, and for its schools. However, housing in Austin is expensive. The city’s <a href=\"https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/austin-real-estate-market\">median listing price is $579,000</a>, well above the nation’s median of $374,900.</p>\n<p>That said, Austins’s hot summers and mild winters gives residents plenty of opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and the many cultural activities Austin has to offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2boiseidaho\">2. Boise, Idaho</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 40/50</strong></p>\n<p>Idaho has been booming for a while now, and Boise is a prime example of how popular the Gem State has become. The city’s population grew by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ingowinzer/2021/12/02/boise-is-boomingreal-estate-investors-should-take-note/?sh=692b0e533b66\">8 percent</a> over the last three years, brought on in part by people looking to enjoy the area’s affordability and access to fantastic hiking and biking trails. Moreover, Boise boasts a vibrant cultural scene that includes several museums and a thriving performing arts community.</p>\n<p>However, boomtowns come with boomtown prices, particularly when you look at housing costs. The median listing price reached <a href=\"https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/boise-real-estate\">$510,000 in December 2021</a>, but you may be able to balance that out through an overall low cost of living index (68.30).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3tampaflorida\">3. Tampa, Florida</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 38/50</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, Tampa benefits from Florida’s beautiful weather and world-class beaches. Locals take advantage of both, whether that means boating, fishing, or golf. But Tampa is also home to a variety of performing arts venues, popular nightlife districts, and sports teams.</p>\n<p>At 75.46, the cost of living index is higher than the first two cities on our list, but the median housing cost is just $351,400. That combined with no state income tax, could make Tampa a budget friendly option. The only dealbreaker might be the cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa home insurance</a>, but we may be able to help you with that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4tempearizona\">4. Tempe, Arizona</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 35/50</strong></p>\n<p>Tempe is where a college town meets industry. Many major corporations call the city home and recruit from Arizona State University. The result is that Tempe’s anticipated job growth for the next 10 years <a href=\"https://www.bestplaces.net/economy/city/arizona/tempe\">outstrips the rest of the US</a>. The university also attracts artists and performers of all stripes, plus the area is known for exceptional hiking and golf.</p>\n<p>The flip side of that positive job growth and abundance of activities may be the cost of living. Tempe’s cost of living index is 112.6 and <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Tempe_AZ/overview\">median home price is $475,000</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5bouldercolorado\">5. Boulder, Colorado</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>Boulder, another college town, is an outdoor lovers’ haven. Residents are just minutes away from hiking, rock climbing, and world-class skiing, plus the area’s temperate climate and 300 days of sunshine means they can enjoy the outdoors more often than not. Another benefit? The area’s growth hasn’t diminished its small-town feel where people love being part of the community.</p>\n<p>Expenses, however, are high in Boulder. As of December 2021, the median house listing price was $899,000 with a cost of living index of 167.4. But that may be the tradeoff for a top-notch education Boulder schools’ test scores are in the top 90 percent in the nation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6alexandriavirginia\">6. Alexandria, Virginia</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest draw for Alexandria has to be its proximity to historical landmarks and cultural events. But locals also know the city offers approximately 950 acres of parks, a delightful array of restaurants, and a diverse population. Alexandria also claims the <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/va/alexandria/crime\">lowest crime rate</a> out of all the cities on our list of best places to live.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, living in Alexandria isn’t cheap. In May 2021, the average home price <a href=\"https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/home-and-garden/average-home-price-above-700k-alexandria-va-may-2021\">skyrocketed to $710,000</a>. That settled down to a median of $550,000 in December, but the cost of living index sits at 112.6.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7batonrougelouisiana\">7. Baton Rouge, Louisiana</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>College sports may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Baton Rouge, but the city is also proud of its extensive park system, expanding visual arts scene, and variety of architectural points of interest. Plus, Baton Rouge is probably one of the most cost-effective cities in the country. The median home price in the city is <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Baton-Rouge_LA/overview\">$244,900</a> – $130,000 below the national median – and the cost of living index is 91.7.</p>\n<p>Baton Rouge also offers much of the good food and music found in nearby New Orleans. But this location means the city also sees more than its share of hurricanes, and that typically translates into higher-than-average <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8saltlakecityutah\">8. Salt Lake City, Utah</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>Salt Lake City mixes amazing scenery with affordable homes and a growing tech industry. The city’s median home price is $499,900. That’s higher than the national median, but when you add in the reasonable cost of living (64.96), Salt Lake City becomes a viable option for many homeowners, including single professionals and young families.</p>\n<p>Although skiing and snowboarding will always have their place, Salt Lake’s cultural scene is much more than winter sports. Residents can also enjoy professional and amateur theater, several museums, and a host of festivals celebrating the area’s diversity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9desmoinesiowa\">9. Des Moines, Iowa</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>With over 215,000 people, Des Moines is a good-sized city with a diverse population that somehow manages to maintain a sense of community. At least some of that’s due to the city’s cultural events and festivals. Even better? Des Moines may be the most affordable city on our list of best places to live. The <a href=\"https://www.dsmpartnership.com/living-here/relocate-here/cost-of-living-calculator\">median home price of $173,000</a> is among the most reasonable in the country, and the cost of living index sits at 96.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10pasadenacalifornia\">10. Pasadena, California</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>Pasadena is more than just a college football mecca. Art festivals frequent its parks, and locals are close to great hiking and skiing. However, Pasadena received low scores for its high cost of living (188.6) and <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/city/14498/CA/Pasadena/housing-market\">median home price of over $1 million</a>. But this may be the right location for people willing to pay to be near a major US city or for top-rated schools.</p>"

    body: "<p>At this point in the year, you’ve probably already formed your own opinions about the worst home decor trends of 2019. But some of these are so dangerous, they’re worth talking about in July.</p>\n<p>The point of decor is to make a home more inviting and comfortable for you and your family. But these 10 trends show what happens when aesthetics prevail over function – and safety. While your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> may have your back when it comes to a few odd accidents, but it doesn’t cover wear and tear, or features that aren’t up to code.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here are 10 decorating trends to avoid and some safer alternatives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't let aesthetics prevail over function – or safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/floating-staircase.jpg?width=1000&name=floating-staircase.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"openfeaturesaretrendingshelvingstairsandfloorplans\">Open Features Are Trending: Shelving, Stairs, and Floorplans</h2>\n<p>Open spaces are in, but that doesn’t mean they’re always safe. If you don’t love the dark or closed-off rooms, you may enjoy eliminating shadowy corners and walls that obstruct visibility. But it’s important to know the risks that come along with these features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1floatingshelvesandstorage\">1. Floating Shelves and Storage</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: “Floating” shelves, which appear to jut out dramatically from the wall, without the braces you’d see on ordinary shelves.</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: If these bookshelves and dressers are not properly anchored, they can pose a serious safety hazard. Perhaps the best example of this comes from Sweden: consider the <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/about_ikea/newsitem/112117-MALM-and-Chest-of-drawers-Recall\">infamous IKEA recall</a> after a dresser caused the death of a young boy. The new design Ikea introduced to the market requires attachment to the wall.</p>\n<p>Similarly, floating shelves must be properly anchored in order to hold the weight of any books or decorations. If you’re wondering whether yours are securely attached to your wall, check out this primer on <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Hang-Floating-Shelves\">how to install floating shelves</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: If you choose “floating” fixtures, pay attention to anchoring instructions. Failing to do so could lead to injury of your family or your guests. The latter might be covered by your homeowners insurance; the former would not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2openstaircases\">2. Open Staircases</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Staircases without banisters</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: One of the most dangerous features of a house can be a staircase, if it’s not up to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Guide-to-Handrail-and-Guard-Rail-Building-Codes-and-Standards-1.pdf\">code</a> (your handrail and guardrail must meet height and spacing requirements). While a staircase without a railing may look like an optical illusion, the risks are obvious. Your liability as a homeowner may be greatly increased by this stylistic choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Make sure your stairs and railings – interior and exterior – are <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/stairways.htm\">up to code</a> so that you can be properly covered by your homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies explicitly require homeowners to <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">maintain a certain level of care</a> of their properties – if you fail to meet this expectation, you could be in breach of your homeowners insurance contract, meaning your insurer is not obligated to cover you.</p>\n<p>In the event that the code has changed since your home was built and you find yourself faced with a repair / replacement, you will mostly likely have to rebuild / repair to meet the current code. This is highly dependent on the code and issue at hand – your insurance agent will be able to help you determine the best course of action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3openfloorplans\">3. Open Floor Plans</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Open-concept floor plans have been popularized by home improvement and renovation shows over the past decade. Stylists laud open floor plans: this design makes spaces seem bigger and allows families to share more moments together when they’re all on the same floor.</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: There are two important things to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open floor plans may increase your <a href=\"https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/2-wants-to-know/firefighters-warn-popular-home-trends-can-lead-to-dangerous-fires/83-556378669\">fire risk</a>. If there’s no wall between the kitchen and the living room, a small fire can quickly become a much larger blaze. If your rooms are separated by doors, on the other hand, you can help contain or slow the spread of a fire.</li>\n<li>Open concept floor plans can heighten your security needs. If someone can look into a window on the first floor of your house and see the entire space at a glance, they’re more easily able to case the room. In short, open floor plans can be problematic for security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Because structural features can be expensive to change, you may want to consider protecting the asset you have today rather than remodeling. Consider installing a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centrally monitored security system</a> – as an added bonus, this may help lower your homeowners insurance premium.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Make sure your stairs and railings – interior and exterior – are up to code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/decor-trends2.jpg?width=961&name=decor-trends2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"oldisnewagain\">Old Is New Again</h2>\n<p>This decorating trend may be hard to avoid. Vintage or antique items have long been popular items to personalize a home. Whether you have an old writing desk from your grandmother or you found a vintage farmhouse table at a garage sale last week, consider these three risks when you bring vintage pieces into your home:</p>\n<h3 id=\"4vintagelightfixtures\">4. Vintage Light Fixtures</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Old lamps and chandeliers classing up a space</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: Most <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/home-decor-mistakes-that-could-kill-you.html/\">vintage lighting has old wiring</a>, and that may be a problem. Address this before you plug a vintage lamp or sconce into your walls to make sure the lamp is in working condition inside and out.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: If you fall in love with a vintage piece and you’re not an electrician, invest in having it updated – or look for a contemporary lookalike. Having the perfect light is just not worth the risk of fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5antiqueappliances\">5. Antique Appliances</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Retro-chic major appliances</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: That beautiful old stove you bought? It may be covered in lead paint or contain corroded parts that, while functional, may be hazardous to your health. Whenever you acquire an antique appliance, take the time to have it checked out by a professional – likely a licensed electrician.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Once you’ve verified that your vintage piece is safe, check to see what it’s worth. In the event that your it’s highly valuable, be sure to add it your inventory of scheduled personal property. Just give your homeowners insurance agent a call.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6exposedplumbing\">6. Exposed Plumbing</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Pipes that aren’t hidden behind the wall</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: Clean copper pipes may look great, but they can be hot to the touch. Exposed plumbing is especially popular in bathrooms these days, and if you choose to jump on this trend, be sure your pipes are safely positioned to be out of reach of children (and generally not somewhere you’re likely to brush against by accident all the time). In some cases, they might also cause fires.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: This is one of the top home decor trends of 2019, but it must be executed with caution. Make sure exposed pipes are out of the way, and make sure any nearby materials are durable and fire resistant at a minimum.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Having the perfect light is just not worth the risk of fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/decor-trends3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"woodaccentsaremakingacomeback\">Wood Accents Are Making a Comeback</h2>\n<p>Sleek plastic cabinetry and Scandinavian modernism’s chrome accents are out. Wood accents are in, but they come with additional risks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7wicker\">7. Wicker</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: If you believe the style guides, <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/interior-designers/a24844028/home-trends-for-2019/\">wicker furniture and baubles</a> are marking a comeback.</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: These nods to the natural may look great in your front hall, but they are entirely composed of highly flammable material. Remember: wicker burns quicker.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Keep your light, reedy objects away from the stove and far from the fireplace to stay safe. If you don’t want to avoid this home decorating trend, you can at least avoid placing your wicker homegoods near open flames.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8salvagedwood\">8. Salvaged Wood</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: “Salvaged” wood (i.e., old wood)</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: Old wood pieces are typically very dry. They may also be covered in chipping paint or, worse, lead paint. <strong>Bottom line</strong>: Do a thorough inspection before bringing these items into your living space.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Remember: wicker burns quicker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/decor-trends4.jpg?width=938&name=decor-trends4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"lifestyletrendsendure\">Lifestyle Trends Endure</h2>\n<h3 id=\"9hammocks\">9. Hammocks</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: Hammocks and slacklines, the taut ropes people walk on</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: In recent years, many college campuses have banned hammocks and slacklines for posing too high a public safety risk. And these new rules aren’t just limited to campuses; <a href=\"https://www.grandtrunk.com/blogs/news/cities-banning-hammocking\">several cities have also banned hammocks</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a hammock enthusiast at home, consider these two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your hammock is indoors, it should be properly anchored in the wall or in a structural post. Your hammock should be low to the ground and far from any hazards like stairwells or railings.</li>\n<li>If you restrict your hammock use to the yard, consider the risks and make sure your hammock is properly installed, whether it’s freestanding or anchored.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: If you’re concerned about your personal liability, you may want to rely on more stable seating options that rest on the ground.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10tvoverthefireplace\">10. TV Over the Fireplace</h3>\n<p><strong>The trend</strong>: TVs mounted above the mantel</p>\n<p><strong>The risk</strong>: Heat and soot can make for a dangerous situation <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/please-dont-mount-your-tv-over-the-fireplace/\">if your television is hung over the fireplace</a>.</p>\n<p>There are actually several practical reasons not to put your television there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proximity to heat may void the <a href=\"/blog/what-is-home-warranty-insurance/\">warranty</a> on your flatscreen. Be sure to read the fine print.</li>\n<li>Neck strain is a real issue. If you mount your television too high, you may find that watching the tube leads to long-term chiropractic problems.</li>\n<li>Whether you have a lower-heat gas stove or wood-burning open fire, it’s a gamble to place your television over an open hearth. The weight of the television on the shortened wall may be risky, even if you choose to place your television directly on the mantle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: This is one of the worst home decor trends of 2019 because it’s high risk and low reward. If you’re undeterred and looking for information about how to safely mount your TV above a fireplace, check out these <a href=\"https://www.bobvila.com/articles/mount-tv-above-a-fireplace/\">tips from Bob Vila</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenitcomestohomesafetytrustyourgut\">When It Comes to Home Safety, Trust Your Gut</h2>\n<p>Your home should be the place where you feel safest. Taking a few steps to make sure your pursuit of a home decorating trend doesn’t run counter to this mission is worth your time. If you don’t feel confident that you’ve got your bases covered, you can always do a <a href=\"/blog/diy-home-inspection/\">DIY home inspection</a> or run through our <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-safety-checklist/\">home safety checklist</a> to make sure everything’s in order.</p>"

    body: "<p>One of the joys of owning a home is the freedom to make it fit your style. But some home renovation projects can be time-consuming and expensive if you <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hire contractors</a> to do the job.</p>\n<p>So why not see what you can tackle yourself? Not only can small projects improve the look and feel of your home, but they can also add to the home’s value. The key is to pick projects that are both safe and can be done appropriately by a careful amateur.</p>\n<p>These 10 DIY home projects may be a good fit for your skill set and budget. For easy reference, the projects are organized by objective (from installing new fixtures to upgrading decor).</p>\n<h2 id=\"projectinstallnewfixtures\">Project: Install new fixtures</h2>\n<h3 id=\"faucets\">Faucets</h3>\n<p>Replacing faucets can add a quick touch of your style to your home’s kitchen and bathrooms. The only tools you’ll need are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two adjustable wrenches</li>\n<li>A basin wrench</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose from a <a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/remodel/bathroom-remodel/how-to-pick-bathroom-faucets\">variety of faucets</a>, but you may want to make sure the finish (e.g., polished chrome, bronze, etc.) match or purposefully contrast your existing fixtures.</p>\n<p>Remember that apart from design, faucets come in different configurations (e.g. hole openings). These can range from the standard single-hole faucets to pull-outs and side sprayers. When choosing your new fixture, pick one that matches the hole openings to your sink.</p>\n<p>Ready to start? See <a href=\"https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/remodeling/budget-remodels/weekend-home-projects/?slideId=2d5c9cfe-ea34-46a9-9d68-bd8de450151d\">how to change a faucet</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightingfixtures\">Lighting fixtures</h3>\n<p>Switching out lighting fixtures is another way to update your home’s look. This project only requires a few basic tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wire cutters</li>\n<li>Screwdriver</li>\n<li>Wire connectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.lumens.com/how-tos-and-advice/how-to-choose-the-right-size-ceiling-light.html\">picking out your new fixture</a>, consider the placement (e.g. over the dining room table or kitchen island), fixture diameter, and clearance (you don’t want anyone to hit their head).</p>\n<p>Before starting any lighting projects, make sure to turn off your power at the breaker boxes. For step-by-step instructions on replacing a light fixture, see this <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/projects/build-and-remodel/change-a-light-fixture/project\">easy guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ceilingfans\">Ceiling fans</h3>\n<p>Living in the south means hot and humid summers. Luckily, ceiling fans can cool the air while saving on air conditioner costs.</p>\n<p>The ceiling fan installation process is similar to that of lighting fixtures. You’ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wire cutters</li>\n<li>Screwdriver</li>\n<li>Wire connectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the wall is less than 12 feet long, homeowners generally choose a 36-inch diameter fan.</p>\n<p>Depending on the current fixture type, you may need to install a support brace for your ceiling fan. If you can get to the space above the ceiling, you can also make a brace using some wood and screws. If you don’t, you can insert an expanding metal brace through the fixture hole from below.</p>\n<p>This guide offers the remaining <a href=\"https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/electrical-and-wiring/how-to-replace-a-light-fixture-with-a-ceiling-fan\">fan installation steps</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"projectupgradeyourhomesexterior\">Project: Upgrade your home’s exterior</h2>\n<h3 id=\"painting\">Painting</h3>\n<p>Nothing helps your home stand out like a great exterior color scheme. That doesn’t have to mean redoing your siding, which can get pretty expensive.</p>\n<p>Instead, paint portions of your home’s exterior in a color that fits its existing palette. This will refresh your home’s appearance without breaking the bank or overextending yourself. Parts to consider painting include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Door casings</li>\n<li>Front door</li>\n<li>Railings</li>\n<li>Roof edgings</li>\n<li>Window frames</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/exteriors/curb-appeal/tips-for-exterior-trim-colors/\">These tips</a> can help you pick out exterior accent colors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"projectgetorganized\">Project: Get organized</h2>\n<h3 id=\"drawerchargingstations\">Drawer charging stations</h3>\n<p>We’re always scrambling around for phone and laptop chargers, not mention untangling them from the bottom of our bags of drawers.</p>\n<p>Yet by <a href=\"https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/remodeling/budget-remodels/weekend-home-projects/?slideId=b9964d8b-9dc2-488b-9008-5c6690ff3f4e\">installing a power strip</a> in the back of your kitchen and/or bathroom drawers, you can easily store and charge all your electronic devices in one location – no more messy drawers and countertops.</p>\n<p>In most cases, all you’ll need to do is drill holes in the back of your drawers for the power strip cord. You can also outfit your drawers with organizers to give each device an assigned place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"medicinecabinets\">Medicine cabinets</h3>\n<p>Medicine cabinets are great for bathroom storage. Yet depending on the number of bathrooms (and people) in your home, one cabinet per room may not be enough.</p>\n<p>With a stud finder and drill, you can install a medicine cabinet (or two) for your bathrooms. This project can usually be completed in less than an hour! You’ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bolts</li>\n<li>Drywall anchors</li>\n<li>A stud finder</li>\n<li>Drill</li>\n<li>A pencil to mark the cabinet’s placement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose a cabinet that mounts directly to the wall. This way, you won’t have to worry about cutting out drywall to make room for your cabinet. Then check out these <a href=\"https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/rooms-and-spaces/bathroom/how-to-install-a-basic-medicine-cabinet\">installation instructions</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"projectupgradeyourdecor\">Project: Upgrade your decor</h2>\n<h3 id=\"crownmolding\">Crown molding</h3>\n<p>Who says you have to stick to single-color walls for your rooms? Crown molding can add a stylistic touch to any room and can be used to create atmospheric effect. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Style molding can help low-ceiling rooms look more spacious.</li>\n<li>Greek Revival molding can add some visual interest to a room with minimal decor.</li>\n<li>Early American molding can help your ceiling blend with new room additions, making them appear cohesive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installing crown molding is also straightforward. You’ll need a saw, tape measure, and nails. Make sure someone else is around to spot the ladder while you work. For more instructions, see this <a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/how-to-install-crown-molding\">crown molding installation guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"staircaseembellishments\">Staircase embellishments</h3>\n<p>Similar to crown molding, staircase embellishments can enhance your staircase. You may want to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tile</strong>. You can use tile in a variety of colors and create an eye-catching pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Wallpaper</strong>. Try matching your stairs with the room’s wallpaper.</li>\n<li><strong>Acrylic</strong>. You can use clear acrylic to protect decorative staircase panels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before moving forward with the installation, carefully inspect your stairs. Remove nails, staples, or tacks. Fill any hole or cracks with putty.</p>\n<p>For steps on installing tile on your stairs, <a href=\"http://homeguides.sfgate.com/install-tile-wooden-stairs-25485.html\">check out this guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kitchenbacksplash\">Kitchen backsplash</h3>\n<p>Backsplashes are both stylish and functional and can easily update the look of your kitchen. You may consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acrylic tiles</strong> to add a beautiful accent to a solid-color kitchen.</li>\n<li><strong>Mirrored tiles</strong> to make a small kitchen seem larger.</li>\n<li><strong>Reclaimed wood</strong> to contrast kitchens with stainless steel elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are <a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/design/rooms/kitchens/30-splashy-kitchen-backsplashes-pictures\">some examples</a>.</p>\n<p>Most backsplash installations only require tile adhesives, grout, measuring tools, and a tile-cutter. See these <a href=\"https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/masonry-and-tiling/install-a-tile-backsplash\">backsplash installation instructions</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacecabinetdoorinserts\">Replace cabinet door inserts</h3>\n<p>Similar to a backsplash installation, changing your cabinet door inserts can revamp your kitchen. Try swapping out your current inserts with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glass</li>\n<li>Stainless steel</li>\n<li>Stamped tin</li>\n<li>Wood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from the chosen inserts, you’ll need a screw gun and caulking gun. If you cut out the inserts yourself, you’ll also need a table saw. Use <a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/ideas-for-the-kitchen-cabinet-door-inserts/\">these steps</a> as a guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeyourhomereflectyou\">Make your home reflect you</h2>\n<p>DIY projects help you quickly and inexpensively spruce up your home. These improvements can add curb appeal and atmospheric effect to your home – and add to its value.</p>\n<p>But remember to only take on projects that you feel comfortable completing on your own. When in doubt, ask for help from a professional. And if a project requires you to use a ladder, make sure a spotter is present to assist you. Improving your home is only worthwhile if you get to enjoy the fruits of your labor, so stay safe!</p>"

    body: "<p>Whether you’re trying to attract buyers or make your home more inviting to guests, you want your home to be beautiful inside and out. These simple curb appeal ideas can spruce up your home’s exterior in a way that prospective buyers and guests will love.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1chooseuniquelandscaping\">1. Choose Unique Landscaping</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-landscaping.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of colorful flower garden in front of a white house\" title=\"Landscaping improves your curb appeal by framing your house.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Landscaping acts as a frame for your home, so keep it interesting.</small></i></p>\n<p>When it comes to curb appeal, landscaping is of the utmost importance. Your yard frames your entire house, so you want to make sure your lawn, trees, and other greenery are healthy and neat.</p>\n<p>“You want your property to appear well put together, and having interesting trees and plants can make it seem like a unique find altogether,” says Jeremy Yamaguchi of <a href=\"https://www.lawnlove.com\">Lawn Love</a>. “Trees or plants with unique colors, shapes, or that are simply different from what the surrounding yards have will all work.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"2addpottedplantstoyourentrance\">2. Add Potted Plants to Your Entrance</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-potted-plants.jpg\" alt=\"A cement planter holding purple, yellow, and red flowers on the front porch of a white home\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Potted plants are an inexpensive option for creating curb appeal.</small></i></p>\n<p>Similar to landscaping, potted plants near your door can brighten up what might otherwise be a dull space. Andra DelMonico of <a href=\"https://trendey.com\">Trendey</a> says this easy curb appeal idea is easy and “breathes life and color into your entry” while also making our home look well cared for.</p>\n<p>“Choose plants that are full and thriving for the biggest immediate impact,” DelMonico recommends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keepyourhedgesneatlytrimmed\">3. Keep Your Hedges Neatly Trimmed</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-hedges.jpg\" alt=\"A row of neatly trimmed bushes along the side of a home\" title=\"Give your hedges sharp edges to keep them looking neat.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Regular maintenane keeps your hedges looking sharp.</small></i></p>\n<p>Taking care of your hedges and bushes is essential to making your home attractive, according to Omer Reiner, a licensed realtor with <a href=\"https://www.floridacashhomebuyers.com/jacksonville\">Florida Cash Home Buyers</a>. He explains that sharp edges make bushes appear neatly trimmed longer.</p>\n<p>“Trim-looking bushes increase curb appeal and home value quite significantly,” says Reiner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4paintthefrontdoor\">4. Paint the Front Door</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-door.jpg\" alt=\"A white home with a bright teal door\" title=\"Bold colors on your front door create a focal point.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>A brightly colored front door gives your home a focal point.</small></i></p>\n<p>Andre Kazimierski of <a href=\"https://www.improovy.com/phoenix-painters\">Improovy Painters</a> says using an accent color is a good way to freshen up your entrance while also boosting your curb appeal. He suggests painting your front door a bold color to “give your home a focal point that is so important for first impressions.”</p>\n<p>Remember, however, that you want to coordinate your accent color with the other colors already on your house. Make your siding and trim similar in color so your front door really pops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5addwindowboxes\">5. Add Window Boxes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-window-box.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Window boxes with beautiful flowers can add to the perceived value of your home.</small></i></p>\n<p>Miami realtor Trey Van Tuyl of <a href=\"https://www.discoverhomesmiami.com\">DiscoverHomesMiami.com</a> thinks window boxes are a great idea for increasing curb appeal. “This might seem a bit old-fashioned,“ he says, “but buyers love to see attractive window boxes full of colorful flowers.They go a long way to adding perceived value to your home.”</p>\n<p>Window boxes are <a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/windows/21016687/how-to-hang-a-window-box\">easy to install</a> and are a relatively inexpensive way to add color to your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6displaynewhousenumbers\">6. Display New House Numbers</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-numbers.jpg\" alt=\"The number 30 on the white column of a house\" title=\"Adding decorative house numbers is easy and inexpensive.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Easy-to-read house numbers make your home more inviting.</small></i></p>\n<p>Have you ever struggled to find an address only to realize that the homeowners don’t have their address on display? Or they used the stick-on variety that often fails to stick? Either way, the result is less than inviting, so Leonard Ang of <a href=\"https://ipropertymanagement.com\">iPropertyManagement</a> recommends installing new house numbers that are visible from the street on the mailbox and near the garage.</p>\n<p>\"These two things are relatively cheap projects, costing less than $200. However, the curb appeal is priceless,” says Ang.</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to match the numbers to the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">style of your house</a> and to the finish of your outside light fixtures.This helps create cohesion in your home’s appearance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8addhardscaping\">8. Add Hardscaping</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-hardscape.jpg\" alt=\"A two-tiered retaining wall made of stone next to an asphalt driveway\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Hardscaping can be functional and attractive.</small></i></p>\n<p>You can use hardscaping﹘essentially, any part of your landscaping that isn’t living﹘to increase your overall overall curb appeal, according to Thomas Jepsen of <a href=\"https://www.passionplans.com\">Passion Plans</a>. He suggests “breaking the home's traditional curves” using “natural elements, such as rock.” Combining that with plants like hanging wisteria creates “a fairytale curb appeal” and “a welcoming outdoor space.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"7illuminateyourhomesexterior\">7. Illuminate Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-lighted-entry.jpg\" alt=\"A brightly lit front porch\" title=\"Lighting your home increases both curb appeal and safety.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Lighting your entry helps with curb appeal and safety.</small></i></p>\n<p>Lighting up your home definitely increases its appeal, but that’s only one benefit, according to Dan Belcher of Mortgage Relief. He claims the added light increases safety, especially if you rely on new technologies to turn them on and off. “Smart home features are great for additional security since installation can be upgradeable with an enabled camera or fingerprint scan﹘something many homeowners want today.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9drawattentiontoyourwindows\">9. Draw Attention to Your Windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-shutters.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of white shutters and window box with flowers on a bright blue house\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>You can transform your home's exterior with colorful shutters.</small></i></p>\n<p>Shutters add visual interest that can boost curb appeal, plus painting them is another way to add a pop of color to your exterior. But if shutters don’t appeal to you, then you may want to pay attention to your window treatments.</p>\n<p>Granted, most people think of window treatments as part of their <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design</a>, but Rachel Fernie of <a href=\"https://www.hunterdouglas.com\">Hunter Douglas</a> says you can “bright blinds or curtains to add character” that can transform how your windows appear from the outside. Alternatively, Fernie suggests displaying a piece of statement art in the window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10updateyourmailbox\">10. Update Your Mailbox</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curb-appeal-ideas-mailbox.jpg\" alt=\"A black mailbox with a gold flag in the front yard of a Florida home\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Increase your curb appeal by swapping out your old mailbox for something more on trend.</small></i></p>\n<p>Nothing sours the appearance of your manicured law like a dilapidated mailbox, so Dino DeNenna from <a href=\"https://www.hiltonheadrealtysales.com\">Hilton Head Realty</a> recommends changing your old one for something new and trendy.</p>\n<p>“A new mailbox installation can cost you around $50-$200, depending on the type of mailbox you need, says DeNenna, and adds that “a warm-colored and posh-looking mailbox increases the home’s curb appeal.”</p>"

    body: "<p>Many parts of the country have already seen their first snowfall of the year, but that doesn’t mean it’s too late to winterize your home. You can still prep your home for cold weather, both inside and out, to reduce your chances of hefty repair bills or <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">insurance claims</a>.</p>\n<p>Get started with these 10 easy ways to winterize your home to keep you cozy until spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1cleanyourgutters\">1. Clean your gutters</h2>\n<p>Winter snow and rain can overwhelm your gutters, especially if they're full of leaves and debris. Cleaning your gutters helps ensure that water from rain and melting snow or ice flows away from your house. While you’re at it, make sure your downspout also pushes water far from your foundation to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">reduce your risk of water damage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2reverseyourceilingfan\">2. Reverse your ceiling fan</h2>\n<p>You may not think about ceiling fans as part of your <a href=\"/blog/prep-your-home-for-winter/\">winter preparations</a>, but they can help with heating. Just reverse your fan so that it rotates clockwise and pushes warm air down. You can usually do this on a pull chain fan by pushing the reversal switch found on the body of the fan. Some fans have reversal switches on their remotes or wall switches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3installnewweatherstripping\">3. Install new weatherstripping</h2>\n<p>Drafts can do a number on your heating bill. But weatherstripping on doors and windows can only eliminate drafts if it hasn’t worn down or fallen off. Take a look at your weatherstripping and replace it if you see missing chunks or light shining through when the door or window is closed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4installelectricaloutletgaskets\">4. Install electrical outlet gaskets</h2>\n<p>Another way to stop cold air from coming into your home (and your hard-earned dollars from going out) is to buy foam rubber outlet gaskets. Outlets typically sit in junction boxes that have holes for wires, and that allows a surprising amount of cold air to sneak in. Prevent air leaks by removing the cover plate, pressing the gasket in place, and replacing the plate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5winterizehomeplumbing\">5. Winterize home plumbing</h2>\n<p>Pipes can freeze during winter months –&nbsp;yes, even if you live in the South. Just look at Texas in February 2021 – a cold snap caused <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/18/texas-winter-weather-frozen-pipes-burst-food-damage-expected/4489631001/\">frozen pipes to burst</a> throughout the state. Surprisingly, homes in warmer climates may have even more risk because builders are less likely to properly insulate pipes.</p>\n<p>Long story short, every homeowner should take steps to winterize their home plumbing. This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insulating pipes.</strong> Cover pipes in exterior walls or uninsulated attics and basements with foam rubber or fiberglass sleeves. These are available at most hardware stores.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave taps on.</strong> If you face a particularly harsh cold snap, you may be able to prevent frozen pipes by leaving faucets on just enough to let out a trickle of water.</li>\n<li><strong>Disconnect and drain outdoor hoses.</strong> Leaving exterior hoses connected may allow ice to build up, which can lead to interior plumbing problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Cover outdoor faucets.</strong> Winter covers for your exterior faucets are an inexpensive way to winterize your home plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you're at it, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.adbseptic.com/post/how-to-prepare-your-septic-system-for-winter\">prepare your septic tank for winter</a>, too. </p>\n<h2 id=\"6findyourshutoffvalve\">6. Find your shut-off valve</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the easiest way to winterize your home plumbing is to make sure you and everyone living with you knows how to shut off your water supply. Find both the main shut-off valve as well as the shut-off valves on your other fixtures, such as your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water heater.</li>\n<li>Dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Sinks.</li>\n<li>Toilets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granted, this won’t completely save you from water damage, but it can minimize problems if a pipe bursts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7installasmartthermostat\">7. Install a smart thermostat</h2>\n<p>Installing a smart thermostat that keeps your home at the right temperature no matter what’s going on can <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce your energy consumption and your energy bill</a>. Program it to kick in when you’re about to get up in the morning so the home is warm and set it to turn temperatures down while you’re asleep or at work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getaheatingsystemtuneup\">8. Get a heating system tune-up</h2>\n<p>Every aspect of your heating system needs an annual check up performed by a professional technician. Regular maintenance can reduce heating costs, improve air quality, and prevent breakdowns. Most importantly, a professional HVAC technician can identify issues that may lead to carbon monoxide leaks, a problem that leads to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/copoisoning/index.html\">430 deaths and 50,000 emergency room visits</a> every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9changethebatteriesinsmokedetectors\">9. Change the batteries in smoke detectors</h2>\n<p>Space heaters, candles, fireplaces, and <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">holiday decorations create serious fire risk</a> during the winter months. You already test (or should test) smoke detectors once every month, so why not take the onset of the winter holidays as a cue to change the batteries?</p>\n<h2 id=\"10trimtreesandbranches\">10. Trim trees and branches</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">Trimming trees</a> reduces the chance of a branch breaking and falling on your home, car, or fence. Before the onset of serious snow, late fall or early winter in many areas of the county, is a good time to trim back branches. That’s when many trees are dormant, and trees have bare branches so pruning is easier.</p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances and your policy, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> typically covers the cost of many of the potential claims in this list. However, the last thing you want is to have a claim during the harsh winter months. Do what you can to prevent a claim from happening in the first place.</p>"

    body: "<p>Giving your home a good scrub when the weather turns warm is a time-honored ritual of homeownership, but you don’t have to do it all yourself. There are many great spring cleaning apps to help with home maintenance and chores, from outsourcing errands to unburdening yourself of your extra possessions.</p>\n<p>We reviewed dozens of the most popular service and home improvement apps out there to find our 10 favorite apps for cleaning house.</p>\n<p><strong>A quick word on apps:</strong> startups can come and go, and some take time to grow. Depending on where you live, these services may not be available to you – yet. If any of these isn’t available where you live, a quick online search will likely turn up a similar product available in your market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getallkindsofhelpfromtaskrabbit\">1. Get All Kinds of Help from TaskRabbit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taskrabbit.com/\">TaskRabbit</a> has been around since 2008, and the app is a popular way to match skilled locals, called “taskers,” with homeowners who have chores that need to get done. Think of taskers as your helping hands for the errands you just don’t have time to run and the tasks you can’t seem to make time to do.</p>\n<p>This spring cleaning app offers a wide array of services. For example, you hire a tasker to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Align your doors.</li>\n<li>Assist your mother with her yard work.</li>\n<li>Make a Home Depot run for the house cleaning items you need.</li>\n<li>Install shelves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even hire taskers to help with work far beyond your standard spring cleaning needs. If you find yourself so excited about finishing your spring cleaning that you throw a backyard barbeque to celebrate, you might hire a Tasker to help you pick up ice at the last minute.</p>\n<p>After acquiring TaskRabbit in late 2017, last March <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ikea-services-taskrabbit-focus/ikea-accelerates-services-drive-as-competition-stiffens-idUSKCN1Q00G3\">IKEA announced a service partnership with TaskRabbit</a> for furniture assembly and installation. Choosing to go with this official partner could spare you the relationship-straining challenge of interpreting pictorial furniture assembly instructions with your loved ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2hireacleaningorhomerepairspecialistonhandy\">2. Hire a Cleaning or Home Repair Specialist on Handy</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.handy.com/\">Handy</a> offers some of the same services that TaskRabbit does, its focus is more narrowly associated with the home. In fact, its bread-and-butter offerings are house cleaning and installations.</p>\n<p>Sure, there are maid services out there, but Handy isn’t quite that either. If you’re looking for help with a deep clean or finally organizing the items in your garage, Handy has that helper for hire.</p>\n<p>Handy also includes a store with a limited inventory of home appliances. Buying them includes expert installation. If the home security system or air conditioner you’re looking for happens to be in Handy’s shop, you may want to check it out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3assignandmanagechoresusingourhome\">3. Assign and Manage Chores Using OurHome</h2>\n<p>One of the most daunting tasks at any age can be managing chores, but the app <a href=\"http://ourhomeapp.com/\">OurHouse</a> is an easy way to get tasks under control. Whether you and your spouse are the only two at home, or you have four teenagers to wrangle, OurHome can help you assign tasks to your housemates. (See how nice and equal that sounds?)</p>\n<p>The OurHome website even recommends using this tool to assign tasks to visiting in-laws. While this may sound daring, it’s not a bad idea. Through the app, you can send them reminders and include detailed descriptions or shopping lists to go along with tasks.</p>\n<p>To get your kids involved, OurHouse offers a points and rewards system that incentivizes participation. This could turn spring cleaning housework into your own home Olympics!</p>\n<h2 id=\"4outsourceyourlaundrywithrinse\">4. Outsource Your Laundry with Rinse</h2>\n<p>Laundry is the chore that never ends: there’s always more to wash and dry, and never quite enough time to get it all done before leaving the house. When it’s time for spring cleaning, do yourself a favor and outsource this task, especially for heavy-duty laundry like curtains and comforters.</p>\n<p>The laundry services app <a href=\"https://www.rinse.com/\">Rinse</a> can free up your schedule and mental energy for chores that require your focus.</p>\n<p>One caveat: Rinse has a limited geographical range. As they expand, keep an eye out for their service in your area (if they haven’t reached you yet). If you can’t outsource this chore entirely, we still recommend looking for a laundromat with a drop-off service to help manage the amount of time your seasonal laundry takes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5movebigstuffwithdolly\">5. Move Big Stuff with Dolly</h2>\n<p>There’s no reason to move big items by yourself, unless you own a truck and feel passionate about self-sufficiency. For the rest of us, there’s <a href=\"https://dolly.com/\">Dolly</a>. While a few apps higher on this list offer moving and heavy lifting on their platforms, Dolly specializes in this area. The fact that everyone on the platform has an appropriate vehicle and strength means that this service is well-priced, and its customer support is great.</p>\n<p>When it’s time to dig into spring chores, Dolly can help move bins of yard waste to the stump dump or transport the empties that’ve been building up in the garage to the municipal recycling center.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6resellyourclothesonthredup\">6. Resell Your Clothes on thredUP</h2>\n<p>While donating your clothes to Goodwill or another local charity is a wonderful option, if your clothing is more gently worn, you have options. For example, if you’re interested in making a small amount of cash off your clothes, <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/\">thredUP</a> helps you advertise and coordinate the sale.</p>\n<p>Local consignment shops are also an option, of course, but their hours may be inconvenient. There’s always the risk that after you’ve schlepped your clothing down there, they won’t be interested.</p>\n<p>Getting rid of extra clothes is a great way to free up space for storage. Reselling those clothes to get cash to reinvest in your home improvement is a great way to cover the cost of your spring cleaning supplies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7findbuyersforyourgentlyuseditemsondecluttr\">7. Find Buyers for Your Gently Used Items on Decluttr</h2>\n<p>There’s a corner of the app marketplace dedicated to making it easy to donate or sell gently used items without leaving home. <a href=\"https://www.decluttr.com/\">Decluttr</a> manages most of the process for you. It offers a forum to advertise and find buyers for gently used items. Slightly easier to use than Craigslist, think of Decluttr as a kind of online pawn shop.</p>\n<p>The model is straightforward: you go onto the platform and select the type of item you’d like to sell. Then Decluttr estimates how much you can get for it. Once approved, you send in your wares and the app does the rest. Put your items out into the world and someone else brokers the sale. For a spring cleaner, this is the dream.</p>\n<p>There are a few pitfalls. You have to pay a fee – similar to the commission a consignment store charges – and you’re not able to set your own prices. But if your goal is to clean house and get rid of stuff, Decluttr can be an effective way to get rid of electronics and other items you’ve had gathering dust for months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8rehomehighendfurniturewithchairish\">8. Rehome High-End Furniture with Chairish</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chairish.com/\">Chairish</a> isn’t your mundane Craiglist ad for selling used furniture. It’s a home decorating marketplace for high-end furniture and vintage decor. If part of your spring cleaning means redecorating or getting rid of some bulky furniture items to streamline a room, Chairish is your go-to app.</p>\n<p>It works like a consignment center. You get a free membership and can list items for sale. The app charges a 30 percent commission once the item is sold. Best of all, the Chairish app will process shipping details for you since shipping large or fragile items can be tricky. However, local pickups are the easiest to arrange.</p>\n<p>The app pays you through PayPal within 48 hours of the finalized sale. Your dashboard tracks all items and where they are in the process, so you have a bird’s eye view of what’s happening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9letgoofcollegetextbookswithecampus\">9. Let Go of College Textbooks with eCampus</h2>\n<p>If you have college textbooks lying around, you can make some extra cash by selling them online. You can probably make more selling books on <a href=\"https://www.ecampus.com/\">eCampus</a> than you would reselling them back to the bookstore you bought them at.</p>\n<p>The app is simple to use. You list your books for sale and can either get an instant buyback offer or list it on consignment to sell directly to students. Consignment sales take 15 percent from the sale price but do include a shipping credit so that you can send the book to the student.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10getridofoddsandendsandeverythinginbetweenwithfacebookmarketplace\">10. Get Rid of Odds and Ends (and Everything in Between) with Facebook Marketplace</h2>\n<p>You probably are already spending time on Facebook. Now you can take advantage of the app to sell anything and everything you don’t want through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/learn-more/\">Facebook Marketplace</a>. It’s especially good for selling home goods, tools, and clothing.</p>\n<p>Marketplace is like Facebook’s very own flea market. You can create a listing in just a couple of minutes by snapping a few photos of the item for sale and then creating a listing description. Open up the sales to your friends’ list and beyond with the app. Most people stay local and get great results selling their stuff within their community. However, you can open the geography up and ship items to people outside of your community that offer to buy your stuff.</p>\n<p>Offers come through on Messenger and are tagged as Marketplace messages so that you can keep track of interested people. Arrange for payment and pickup directly in Messenger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"springcleaningtips\">Spring Cleaning Tips</h2>\n<p>Having a plan is the most important thing to keep in mind when it comes to spring cleaning. You may want to tackle things room by room or work on a specific task in the whole house like clearing out old clothes in all the closets before you move on to the next task. Ultimately, you want to see progress for your work as you move from task to task. This helps keep you motivated to get to the next item on the list.</p>\n<p>Take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/spring-cleaning-tips\">15 Spring Cleaning Tips</a> for your best practices in getting your home in order this season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appornoappdigin\">App or No App, Dig In!</h2>\n<p>Spring is here. You’ve got all the tools you need to clean your home and get it in shape for the warmest months of the year. At the end of this list, the next step is to get started, whether that’s by downloading an app or making a shopping list of <a href=\"/blog/how-toxic-is-your-home/\">eco-friendly cleaners</a>.</p>\n<p>But if you’re not sure where to start spring cleaning or you’re overwhelmed by the list of tasks that need your attention then you may want to check out our <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">comprehensive guide to home maintenance</a>.

    body: "<p>The tornadoes that recently devastated parts of the South and Midwest are a stark reminder of just how deadly and destructive these storms can be. This particular system brought <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/deadly-tornado-outbreak-numbers/story?id=81742001\">35 confirmed tornadoes across five states</a>, destroying over 1,000 homes in Kentucky alone. Worse, the death toll stands at 90 with over 100 people unaccounted for as of this writing.</p>\n<p>One reason tornadoes are so dangerous is that there’s no “tornado season.” They may be more common in the spring, but they can occur at any time of year and in places far removed from <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley</a>. Moreover, they develop quickly and behave erratically, leaving little time for people to react and take shelter.</p>\n<p>Knowing what to do before a tornado hits can save you precious time. Here are 10 tips to show you and your family how to stay safe during a tornado.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1payattentiontowarnings\">1. Pay attention to warnings</h2>\n<p>The most important tornado safety tip is to stay alert when bad weather moves through your area. That includes tuning in to weather reports, staying alert when there is a tornado watch, and immediately taking shelter when a tornado warning is in effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2movetothebasementquickly\">2. Move to the basement quickly</h2>\n<p>While no space is 100 percent safe during a tornado, rooms below ground like a basement offer you the most protection. If you don’t have a basement, your best bet is a room on the lowest floor of your home, preferably an interior one that doesn’t have windows like a bathroom, closet, or center hallway. You should also avoid sheltering where there are heavy objects like appliances on the floor above you.</p>\n<p>Getting to the lowest floor is also ideal if you’re in a high rise. However, the average lead time for a tornado warning is only about <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2021/06/16/tornado-warning-system-has-come-long-way-but-could-better/5152104001/\">nine minutes</a>, so that may not be possible. Your next option is to find the safest room in your apartment. Again, this could be a bathroom, center hallway, or interior closet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3crouchlowtotheground\">3. Crouch low to the ground</h2>\n<p>When you find a suitable spot to shelter, lay face down on the ground and cover your head with your hands to protect yourself from flying debris. You might also want to get under heavy blankets and pillows. Even winter coats can act as a cushion if anything falls on you, plus they may keep you warm once the storm is over. Avoid laying next to heavy, unsecured objects that might fall on you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getundersomethingsturdy\">4. Get under something sturdy</h2>\n<p>You need to be prepared for the building to collapse. While you don’t want to be next to heavy objects that might fall on you, being under something sturdy like a heavy table, workbench, or desk. This can create a pocket of safety for you if the entire room collapses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5monitorstormalerts\">5. Monitor storm alerts</h2>\n<p>There are several ways to get updates on whether tornadoes continue to pose a danger in your area. Your local news will post updates, as will the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via its network of radio stations. If you haven’t already, you can also sign up for community alerts on your mobile phone. Try to have one of these handy so you know when you can safely go back outside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6donotstayinamobilehome\">6. Do not stay in a mobile home</h2>\n<p>Mobile homes are particularly susceptible to damage in a tornado. Many mobile home communities have storm shelters for their residents. If yours doesn’t, or if you live on private land, then you may need to find other shelter, preferably a building with a foundation. You’ll need to act fast if a tornado is approaching, so identify nearby options now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7goinside\">7. Go inside</h2>\n<p>Being outside makes you very susceptible to being swept up by tornado winds, so you want to find a building to shelter in. If possible, choose a building that has a basement where you will be safer from collapse and debris.</p>\n<p>If there isn’t suitable shelter, or there isn’t enough time to get to it, then go to the lowest ground you can find and lay flat with your hands over your head. Do your best to move away from cars or trees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8donttrytooutdrivethetornado\">8. Don’t try to outdrive the tornado</h2>\n<p>In general, you don’t want to try to outrun a tornado, but some situations may require you to get in your car to drive to a safer location. When that happens, take the most direct route to shelter.</p>\n<p>If you’re caught in your car during a tornado, stay in it with your head below the windows and your seatbelt on. Only leave your car if you can safely get to ground that is clearly lower than your car. Once there, lay face down and cover your head.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9avoidoverpassesifpossible\">9. Avoid overpasses if possible</h2>\n<p>An overpass might look like a safe structure for sheltering, but it can actually put you in greater danger during a tornado. The shape creates a tunneling effect that can increase wind speeds, so do not shelter below overpasses or bridges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10prepareanemergencydisasterkit\">10. Prepare an emergency disaster kit</h2>\n<p>Being prepared for a tornado includes thinking about what you might need after one hits. You have to assume that it may be days before assistance arrives, so you want to <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/owlie/emergencysupplieskit\">build a disaster kit</a> that has important supplies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bottled water.</li>\n<li>Nonperishable food.</li>\n<li>A NOAA radio.</li>\n<li>Bandages, gauze, and other first aid supplies.</li>\n<li>Cell phone charger.</li>\n<li>Prescription medications.</li>\n<li>Cash.</li>\n<li>Copies of your identification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put these and other items you cannot do without in a bag and stash it in the area you’ve designated for shelter.</p>\n<p>While some weather events provide enough warning to prepare for the potential impact, tornadoes can hit within minutes. Having a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> can make the difference for your and your family.</p>"

    body: "<p>There are many <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-increase/\">factors that determine the cost of homeowners insurance</a>. Home characteristics, such as building age and materials, affect pricing. Your credit score and insurance claim history play a part. Even the neighborhood you live in could impact home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the 11 factors that influence homeowners insurance costs and some benchmarks to reference when searching for yourself.</p>\n<p>According to a study done by ValuePenguin, homeowners insurance costs $1,083 on average in the United States. We expect this number to rise, especially considering that <strong>rates have increased more than 50% since 2008.</strong> Yikes.</p>\n<p>Insurance costs vary widely from state to state, though. The cheapest states for insurance are Oregon, Idaho, and Utah, where annual costs are $574, $590, and $634, respectively. Each is more than 40% lower than the national average!</p>\n<h2 id=\"averagecostsforfloridaandtexas\">Average costs for Florida and Texas</h2>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum sit Florida and Texas.</p>\n<p>Florida has the nation’s highest home insurance costs, with average annual costs coming in at $2,055, or 90% higher than the national average. Factors affecting the costs of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> include <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductibles</a> and potential for windstorm damage.</p>\n<p>The Lone Star state isn’t much better, having the nation’s second-highest home insurance costs. Annual premiums cost $1,947 on average, or 80% higher than the national average. Similar to Florida, severe weather like hail storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">drive Texas’ high premiums</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factorsaffectinghomeinsurancecosts\">Factors affecting home insurance costs</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1weather\">1. Weather</h3>\n<p>Florida and Texas have the highest home insurance premiums due in no small part to the likelihood of catastrophic weather events. Both states are prone to hurricanes, as we saw in 2017, while Texans also face tornados and hailstorms. This vulnerability drives up premiums, before we get to factors that homeowners can control.</p>\n<p>Other location-related factors driving home insurance costs include:</p>\n<h3 id=\"2population\">2. Population</h3>\n<p>Living in a densely populated area can affect insurance premiums for two reasons. First, highly populated areas like cities <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/HMR-ZU-15.pdf\">tend to have higher construction costs</a>. Since home insurance costs (specifically, Coverage A) correlate with replacement value, higher populated areas tend to have higher costs.</p>\n<p>However, home insurance rates also correlate with area fire suppression capabilities. Densely populated areas tend to require more capability (e.g. firefighters, fire hydrants, equipment). Homes that are <a href=\"https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance/home-insurance-basics/5-factors-that-affect-rates.html\">located near permanently staffed fire stations tend to have lower rates</a>. This is more likely in densely populated areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3neighborhood\">3. Neighborhood</h3>\n<p>Insurance companies consider the neighborhood’s claims history and crime rate when determining rates. Neighborhoods with high claims filings will see higher rates (companies will consider the area a riskier place to insure). Meanwhile, insurers also assume that a neighborhood with a higher crime rate is likely to result in more instances of personal property damage. While zip code tends to be the most common way to analyze neighborhoods, companies can vary rates down to the street.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4proximitytoriskfactors\">4. Proximity to risk factors</h3>\n<p>Homes that are located near higher-risk areas (those that could lead to insurance claims) can see higher insurance costs. For example, a remote home located on the edge of the woods could be seen as having a higher risk of forest fire damage. Similarly, a home located on a large stream or river could be seen as having a higher risk of <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood</a> damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personalfactors\">Personal factors</h3>\n<p>Insurance companies will next look at the person applying for home insurance when determining costs. Just as with location, every person comes with their own financial history and personal situation that affect their risk. When applying for home insurance, companies will look at:</p>\n<h3 id=\"5credit\">5. Credit</h3>\n<p>Most states allow insurance providers to check a person’s credit history when determining their home insurance costs. Providers use credit scores to <a href=\"https://www.credit.com/loans/mortgage-questions/does-your-credit-score-affect-your-homeowners-insurance/\">calculate an insurance score</a>, which is used to predict the likelihood of a person filing a claim.</p>\n<p>The factors that determine insurance scores are similar to credit scores, such as credit history, on-time payments, outstanding debt, and number of credit accounts. A positive insurance score can help lower your monthly home insurance premiums.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6personalbelongings\">6. Personal belongings</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/home-insurance/how-much-is-homeowners-insurance.aspx\">value of your personal belongings</a> impacts home insurance costs. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal property insurance</a> protects possessions, though typically there are restrictions. The coverage limit that you choose can change your premium - if you have more valuable personal belongings, you’ll want more coverage, which means a higher premium.</p>\n<p>Higher costs can also result from homeowners electing for scheduled personal property coverage, which is used to list out high-value items (e.g. art, furs) that need to be covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homerelatedfactors\">Home-related factors</h3>\n<p>Naturally, home insurance companies will review the home being insured when determining a quote. If you’re looking to calculate a <a href=\"http://homeguides.sfgate.com/average-cost-homeowners-insurance-3020.html\">quick ballpark estimate of your homeowners insurance cost</a>, divide the value of your home by 1,000, then multiply that amount by $3.50.</p>\n<p>Of course, more than the value of your home is considered when it comes to insurance costs. Providers will also take a look at:</p>\n<h3 id=\"7homecharacteristics\">7. Home characteristics</h3>\n<p>Several characteristics of your home can affect home insurance costs, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age: Older homes that haven’t been renovated can carry higher risks due to its older infrastructure, such as older building materials, roofing, piping, and wiring. This isn’t true all the time, though; if your home was built during a time with strict building standards, your home’s age could work in your favor. Think, “they just don’t make them like they used to.”</li>\n<li>Amenities: Additional structures on your home, such as separate garages, sheds, and swimming pools, carry their own set of risk factors, which can raise overall home insurance costs.</li>\n<li>Value: The higher your structure’s value (and thus, cost to replace), the higher the insurance costs are to cover it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"8framingtype\">8. Framing type</h3>\n<p>According to a ValuePenguin study that examined framing types in California, Oregon, and Texas, brick/masonry and brick/masonry veneer framing saw a 5 to 10% decrease in home insurance costs compared to the overall average. On the other hand, homes with a log/wood framing type saw a 13% increase compared to the overall average.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insurancefactors\">Insurance factors</h3>\n<h3 id=\"9deductibles\">9. Deductibles</h3>\n<p>Monthly premiums and deductibles have an inverse relationship: the higher you’re willing to pay by the month, the lower your deductible. Some homeowners may opt for the opposite, preferring a lower monthly premium for a higher deductible.</p>\n<p>Though lower premiums will save homeowners money in the short-term, keep in mind that in the event of an accident, more money will have to be paid upfront before the insurance company will step in. A good rule of thumb is to never choose a policy that has a deductible higher than you can pay on short notice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10homesclaimshistory\">10. Home's claims history</h3>\n<p>Insurance providers will look at the home’s <em>entire</em> claims history, which includes claims filed by you and any previous owners. Home insurance costs can rise if more than one claim has been filed on a home over a 10-year period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11homeinsurancediscounts\">11. Home insurance discounts</h3>\n<p>Homeowners often times have the ability to lower their home insurance costs through <a href=\"https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance/home-insurance-basics/homeowners-insurance-discounts.html\">discounts offered by their providers</a>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundling: Some providers will give discounts if you purchase more than one type of insurance from them (e.g. auto and home insurance).</li>\n<li>Claims-Free: Home insurance providers can give discounts to homeowners who don’t file claims. In some cases, the percentage may be so great (up to 20%) that it may be worth it to homeowners to pay for expenses out-of-pocket.</li>\n<li>Loyalty: Homeowners in good standing with their provider can be awarded discounts after staying with them for a number of years.</li>\n<li>Home Improvements: Insurance companies may offer discounts for homeowners who make renovations or update older infrastructure such as piping and wiring.</li>\n<li>Payment Options: Setting up automatic payments or paying in-full can result in small discounts.</li>\n<li>Personal Factors: Some providers even reward non-smokers and retirees with discounts due to posing lower risks than others. Retirees, for instance, are home more and more likely to spot a problem before getting too serious.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When shopping for a new insurance provider, remember to ask about eligible discounts and their amount. Percentages may vary from provider to provider, which can impact overall costs.</p>\n<p>Yes, many factors go into determining home insurance costs, from personal financial history to the home’s location to the home itself. While it’s possible to get an idea of the costs for your home from current state averages, every case is different. You may be qualified for certain discounts, or find that different providers treat factors different.</p>\n<p>In other words, every homebuyer should shop around before settling on an insurance provider. Fortunately, homeowners don’t have to search for home insurance quotes alone. Independent agents can help with comparing providers and offer insights into the best option. Providers have agents and customer reps to answer questions.</p>"

    body: "<p>Congrats! You’re moving into a new home. This time is exciting…and daunting. After all, there’s a lot to do. You need to complete repairs and projects on the new home, notify utility and billing companies about your new address, hire movers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>And that’s all before move-in day!</p>\n<p>We at Kin understand this, and have put together this new home checklist to keep at your side. These are the top items every new homeowner needs to remember before, day-of, and after the big move.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1tackleyourpunchlist\">1) Tackle Your Punch List</h3>\n<p>If you’re purchasing a newly constructed home, you should ask the home’s builder/contractor for a <a href=\"https://blog.plangrid.com/2017/11/building-101-what-is-a-construction-punch-list/\">punch list</a> - the list of problems that need to be fixed by the builder. Though reputable builders will have already done this, you should never assume.</p>\n<p>Once the contractor has put together the punch list, they’ll flag the issues with red tape and have their workers address each one. Upon completion, the contractor should do another walkthrough to make sure all problems were fixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<h3 id=\"2purchasehomeinsurance\">2) Purchase Home Insurance</h3>\n<p>Though you probably had to apply for home insurance when applying for a mortgage, this step is important for all homeowners no matter their financial situation. Home insurance covers costs for a variety of events related to (or that occur on) your property.</p>\n<p>Most home insurance policies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling Insurance</a>: Coverage for damage to your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other Structures Insurance</a>: Coverage for additional structures on your home, such as a shed or detached garage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal Property Insurance</a>: Coverage for personal belongings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use Insurance</a>: Coverage for expenses incurred while you were displaced from your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability Insurance</a>: Coverage for claims made against you due to events that happened on your property (e.g. injury).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments Insurance</a>: Coverage for necessary medical expenses (i.e. smaller claims) due to an accident that happened on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners should shop around and compare providers before settling on a home insurance policy. Different providers may qualify you for different discounts (e.g. new home, bundling with other products) which may lower your premiums and deductible.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing (e.g. when getting a mortgage)</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"3getahomeinspection\">3) Get a Home Inspection</h3>\n<p>Ideally, you should have your <a href=\"http://www.hgtv.com/design/real-estate/6-things-to-know-before-buying-a-new-home\">home inspected by an independent professional</a> before purchasing. The inspector can identify minor and major issues that you could leverage to save thousands on the home’s final price. Compared to the average inspection cost of $200-300, the potential savings are a bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"4updatemailingandbillinginformation\">4) Update Mailing and Billing Information</h3>\n<p>Alright, now things are starting to sink in. Once you have a move-in date confirmed, you need to notify all major accounts of your change in address. These should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banks and credit card companies</li>\n<li>Employer</li>\n<li>Insurance companies</li>\n<li>Other accounts (e.g. student loan companies)</li>\n<li>Subscriptions (e.g. magazines, memberships)</li>\n<li>Utility companies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also <a href=\"http://www.houseandhammer.com/new-home-checklist-things-new-homeowners-should-do-right-away/\">set up mail forwarding at your post office</a> to make sure you receive all mail over the first few months after the move. Monitoring the mail that gets forwarded will help you take stock of anything that slipped through the cracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"5setupservicesatyournewhome\">5) Set Up Services At Your New Home</h3>\n<p>For your new home, you need to contact utility and service providers to set up start dates. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electric</li>\n<li>Gas</li>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Internet</li>\n<li>Cable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These dates don’t need to align with your move-in date, but instead should be coordinated with when you plan to work on the home. For example, if you plan to paint two weeks before the move-in date, you should have your electric turned on for that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"6hireamover\">6) Hire A Mover</h3>\n<p>Once you have a move-in date, you need to hire a moving company. However, not all moving companies are reputable or may be suited to your needs. To avoid things going wrong on the big move-in day, keep in mind the following tips for hiring a mover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check online sites like Angie’s List to view customer reviews and get a sense of how the mover deals with customers.</li>\n<li>Reputable movers will want to take inventory of all your belongings to estimate moving costs and needed labor/equipment.</li>\n<li>Reputable movers won’t ask for a cash or a large deposit. Instead, they’ll ask for payment upon completion of the move.</li>\n<li>Movers will ask you to sign a contract. Review the contract to ensure it includes all items you’re asking them to handle for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"7completehomerepairs\">7) Complete Home Repairs</h3>\n<p>You know what’s better than completing home improvements in your home? Doing them free of furniture and personal clutter. Whether you decide to hire help or take on the improvements yourself, it’s a good idea to handle as many projects as possible before moving in.</p>\n<p>Not only will this remove the stress of protecting your personal belongings, but will also make easier any “behind-the-walls” projects, such as updating wiring or plumbing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafterthemove\">What to Do after the Move</h2>\n<h3 id=\"8changethelocks\">8) Change the Locks</h3>\n<p>Protecting the new home is a top priority for any new homeowner. Changing the locks is the first steps.</p>\n<p>No matter how much you trust the realtor, previous homeowners, or contractors, it’s hard to tell how many copies of your home’s keys are around. After changing the locks, have a few copies made for yourself, the other residents, and a trusted person (e.g. neighbor or nearby friend) for emergencies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9developemergencyplans\">9) Develop Emergency Plans</h3>\n<p>Fires, pipe bursts, blown fuses. Even in a new home, accidents can happen, which is why you should have an emergency plan in place. Specifically, you should do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an emergency contact list, complete with the numbers for local services (e.g. electrician, plumber) and addresses of area hospitals.</li>\n<li>Know the location of your shut-off valves. There are two types of valves: those that service specific appliances (e.g. stove, toilet) and “master” valves that direct water or gas into your home.</li>\n<li>Have a fire plan in place, which should include available exits from every room and a meeting location away from the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"10getasafe\">10) Get a Safe</h3>\n<p>If moving into a new home can show us anything, it’s that we have a lot of important documents that need to be stored properly. Home insurance policies, closing documents, and mortgage records are just a few of the items homeowners may need to have in the event of an emergency. Off-site safes are also good for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have one already, consider getting a safe or filing cabinet to store these items. Other important things to consider adding to the safe could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appraisals and home inventories</li>\n<li>Contractor bills and estimates</li>\n<li>Instruction manual for electronics or furniture</li>\n<li>Tax returns</li>\n<li>Wills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"11createamaintenancechecklist\">11) Create a Maintenance Checklist</h3>\n<p>New homeowners will want to keep their home in as best shape as possible. Creating a maintenance checklist will help do just that.</p>\n<p>Home maintenance checklists are great because they can remind you of infrequent, yet routine, items that are important for your home (think checking the smoke detector or replacing furnace pads). Some great checklist templates are available at <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/home-maintenance-checklist-1388708\">The Balance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mrhandyman.com/blog/2013/march/home-maintenance-checklist-printable-maintenance/\">Mr. Handyman</a>.</p>\n<p>Moving into a new house can be one of the most stressful, yet satisfying, times in your life. After all, it’s a place that’s all your own, a place to call home for yourself and your family. Having a checklist of everything you need will help reduce the anxiety that you’ll feel during the big move and keep you focused on the excitement of waking up in your new home.</p>"

    body: "<p>As an insurance company that serves catastrophe-prone states like Florida and Louisiana, we've seen the power of hurricanes firsthand and have helped our homeowners navigate their aftermath. (Just look at <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">our response to Hurricane Irma</a> in 2017 for a snapshot!)</p>\n<p>So we wanted to share some of our historical hurricane knowledge with you. If these hurricane facts aren't enough to inspire you to <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">prepare for the next big storm</a>, we're not sure what will!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1the2020atlantichurricaneseasonsaw30namedstorms\">1. The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Saw 30 Named Storms</h2>\n<p>The 2005 season had more hurricanes (15), but <a href=\"/blog/atlantic-hurricane-season-2021/\">2020 was the most active year on record</a>, with 30 named storms, 14 of which were hurricanes. And of those 14, seven of them were major hurricanes.</p>\n<p>It's further proof that <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-and-home-insurance/\">climate change is making active hurricane seasons the new normal</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2hurricanescanunleashmorethan24trilliongallonsofrainperday\">2. Hurricanes Can Unleash More Than 2.4 Trillion Gallons of Rain Per Day</h2>\n<p>While hurricane winds that can top 160 mph get most of the headlines, the deluge they bring can be just as damaging. Just take 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as an example. When all was said and done, Harvey dumped <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/08/30/harvey-has-unloaded-24-5-trillion-gallons-of-water-on-texas-and-louisiana/\">33 trillion gallons of water</a> on the US – enough to fill a 3.1 square mile cube.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3floridagetsmorehurricanesthananyotherstate\">3. Florida Gets More Hurricanes Than Any Other State</h2>\n<p>Between 1885 and 2020, Floridians have suffered <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/#landfalls-by-state\">120 direct hits</a>, which is about 40 percent of the hurricanes to make landfall in the United States during the same period. The Sunshine State has also seen half of the country’s Category 5 storms (2) and 42 percent of the Category 4 storms (11).</p>\n<h2 id=\"4thelongesthurricanelasted31days\">4. The Longest Hurricane Lasted 31 Days</h2>\n<p>Not only did Hurricane John, a Category 5 storm, last from July 25 to September 13, 1994, but it also traveled 7,165 miles between the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This makes it both the farthest-traveled hurricane and one of a handful that has also been classified as a typhoon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5hurricaneallenreachedmaximumsustainedwindsof190mph\">5. Hurricane Allen Reached Maximum Sustained Winds of 190 MPH</h2>\n<p>This speed gives Hurricane Allen the record for most intense hurricane in the Atlantic if you measure it by maximum sustained winds. Its formation on July 31, 1980, also made it the earliest Category 5 hurricane until 2005, when Hurricane Emily roared to life on July 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6hurricanecomesfromthetainowordhuracan\">6. “Hurricane” Comes from the Taino Word “Huraca’n”</h2>\n<p>The Taino, the indigenous people of the Caribbean, believed the <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/hurricane-from-the-goddess-guabancex-to-fierce-irene\">god Juracan caused huraca’n</a> through the handiwork of an angry goddess named Guabancex and her companions Guatabá and Coatrisquie. Guabancex brought the wind, Guatabá was responsible for the lightning and thunder, and Coatrisquie caused the floods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7hurricaneswereoriginallyonlynamedafterwomen\">7. Hurricanes Were Originally Only Named After Women</h2>\n<p>In the US, the National Hurricane Center first <a href=\"/blog/how-are-hurricanes-named/\">started naming hurricanes in 1953</a>, but only used female names. Prior to this, hurricanes were designated by Catholic saint days, the places where they made landfall, and sometimes even the property they destroyed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8bobwasthefirstmalenameforahurricane\">8. Bob Was the First Male Name for a Hurricane</h2>\n<p>The practice of only using female names was dropped in 1978, thanks in part to civil rights activist and Florida feminist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxcy_Bolton#Hurricane_renaming\">Roxcy Bolton</a>. She persuaded the national weather forecasters to include male names for tropical storms, arguing that associating just women with disasters was regressive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9thenamesofthemostdevastatinghurricanesareretired\">9. The Names of the Most Devastating Hurricanes Are Retired</h2>\n<p>The World Meteorological Organization, which now maintains and rotates through six lists of hurricane names for the Atlantic, has <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\">retired 93 names</a> for the destruction they caused. The 2005 season saw the most names retired – five total, including Katrina and Rita. Laura, Eta, and Iota were all retired after 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10openingwindowsinahurricanedoesnotprotectyourhome\">10. Opening Windows in a Hurricane Does Not Protect Your Home</h2>\n<p>Many people think they need to keep their windows open during hurricanes, believing it equalizes pressure in the house, but that's a myth, and a bad one. Open windows may actually allow debris and water that can cause serious damage.</p>\n<p>Instead, make sure your windows are boarded up with plywood or <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane-protection shutters</a> and close your interior doors. Leaving those open compartmentalizes pressure so wind that does get in doesn’t cause your roof to blow off, according to a <a href=\"https://ibhs.org/ibhs-news-releases/shutting-the-bedroom-door-could-save-your-roof-during-a-hurricane/\">press release from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11ahurricaneseyewallpresentsthegreatestdanger\">11. A Hurricane’s Eyewall Presents the Greatest Danger</h2>\n<p>The eyewall is the spiraling bands of wind and rain that radiate from the center of a hurricane that gives these storms their distinctive buzzsaw shape. And just like in humans, you can tell a lot about hurricanes by their eyes.</p>\n<p>A ragged, asymmetrical eye means the storm is struggling to strengthen, while a smooth, round eye means that it’s stable and quite strong. On the other hand, a tiny eye –known as a pinhole or pinpoint eye – is a sign of a very intense storm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12somehurricaneshavetwoeyewalls\">12. Some Hurricanes Have Two Eyewalls</h2>\n<p>This process is known as an “eyewall replacement cycle,” which is where a storm develops a new eyewall to replace the old one. An eyewall replacement cycle usually lessens the intensity of the hurricane, but it also spreads out the eye so the hurricane doesn’t have to get as close to land to cause damage, as seen in <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-10-nasa-hurricane-matthew-eyewalls.html\">Hurricane Matthew in October 2016</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13hurricanesspinindifferentdirections\">13. Hurricanes Spin in Different Directions</h2>\n<p>How a hurricane spins depends on which hemisphere it’s from. Hurricanes in the Southern Hemisphere spin in a clockwise direction whereas hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere turn counterclockwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14ahurricanesavedjapanfromattack\">14. A Hurricane Saved Japan from Attack</h2>\n<p>When the Mongols attempted an invasion of Japan in 1281, their attack was <a href=\"http://www.hurricanescience.org/history/storms/pre1900s/1281/\">halted thanks to a hurricane</a> – technically a typhoon because of its location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15hurricanesoftencausetornadoes\">15. Hurricanes Often Cause Tornadoes</h2>\n<p>The tornadoes that come with hurricanes are usually weaker and last a shorter time than the hurricane-free variety, but they can still do some damage. This is especially true when hurricanes cause multiple tornadoes, like Hurricane Ivan did in 2004. It holds the record for most tornadoes spawned with 120.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that can cover repairs to the home and other structures caused by hurricane winds.

    body: "<p>Knowing what your insurance covers is essential for homeowners. After all, if you understand what’s covered and what’s not, you can make sure you have adequate protection. You can identify the add-ons that fit your unique situation. Plus, you’re less likely to file claims that get denied.</p>\n<p>However, a <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/is-your-home-insurance-ready-for-extreme-weather/\">Realtor.com study</a> recently revealed that 15 percent of homeowners not only have no idea what their insurance covers, but they also weren’t even sure what to check. Another 29 percent thought they knew what their policies covered, but learned most of that while shopping for coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5detailstocheckinyourhomeinsurancepolicy\">5 Details to Check in Your Home Insurance Policy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> doesn’t have to be hard – we promise! And to prove it, we’ve laid out some of the key details just as one of our representatives would if you called them on the phone. That means we use easy-to-digest language to explain your policy’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage.</li>\n<li>Deductibles.</li>\n<li>Exclusions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customers who know more about home insurance ask better questions and provide more accurate information when they apply for coverage. By the time you get to the end of this post, we want you to have a solid handle on what homeowners insurance covers so you can buy the right policy for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1coverage\">1. Coverage</h3>\n<p>One of the things that confuses people about homeowners insurance is that it’s a single policy, but it’s typically split into six coverage parts or sections. Each coverage kicks in for a different type of financial loss. The six basic coverages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling coverage</a> insures your home’s physical structure and pays to repair or replace it if it’s damaged by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other structures coverage </a>pays for damage to structures that are on your property but aren’t attached to your home, like sheds and gazebos.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">Personal property coverage</a> covers your belongings like appliances, electronics, and clothing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use coverage</a> pays for your additional living expenses if your home is made uninhabitable by a covered peril.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> helps with your legal costs if you're sued for someone’s injuries or property damages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> pays your guests’ immediate medical costs if they're hurt on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2coveragelimits\">2. Coverage Limits</h3>\n<p>The six coverages in homeowners insurance usually have separate limits, or the maximum amount your insurance company pays in a covered claim. Coverage limits can be a percentage of the limit you have on your dwelling coverage. This is typically true for the coverage limits on your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other structures.</li>\n<li>Personal property.</li>\n<li>Loss of use coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your coverages may also have sublimits. A sublimit is the maximum amount your insurance company pays in a particular type of claim. High-value personal property, like fine art or jewelry, often has a sublimit. So you could have $50,000 of personal property coverage, but your insurance company might limit what it pays for jewelry to just $1,500. That may not be enough to pay for damage to something really valuable, like an engagement ring.</p>\n<p>Moreover, sublimits are usually still part of your coverage limit. This your $1,500 jewelry claim also reduces the amount of coverage you have for any other personal property claims you make during your policy term.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3deductibles\">3. Deductibles</h3>\n<p>A deductible is what you pay for a claim before your insurance policy kicks in. For example, let’s say a fire causes $10,000 worth of damage to your dwelling. Your dwelling coverage limit of $250,000 can easily cover that, but your policy also requires you to pay a $500 deductible. You cover that $500 first, and then your insurance carrier pays the remaining $9,500.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance policies can also have more than one deductible, particularly in areas with unique weather risks. Florida is a good example of this because most <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance policies</a> have both a standard deductible and a hurricane deductible. Louisiana homeowners insurance, however, often has both of those and a <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a>.</p>\n<p>Opting for a higher deductible can help you keep premiums down. However, you don’t want to be stuck paying huge out-of-pocket expenses in a claim, so be sure to choose a deductible you can afford.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4exclusions\">4. Exclusions</h3>\n<p>Your homeowners policy also has perils that it doesn’t cover. These are called <a href=\"/glossary/exclusion/\">exclusions</a>, and home insurance usually handles them in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open perils coverage.</strong> Sometimes described as an “all-risk policy,” an open perils policy covers events unless they are specifically mentioned as excluded in the policy language. Common exclusions include flooding and earth movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Named perils coverage.</strong> This type of home insurance only covers perils that are listed in the policy language. There are usually about 16 perils that are named, and therefore covered, by this policy. Anything else is considered an exclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you commit to an insurance policy, you want to know which type of coverage you're getting. Our policies insure your dwelling on an open-perils basis, which many people prefer because it covers so many more risks. Your personal property, however, is usually covered on a named-risk basis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5endorsements\">5. Endorsements</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">Insurance endorsements</a> are key to making sure your homeowners insurance covers what you need it to because they let you add or change coverage. For example, we offer endorsements that cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">Animal liability</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/golf-cart-insurance/\">Golf carts</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">Water backup and sump overflow</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This checklist should be enough to help you find home insurance that fits your situation. But If you still have questions, don’t be afraid to talk to your insurance representative. We want you to understand what your homeowners insurance covers so you get the right protection.</p>"

    body: "<p>Spring is the season for renewal, and for a lot of people, that means getting their homes in tip-top shape. Whether you’re looking to do a thorough clean or simply organize your stuff, we’ve got spring cleaning tips to make your work easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeaplan\">Make a Plan</h2>\n<p>Spring cleaning seldom gets done in a day, so create a schedule for getting them done. Walk around your home with a notebook or voice recorder and note all of the tasks you want to accomplish. Once you have a list, decide how you want to tackle it. Many people focus on one room at a time, but others prefer to start with jobs that apply to all rooms. Either way, schedule each spring cleaning task and check it off your list as you complete it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"declutteryourhome\">Declutter Your Home</h2>\n<p>Cluttered rooms are like nails on a chalkboard for some people. But even if you’ve learned to tolerate your messy living room, leaving it that way makes it difficult to clean. Set aside time to rid your home of clutter, and make sure you toss out or donate items you have multiples of or that you haven’t used in a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizeyourstuff\">Organize Your Stuff</h2>\n<p>After you declutter, you still need to organize the belongings you keep. Put these items back in their appropriate location. And if things don’t have their own place, start looking at organization solutions﹘but be careful! You don’t want to buy more storage containers without a plan for where they will go and what you’ll put into them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downloadanapp\">Download an App</h2>\n<p>Technology hasn’t fully conquered housekeeping chores, but there are several <a href=\"/blog/10-spring-cleaning-apps/\">apps that make spring cleaning a breeze</a>. Some apps. like Decluttr, Poshmark, and NextDoor, can all save you from the headache of a yard pile once you have a pile of used items to sell. Another app, Centriq, helps you organize routine household chores by scheduling maintenance reminders and storing appliance manuals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkforwaterintrusion\">Check for Water Intrusion</h2>\n<p>Speaking of routine maintenance, spring is a great time to find pesky water intrusion. Look around under your kitchen and bathroom sinks to see if there is any moisture accumulation, and inspect your water heater for leaks and rust. You should also walk the length of any walls with pipes inside to look for signs of moisture and mold. While your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> typically covers sudden, accidental water damage, you’re better off avoiding trouble in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearoutdrawers\">Clear Out Drawers</h2>\n<p>We all have one﹘that dreaded junk drawer filled with anything and everything that doesn’t have a home. Most of the stuff saved in your junk drawer are things you thought you’d need or hated to throw out. Either way, spring is the time to rethink that choice. Take some time to go through your junk drawer (or drawers, as the case may be) and dump all of the useless odds and ends you find.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleanoutyourpantryandrefrigerator\">Clean Out Your Pantry and Refrigerator</h2>\n<p>Does the food in your fridge remind you of an eighth-grade science fair project? Are some of your products in your pantry older than your oldest child? If so, then it’s time to clean both out. First, toss expired products. Then wipe down shelves and the spouts of condiment bottles. As you go through your pantry, set aside unexpired items that you don’t think you’ll use and donate them to a food bank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startatthetop\">Start at the Top</h2>\n<p>When you’re ready to tackle a room, your best bet is to clean from the top to the bottom. Start the highest fixtures, like ceiling fans, crown molding, and shelves, then work your way down to tables and chairs, and end with the floor. That way, all the dust and debris falls to the ground and you only have to vacuum or sweep one time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"washyourwindows\">Wash Your Windows</h2>\n<p>Most of us clean our floors regularly, but spring’s warmer weather means it’s a good time to wash your window. The first step is to mix two gallons of warm water with a teaspoon of dish soap. Next, head outside a long handled microfiber mop or squeegee. Remove your window screens, dip your mop or squeegee in your cleaning mixture, and scrub your windows clean. Finally, spray them with a streak-free glass cleaner and wipe them with a microfiber cloth.</p>\n<p>The steps are pretty much the same for your window interiors, except you’ll first want to remove window coverings, sweep up any dirt or dust, and wipe down your window frames. While you're at it, you might want to toss your drapes in the laundry and dust your blinds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleanwithsteam\">Clean with Steam</h2>\n<p>Steam cleaners use water vapor at high temperatures to clean and disinfect, so they eliminate the need for harsh chemicals and cleaners. You can use steam to clean floors and counters in both the bathroom and kitchen, assuming the surfaces are sealed. Some people even use them on stainless steel appliances and the inside of refrigerators.</p>\n<p>There are some situations, however, where steam cleaners aren’t the right tool for the job. For example, you probably shouldn’t try to steam clean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsealed surfaces, like natural stone or hardwood floors</li>\n<li>Porous surfaces, like bamboo.</li>\n<li>Surfaces finished with water-based paint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you opt for a steam cleaner, make sure you read the manufacturer’s instructions first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"considerahighefficiencyparticulateairvacuum\">Consider a High-Efficiency Particulate Air Vacuum</h2>\n<p>High-efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuums catch tiny, airborne particles that other vacuum cleaners miss, such as pet dander, dust mites and dust. This makes them a huge boon to anyone who suffers from allergies. Be sure to look for HEPA vacuum where the motor and the bag are both completely sealed with rubber gaskets to keep allergens from escaping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replaceyourairfilters\">Replace Your Air Filters</h2>\n<p>Did you know that the typical house needs new air filters once every three months? Add a pet, and you need to change your air filter every two months. Replacing your air filters is a simple home maintenance task that helps keep your home and the air you breathe clean, so add it to your spring cleaning to-do list. And when you look for a replacement filter, be sure to check its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-merv-rating\">minimum efficiency reporting value</a> (MERV). The higher the fitler’s MERV rating, the better job it does of trapping particles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scrubyourbathrooms\">Scrub Your Bathrooms</h2>\n<p>Bathroom’s get cleaned regularly, but spring cleaning is a chance to give yours a major scrub down. Key spring cleaning tips for your bathroom include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work from top to bottom, but also from one end of the room to another so you don’t have to do any cleaning twice.</li>\n<li>Use a mixture of warm water and dish soap to wipe down your bathroom walls, backsplash, cabinets, and countertops.</li>\n<li>Wash your shower curtain in your laundry machine on the gentle cycle, then let it air dry. (If it’s plastic, throw in a few towels to protect it.)</li>\n<li>Soak your showerhead in vinegar overnight and scrub it with a toothbrush to get rid of hard water buildup. (Brass-, nickel-, and gold-coated fixtures should only soak for 30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Discard old medicines, makeup, and hair products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cleanthemicrowave\">Clean the Microwave</h2>\n<p>Microwaves are famous for having food spatters that can be challenging to clean, but you can make this task easier by filling a bowl with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One cup of water.</li>\n<li>A chopped-up lemon.</li>\n<li>Three tablespoons of vinegar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Place this in your microwave on high for three minutes. Remove the bowl﹘it’s hot, so use gloves!﹘and then wipe down the walls and turntable with a damp cloth. The grime should come right off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"washyourreusablegrocerybags\">Wash Your Reusable Grocery Bags</h2>\n<p>Reusable grocery bags are great for the environment, but they can get grimy over time. You can throw most canvas bags in the washing machine, but heavy-duty plastic bags need to be cleaned by hand. Use a gentle cleaning solution on both the inside and outside.</p>"

Creating good bookkeeping habits now can be a huge help.</p>\n<p>Your process can be as simple or as complicated as you want – there’s plenty of accounting software to choose from. The important thing is to keep a good record of your deposits, rents, and expenses, like the mortgage, property taxes, maintenance expenses, and any materials used on the property. For example, if you buy cleaning supplies to clean the property, that’s a deductible expense.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2geteverythinginwriting\">2. Get Everything in Writing</h2>\n<p>You know how important a lease is – you can’t do business on a handshake alone! But don’t assume that a boilerplate lease accounts for everything. Make sure your lease clearly outlines your policies about late rent, subletting, pets, noise complaints, etc.</p>\n<p>Every communication you have with tenants about the property should be in writing, too. This includes giving tenants notice when maintenance workers need to stop by or when you’d like to show the property. If there is ever a dispute, you can rely on these records to show you complied with your state’s notice requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3planfortaxes\">3. Plan for Taxes</h2>\n<p>If you only own one property, it can be easy to forget that you’re technically running a business. But you are, and you need to <a href=\"/blog/tax-planning-strategies/\">plan for taxes</a> accordingly. Remember that rent payments are considered income and what you spend to maintain the property is considered an expense.</p>\n<p>It’s smart to talk with a tax advisor before you become a landlord so that you know exactly what to expect on your taxes. For example, you may need to start paying estimated <a href=\"https://www.thebalancesmb.com/self-employment-taxes-what-you-need-to-know-397678\">self-employment taxes</a> on a quarterly basis. This covers your Social Security and Medicare tax obligations, similar to what your employer would withhold from your paychecks. You’re often required to pay these at the federal, state, and city level.</p>\n<p>You also don’t want to miss out on <a href=\"/blog/florida-property-tax-exemptions/\">property tax exemptions</a> that may help ease your tax burden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4knowthehousinglawsinyourarea\">4. Know the Housing Laws in Your Area</h2>\n<p>You will probably need to apply for a Certificate of Occupancy in the county where your property is. This will often give you a crash course on the housing laws and tenant rights in your area.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t need a COO, make sure you understand your responsibilities to your tenants. At the end of the day, ignorance isn’t a defense if there’s a problem with the property and it doesn’t pass a city housing inspection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5establishbusinesshours\">5. Establish Business Hours</h2>\n<p>Emergencies can and will crop up, but in general, create business hours for yourself and stick to them. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself working around the clock, and that can make any business harder to run.</p>\n<p>Make sure tenants know the days and hours you’re available and give them both your email and phone number. Make it clear that you only respond during business hours unless it’s an emergency, like a plumbing issue with the house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6dontrenttofamilyandfriends\">6. Don’t Rent to Family and Friends</h2>\n<p>It might seem like a win-win situation to rent to someone you already know. But the truth is it’s harder to say no to friends and family, and renting out your property is all about maintaining boundaries. For example, if a friend falls on hard times and can’t pay the rent, they may expect a favor that you wouldn’t give other tenants. The easiest way to treat tenants like clients is to rent to folks you don’t have a personal relationship with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7screenyourtenants\">7. Screen Your Tenants</h2>\n<p>A typical tenant screening usually costs about $50. These often include a credit check, work history, criminal history, and eviction history. Though it’s a little investment, it can help make sure you’re renting to tenants who are financially prepared for their ongoing rent obligations. Calling references can also give you a better sense of who your applicants are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8dontexpectprofitsimmediately\">8. Don’t Expect Profits Immediately</h2>\n<p>If you still have a mortgage on your property, chances are most of your rent payments will go toward the mortgage. Any extra usually goes toward maintenance and upkeep and whatever’s left over is your profit. But even without a lot of profit, your rental property is still valuable. All those rental payments help you build equity, which pays off over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9beclearaboutleaseviolations\">9. Be Clear About Lease Violations</h2>\n<p>Your lease should clearly state what happens when its terms are violated, including late rent, policy violations, and other lease agreements. Clearly outline the process for resolving these violations, such as a written warning, fines, or eviction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10takebeforeandafterphotos\">10. Take Before and After Photos</h2>\n<p>Take before and after photos of the property when tenants leave. While normal wear and tear is to be expected, you want to document damages that the deposit would cover. Photos are your best evidence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11findagreathandyman\">11. Find a Great Handyman</h2>\n<p>Your tenants are entitled to livable space and timely repairs. Even if that weren’t the case, you need to maintain the property to keep up its value. That’s easiest when you have a reliable handyman you can call for maintenance work. They can take care of the little things like leaky faucets or installing a new ceiling fan.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start? Check out this guide for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hiring contractors you can trust</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12installhardwoodflooring\">12. Install Hardwood Flooring</h2>\n<p>Hardwood flooding can be a big selling point for tenants, and it’s easier to clean and harder to stain or damage. Plus, that <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">renovation can increase your property’s value</a>. While you might be required to replace carpets after every few years, you can keep quality hardwood floors for years to come and new tenants will appreciate it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13makeacallonpets\">13. Make a Call on Pets</h2>\n<p>Every animal lover knows that pets can be a handful. Make a call on whether you’ll allow tenants to have pets in your property, and outline those rules clearly in your lease. This might be a no-pet policy or one <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">limiting types of breeds</a> or animals. Or you might allow any kind of pet – your property, your call!</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you’ll need to decide if a pet deposit or pet rent is enough to clean and repair the home after the tenant leaves. The problem is that you really won’t know until after the fact, so it’s something to consider in advance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14prepareforvacancies\">14. Prepare for Vacancies</h2>\n<p>If you go years without a vacancy, consider yourself lucky. Most of the time, you have to prepare for months where you’ll have to cover the mortgage without rental income to offset it. Develop a contingency plan or savings fund for these lean periods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15gettherightinsurance\">15. Get the Right Insurance</h2>\n<p>Protecting your investment property shouldn’t be an afterthought. If you rent out your second home, you might think you just need a regular homeowners insurance policy. But you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> for this situation. It protects the property’s structure, other structures on the premises (like sheds and fences), lost rental income, and liability. Notably, it doesn’t cover all the belongings inside the property – that’s a job for your tenant’s <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">renters policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Need a quote now?

    body: "<p>Capitol Preferred Insurance, a Florida-based insurer, will cancel 23,800 policies because of its precarious financial condition. Florida insurance regulators found the company lost $48.6 million between 2017 and 2019, losses they called “unsustainable.”</p>\n<p>The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation approved the move to cancel these policies in order to protect homeowners.</p>\n<p>The news comes days before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1, and may be a shock to many homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourpolicyisgettingcancelled\">What to Do If Your Policy Is Getting Cancelled</h2>\n<p>If your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is getting cancelled, we suggest two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t panic (you’re gonna be ok!)</li>\n<li>Get a new policy immediately (we can help with that!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can help you get a new policy – and save money in the process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re standing by to quote your home or condo.\n  Call us at <a href=\"tel:855-664-4800\">855-664-4800</a>, or <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote online today</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"findoutifyoureoneoftheimpactedpolicyholders\">Find Out if You’re One of the Impacted Policyholders</h2>\n<p>All of the 23,800 cancelled policies are underwritten by Capitol Preferred. Of those the affected policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Around 19,000 are homeowner (<a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>) policies</li>\n<li>Around 4,500 are condo unit (<a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6</a>) policies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your policy is one of them, you will soon receive a cancellation notice 45 days before the cancellation date.</p>\n<p>Many of these cancelled policies were recently subjected to a 33.5 percent rate increase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getcoveredbeforehurricaneseason\">Get Covered before Hurricane Season</h2>\n<p>It’s important that every affected homeowner gets a new policy in place before June 1, 2020, the <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">start of hurricane season</a>. You don’t want your home left to chance when a major storm strikes.</p>\n<p>Time is of the essence here because when storms approach the Florida coast, many insurance companies (Kin included) will put a moratorium on selling policies until it passes.</p>\n<p>If you wait too long to get a new policy and a moratorium goes into effect, you risk having a lapse in coverage, which can leave you exposed to losses and increase your rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findafinanciallystronginsurancecompany\">Find a Financially Strong Insurance Company</h2>\n<p>Getting a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">policy cancelled</a> can be stressful. And while all the factors that go into a mass cancellation are hard to predict, there are a few ways homeowners can make informed choices when shopping for a new provider.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can make sure your home is insured by a company you can trust.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1learnaboutthecompanysfinancialratings\">1. Learn about the Company’s Financial Ratings</h3>\n<p>We know that an insurance company’s ability to pay claims is incredibly important, especially when you live in Florida and are subject to hurricanes, floods, and the whims of Mother Nature.</p>\n<p>A insurer’s financial strength rating demonstrates its financial outlook and its ability to pay for claims after a widespread disaster. Of the independent rating companies that assess an insurance company’s financial strength, the most popular ratings are issued by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A.M. Best</li>\n<li>Demotech, Inc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s good practice to only buy coverage from an insurance carrier with a solid financial rating. For reference, our financial stability rating is A, Exceptional, from Demotech.</p>\n<p>Capitol Preferred Insurance, and some other Florida carriers, have faced pressure to maintain their financial stability ratings. Though Demotech Inc. <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2020/03/27/562512.htm\">affirmed Capitol Preferred's A rating</a> earlier this year, it’s unclear how recent events will impact that rating in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2lookforacompanythatstransparentaboutitsfinancialhealth\">2. Look for a Company That’s Transparent about its Financial Health</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, insurance isn’t really known for its openness and accessibility. Most homeowners aren’t even sure what their policy covers.</p>\n<p>We don’t think it should work that way. Though the industry is complex and bound by laws and regulations, we believe you should know exactly who you’re trusting with your home. That’s why we keep our customers updated on <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">our financial health</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re proud to have built a reliable insurance company, and we want you to know we’re looking out for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3learnjustalittleaboutreinsurance\">3. Learn (Just a Little) about Reinsurance</h3>\n<p>We don’t expect you to be insurance nerds like us. But if an insurance company has a strong reinsurance program, it means your insurance has insurance.</p>\n<p>Put another way, no matter the catastrophe or amount of claims, a solid reinsurance program is further proof that a company can pay your claims.</p>\n<p>For example, Kin is backed by A-rated and fully collateralized reinsurers. That means we have additional capital to draw from if we ever need to. Our reinsurance program is so stable that, statistically speaking, we would only ever expect to see an event exceed our program once in every 135 years. If that did happen, we still have millions in our own reserve to pay claims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4readthecustomerreviews\">4. Read the Customer Reviews</h3>\n<p>No one wants to trust their home to an insurance company that treats them like a line item. One way to make sure you’re choosing an insurer worthy of your trust?</p>\n<p>Read their <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a>. They’re telling.</p>\n<p>They can offer insight into how much money customers saved, how fast they got insured, and how well the company handled claims.</p>\n<p>We’re proud to say our customers are incredibly satisfied with our service and how much we’ve helped them save over the years.</p>\n<p>Experience it for yourself.

    body: "<p>If you’re like most homeowners, you’re probably always on the lookout for ways to lower your homeowners insurance premium. One of your best options is to take steps to harden your home against the events that can cause damage. Many insurance companies offer premium discounts for installing these three home protection products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homesecuritysystem\">Home security system</h2>\n<p>An easy way to lower your homeowners insurance premium is with a <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-security-system-benefits/\">home security system</a>. The biggest price reductions are often saved for security systems that have motion sensors and cameras. Plus, some insurance companies only offer discounts for <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">central alarm systems</a>.</p>\n<p>Security systems with these features help deter possible intruders who often look for an easier target once they realize a home is protected. In the event that there is an incident, law enforcement can use the camera’s footage to help find the culprits and reclaim stolen items.</p>\n<p>Home security systems may cost anywhere from $199 to $399 for a package or kit, and you should expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $50 per month for monitoring. Many systems are designed to be self-installed, but if you are getting installation, there may be an additional installation fee. The good news is that there are security systems that fit into just about any budget.</p>\n<h2 id=\"waterandclimatesensors\">Water and climate sensors</h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever had your pipes burst or returned home to a flooded basement, you know how serious water damage can be. Water issues are common, too: homes are two times more likely to experience water damage than fire and theft combined.</p>\n<p>Water and climate sensors monitor temperature and humidity, alerting your smartphone when water is detected. They’re easy to install, too. Just place them on a wall or on the ground in areas that might be prone to leaks.</p>\n<p>These sensors can alert you to water damage before it gets out of hand, sparing your home from expensive damage and decreasing the chance of filing claims. The fewer claims you have, the cheaper your homeowners insurance is.</p>\n<p>Sensors can cost anywhere from $29.99 to $80 depending on the manufacturer and model. Do your homework and read customer reviews about sensors to make sure that you choose a reliable option that will not fail in the event of water intrusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thirdnailinstallation\">Third nail installation</h2>\n<p>The number one way to save big bucks on <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is through wind mitigation credits. The more wind resistant your home is, the lower your premium will be.</p>\n<p>If your home was built before 2002, then your roof may need a little love to make sure it can withstand hurricane winds. Folks with older homes often benefit from working with a licensed general contractor that specializes in truss mitigation and hurricane retrofits in Florida. If your roof truss has “toe nails,” they can simply <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">add a third nail</a> to help your home qualify for the “clips” discount noted in your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a>.</p>\n<p>While that third nail might not seem like much, it can make a big difference in how much you pay for homeowners insurance. You can save 20 to 50 percent on your total premium by upgrading your roof-to-wall attachment from toe nails to clips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyinsurancecompaniesgivediscountsfortheseproducts\">Why insurance companies give discounts for these products</h2>\n<p>Home insurance companies are in the business of providing financial protection against certain risks homeowners face. When a homeowner can reduce the risk, the insurance carrier views that homeowner favorably and often offers a discount for hardening the home against <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>.</p>\n<p>While you may not think these products offer significant protection, there is evidence that suggests otherwise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security company ADT says <a href=\"https://www.adt.com/resources/do-surveillance-cameras-statistically-reduce-crime\">surveillance cameras deter crime</a>, cutting criminal activity in one city by 50 percent.</li>\n<li>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) claims that just one inch of water can lead to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf\">$25,000 or more</a> in damages to your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you reduce the risk of a loss, you reduce the chance your insurance company will have to pay a claim. So insurers encourage good risk management by offering a financial incentive (i.e., a premium discount).</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a claim doesn’t need to involve a natural disaster to be catastrophic to your home. Just a small incident can lead to a big claim.</p>\n<p>For example, a pipe bursting in your kitchen or bathroom can easily produce an inch of water. And it’s not just the floor that might suffer water damage. Your floors, cabinets, appliances, even your foundation could feel the effects. That’s why you should look into getting these products. You may have to shell out a few bucks, but security systems, water sensors, and hurricane clips usually pay for themselves in lower home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>To learn more about home insurance and how you might save on your costs, give us a call at 855-717-0022 or <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start/\">start your application</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in March 2017.

    body: "<p>The holidays can be hectic. It’s a time for family, food and togetherness, but the holidays are also filled with higher instances of home thefts, fires and insurance claims than any other time of year. These are three things to keep an eye on this holiday season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1lockyourdoors\">1. Lock Your Doors</h2>\n<p>During the holidays, folks are more inclined to be out and about going to parties, and shopping for presents, food, or decorations. For many, it is a couple months full of nonstop events, creating overwhelming feelings of anxiety and stress. With all of those trips out, it’s easy to forget fundamental tasks like locking your doors or turning on your security system. In fact, theft increases 7% during the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Here are a few more tips to prevent theft:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have outside Christmas lights, make sure not to run the cords from an indoor outlet through an open window or door.</li>\n<li>Do not leave the check-out line with money or a credit card in your hand, put all monies in a secure spot like a wallet or zipped purse before leaving.</li>\n<li>Do not leave shopping bags in plain site in your car. Put in the trunk or cover bags with a blanket and put on the floor.</li>\n<li>If you are going out of town over the holidays, have a neighbor or loved one keep an eye on your house by getting your mail, so it looks like the home is occupied.</li>\n<li>Install timers on lights so that you look like you’re home even when you aren’t. You can use them to light up your outside lights and even a few interior lights so it looks like someone’s in the house.</li>\n<li>Point security cameras at windows in the home where the tree is closest. Criminals often try to reach in from a window to steal presents.</li>\n<li>Install motion sensor lights outside of your home. Plus, motion sensor lights stay on even when the Christmas lights go off.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2dontpoptoomuchchampagne\">2. Don't Pop Too Much Champagne</h2>\n<p>We’ve all been to a <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">holiday</a> party where someone’s had too much to drink. Liquor and alcohol sales rise about 25-30% in December and about 40% of traffic-related deaths during Christmas and New Year's involve drunk drivers. Despite the availability of Uber and Lyft, too many people get behind the wheel while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>Homeowners should be aware of the perils facing them as they <a href=\"/blog/holidays-home-insurance-impact/\">host holiday parties</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal liability risks go up with inebriated party goers, as they're more likely to hurt themselves or others.</li>\n<li>With more decorations and holiday cheer comes increased risk of property damage.</li>\n<li>Alcohol also makes people less cognizant of time so cooking under the influence can lead to fire from the burning food.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One step you can take is to be smart about when you drink. If you invite people over, perhaps drink less yourself. That way, you can make sure people are having fun and find them a ride if they over indulge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3watchoutforchestnutsroastingonanopenfire\">3. Watch Out for Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire</h2>\n<p>Who doesn’t love watching the fire burn as family gathers around the Christmas tree to open gifts, or lighting candles to fill the home with holiday cheer? Astoundingly, the average Christmas tree related fire claim is a whopping $100,000! <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">Home fire claims jump 15% during the holiday season</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your flames safely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only light candles in an open area</li>\n<li>People commonly use candles as centerpieces on the table for holiday feasts. But with all the shuffling and passing of food they can get knocked over, so artificial lights are a better alternative.</li>\n<li>Appoint a family member to be on “candle duty” to make sure all are blown out before bedtime.</li>\n<li>Keep your Christmas tree watered and away from heat, making sure to dispose of it before it gets too dry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking out for these things won't make you a Scrooge! So have fun, be jolly, spread the cheer and keep an extra eye on your surroundings.</p>"

    body: "<p>Big, exciting news! We’re happy to announce we raised $35 million in Series B funding from a team of visionary investors.</p>\n<p>The funding was led by Commerce Ventures with participation from Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (doing its reinsurance business as HSCM Bermuda), Flourish Ventures, QED, Alpha Edison, Allegis NL Capital, Avanta Ventures (venture arm of CSAA Insurance Group, a AAA Insurer), August Capital, the <a href=\"https://polsky.uchicago.edu/2020/08/13/kin-insurance-secures-second-investment-from-uchicago-startup-program/\">University of Chicago via its Startup Investment Program</a>, and others. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200813005588/en/Kin-Insurance-Closes-35M-Series-Fuel-Industry\">Read all about it here</a>.</p>\n<p>This round brings our total funding to date to $86 million, and our total insured value (TIV) to more than $4 billion.</p>\n<p>Our latest funding will help us grow so we can keep expanding across the US. In fact, since last year, we’ve more than doubled the size of our team, and <a href=\"/careers/\">we're currently hiring</a> in Chicago, Illinois; St. Petersburg, Florida; and Phoenix, Arizona.</p>\n<p>All this will continue to fuel our mission to forever change insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changinghomeinsuranceasweknowit\">Changing Home Insurance As We Know It</h2>\n<p>Home insurance is broken. To be exact:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It’s painfully expensive and hard to get.</strong> That’s especially true if you live in an area where you really, really need insurance (hi, <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>It’s one of the lowest rated industries in customer satisfaction and service.</strong> On average, 65 percent of folks wouldn't recommend their home insurer to a friend. Yikes.</li>\n<li><strong>It wastes BILLIONS of consumer dollars on old technology and agents.</strong> Did you know 17 percent of your premium dollars go toward outside agents, not paying your claims? And another 15 percent is wasted on administrative costs that could be cut with technology that actually works.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be this way, and Kin is proof of that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"puttingtechbackinhomeinsurance\">Putting Tech Back in Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>Back in 2016 when we first got our start, our founders took a look at this industry and saw its real potential: <strong>insurance is supposed to be a tech-driven product</strong>. You can’t exactly hold it in your hands, right?</p>\n<p>So we built our company from the ground up to digitize everything.</p>\n<p>The result? We can <a href=\"https://medium.com/kin-insurance/oral-history-of-how-we-launched-mobile-home-insurance-42c624292f99\">launch new products in a week</a> (like we did with mobile home insurance in Florida), price risks in real time, and crunch thousands of data points about each home to customize coverage in minutes. And most importantly, <a href=\"/reviews/\">our customers are super happy</a>.</p>\n<p>In the words of our CEO Sean Harper, “We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most. We’ve been able to innovate much faster because we depend less on legacy insurance infrastructure.”</p>\n<p>That technology also cuts out unnecessary expenses, too. What we don’t spend on overhead, administrative costs, and outside agents, we can pass along as savings to you. On average, our <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey/\">customers save $500 when they switch to Kin</a>.</p>\n<p>Turns out, there’s a lot of support for the solution we’re offering, and we’re excited to serve more states soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks for joining us on this journey, friends, and stay tuned for more updates. The future looks bright.</p>"

    body: "<p>During the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.getbellhops.com/blog/moving-statistics/\">27 million Americans</a> relocated to a new area. That's down from the previous five-year annual average of 40 million, but it's still a lot of people looking for (hopefully) greener pastures.</p>\n<p>But how do you pick the right area for you and your family to move to? Before you start the process of choosing a city, it's smart to do some research and learn about the city's attractions – and drawbacks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethesafestcitiesintheus\">What are the safest cities in the US?</h2>\n<p>For many Americans, the right city has a strong economy, good job opportunities, amenities for families, and low crime rates. While you can (and should) <a href=\"https://www.alarmgrid.com/monitoring\">monitor your home</a> no matter where you live, an area with lower property crime rates can <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">reduce your home insurance premiums</a> because you are statistically less likely to be the victim of a break-in.</p>\n<p>The following cities all have violent crime rates <a href=\"https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-metro-cities/\">1.19 lower than the national average</a> and property crime rates 1.06 times lower than the national average. That's important because low crime rates tend to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/27/crime-rates-lower-in-these-us-safest-cities/40406533/\">correlate with economic prosperity</a>. With that in mind, here are four of the safest metro cities in America.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1virginiabeachvirginiaisagreatcoastalcommunity\">1. Virginia Beach, Virginia is a great coastal community</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/va%20beach.jpg\" alt=\"va beach\" /></p>\n<p>Want to shake off the grind of city living and trade it in for a life in a coastal community? If so, then Virginia Beach, Virginia may be the right place for you. With a population of just over 450,000 people, this coastal jewel has a very low property crime rate (19.35 per 1,000) and a median income of $70,500. One of the best parts about living in this city is the beautiful scenery.</p>\n<p>Most Virginia Beach residents bike around in the downtown area to take in the scenery and enjoy the great weather. Plus, public transportation is readily available – think trolleys, shuttles, ferries, and buses. It's also home to more millennials per capita than any other city in America. Regardless of your age, Virginia Beach has something for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2elpasotexasisoneofthesafestmetrocitiesinamerica\">2. El Paso, Texas is one of the safest metro cities in America</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/el%20paso.jpg\" alt=\"el paso\" /></p>\n<p>El Paso, Texas has a population of around 688,000 people and has a median household income of $44,000 a year. While the median income this city has is below the national average, El Paso has a very low property crime rate: 18.19 per 1,000. Ask anyone who lives in this great Texas city why they love it so much and they are sure to mention the vibrancy and tight-knit local community.</p>\n<p>Not only is this city home to vibrant, multicultural communities, but it is also a proud supporter of the arts. Downtown El Paso is rich with art studios and museums, providing plenty of cultural activities for the whole family to enjoy. El Paso also has plenty of other forms of entertainment: water parks, movie theaters, and restaurants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3anaheimcaliforniaisthecityofkindness\">3. Anaheim, California is the 'City of Kindness'</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/anaheim.jpg\" alt=\"anaheim\" /></p>\n<p>In the past few years, lawmakers in Anaheim, California have passed initiatives like the City of Kindness, which is designed to amplify community engagement and acts of kindness. With a population of more than 350,000, the initiative is already making a difference – property crime is only 26.3 per 1,000, and violent crime is a 3.55 per 1,000.</p>\n<p>The median income in Anaheim is about $65,000, which is slightly higher than the national median of about $63,000. Anaheim also boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, which is great news for people who are looking for a job before moving to this area. With more than 74 public schools and several colleges within a 20-mile range, Anaheim is a great spot for families who want options when it comes to a good education for their children.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4tampafloridaisagreatplacetoraiseafamily\">4. Tampa, Florida is a great place to raise a family</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tampa%20skyline.jpg\" alt=\"tampa skyline\" /></p>\n<p>Looking for great weather and community? <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa, Florida</a> might be the safe city for you. In addition to having a low property crime rate (17.44 per 1,000), with over 380,000 residents, it's one of the fastest-growing cities in the state of Florida.</p>\n<p>The cost of living in this city is low, which means your already dollars go further here. You can also take <a href=\"/blog/kin-is-a-home-insurance-carrier/\">advantage of Kin's affordable Florida home insurance rates</a> and put your savings toward all the leisure and recreation Tampa has to offer – it's only a 20 minute drive away from Disney World, after all.</p>"

    body: "<p>Thanksgiving is a time to gather and share blessings with family and friends, but extra people around the table often means increased risk for the homeowners. We’ve compiled a list of the most common Thanksgiving disasters so that you can avoid them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1turkeyfryerfires\">1. Turkey fryer fires</h2>\n<p>Each year, more than <a href=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2012/11/21/top-10-u-s-states-for-turkey-fryer-fires/\">1,000 turkey fryer fires</a> ruin Thanksgiving. That’s hardly a surprise considering you’re dropping a raw bird into a vat of hot oil. But the potential explosion from not drying or thawing your turkey sufficiently is only one of your risks. Turkey fryers can also start fires if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use too much oil.</li>\n<li>Knock over the fryer.</li>\n<li>Overheat the oil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, deep-fried turkey is delicious and a staple at many Thanksgiving tables. So if you can’t pass it up, you may be able to <a href=\"/blog/avoid-turkey-fryer-fires/\">avoid a turkey fryer fire</a> by thawing the bird completely, keeping flammables a safe distance away, and never overfilling the fryer. While you’re at it, keep the children far from this Thanksgiving tradition. In fact, clear the area when you’re about to plop the bird in the pot.</p>\n<p>If you do have a fire, use a fire extinguisher to put it out – never water. (In case we haven’t made this clear, water and oil don’t mix.) And then call your representative because your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can usually cover the damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2homethefts\">2. Home thefts</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/understanding-the-reality-of-holiday-related-crimes-49947\">reports</a> from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), robberies and personal larceny increase by about 20 percent during the holiday season. While this statistic focuses on the December holidays, it all starts with Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>Thieves know that you’re buying presents and may have more cash on hand. Plus, people are away from their homes more during the holidays, and that gives criminals ample opportunity to break in or swipe packages off of porches.</p>\n<p>You can protect yourself in a few different ways, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting a security system.</strong> This not only deters criminals, but it may earn you a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discount on your homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Using lights with timers.</strong> You can give the impression that you’re home pretty easily with today’s smart technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Canceling your mail.</strong> If you go away, even for a weekend, halt mail service or ask a friend to pick up your deliveries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is burglarized, your homeowners insurance may be able to provide coverage for what was stolen, including items that were in your car away from your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3foodpoisoning\">3. Food poisoning</h2>\n<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/index.html\">48 million people</a> get sick from foodborne pathogens every year. And with the number of amateur chefs making full-blown feasts, Thanksgiving may be the national championship of food poisoning.</p>\n<p>The most likely culprit of this Thanksgiving disaster is probably undercooked turkey. It can easily spread bacteria through much of your Thanksgiving dinner if you’re not careful about cross-contamination.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the CDC provides a host of food safety tips to keep your guests safe, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thaw your turkey safely and completely.</strong> Turkeys generally take 24 hours per pound to defrost, so buy your bird early. And never leave it on the counter. The safest way is in your refrigerator, but you can also defrost it in a leak-proof bag in a sink full of cold water as long as you change the water every 30 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Handle your turkey safely.</strong> You need to wash your hands thoroughly before handling raw turkey, and never let any utensil, cutting board, dish, or other surface that’s touched raw turkey come into contact with any other part of your meal, whether it’s cooked or not.</li>\n<li><strong>Cook your defrosted turkey completely.</strong> To kill any bacteria in your turkey, make sure that it is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. You can check this by putting a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of your turkey’s breast, wing, and thigh.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4kitchenfires\">4. Kitchen fires</h2>\n<p>Kitchen are busy places on Thanksgiving Day, and it shows in an increase for fire risk. US fire departments responded to approximately <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/snapshot_thanksgiving.pdf\">2,400 residential fires</a> on every Thanksgiving Day between 2014 and 2016. That’s more than double the average number of residential fires on all days.</p>\n<p>Protect your home and your loved ones by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watching where you set down towels and other flammable items.</li>\n<li>Never leaving food cooking on your stovetop unattended.</li>\n<li>Keeping a lid near your stove as you cook so you can put out a fire.</li>\n<li>Asking someone to keep children and pets out of the kitchen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fire in your home can be absolutely devastating, but your homeowners insurance can help you recover. Once you pay your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>, your insurer helps pay to repair damaged parts of the kitchen and replace destroyed items like pans and appliances. And if you have to temporarily relocate, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> can help with additional living expenses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5animalliabilityincidents\">5. Animal liability incidents</h2>\n<p>Of course, your furry friend is a total sweetheart! But sometimes our pets’ behavior can be unpredictable. The increase in guests and busy scenarios that normally accompany the holidays can often trigger unexpected reactions. In fact, dog bites are likely more common than you think - according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/dog-bite-prevention\">more than 4.5 million people</a> are bitten by dogs each year.</p>\n<p>To help keep your pet and your guests safe, work on socializing and training them before the big day. During the celebrations, make sure you know where they are at all times and monitor their body language so you can remove them from any stressful situations. And before any gatherings, make sure to check that your policy includes <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability coverage</a> in case the unexpected does happen!</p>\n<h2 id=\"6cloggeddrainsandsewerbackups\">6. Clogged drains and sewer backups</h2>\n<p>You may know the rules in your own home, but do your guests? Maybe they’re used to having a garbage disposal when you don’t have one, or maybe they think it’s ok to put a little grease down their drains sometimes. They might even occasionally flush things in the toilet that belong in the garbage can.</p>\n<p>While a small drain mishap could make for a funny Thanksgiving story later, a big clog or backup could be a major headache. Luckily, if one of your guests makes a costly mistake, your home insurance may cover the damage with a <a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">water backup endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7guestinjuries\">7. Guest injuries</h2>\n<p>Burns from turkey fryer fires aren’t the only injury risk at your gathering. Guests could slip on frosty walkways outside, trip over loose rugs, or they might even just tip over after a little too much wining and dining.</p>\n<p>We know you’ll keep an eye on your loved ones to try to prevent any disasters, but accidents happen! Your home insurance can likely help pay the costs of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical expenses</a> like ambulance rides and emergency room visits if someone gets hurt during the celebration.</p>\n<p>With a little forethought and planning, you can avoid most Thanksgiving disasters. But if something bad does happen, your homeowners insurance policy may be able to help.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in November 2021.

    body: "<p>No one likes to think about getting sued, but accidents happen all the time. And when they happen around your home, you could be liable for them.</p>\n<p>That’s why home insurance offers liability protection. It can help pay for legal bills and settlement costs that might otherwise drain your bank account (and then some) when someone is hurt on or because of your property.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some common situations your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability insurance</a> may cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1whenthedogbites\">1. When the dog bites</h2>\n<p>We know – your beloved pup wouldn’t hurt a fly! At most, your fur baby might lick someone into submission.</p>\n<p>But if the day ever comes that Sparky defends your honor with his teeth, your liability coverage can typically cover the bitten person’s medical bills so long as your policy has <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a>. (In some cases, you may need to add this coverage through an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> or possibly buy a separate policy.) If the injured person sues you over the dog bite, your liability insurance may cover the legal bills, too.</p>\n<p>According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/dog-bite-prevention#:\">4.5 million people</a> suffer dog bites every year! And when you consider that the payout for a dog bite averages about <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/press-release/triple-i-us-home-insurers-paid-out-nearly-900m-in-dog-related-claims-in-2021-041222\">$49,025 per claim</a>, you see just how useful personal liability coverage can be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2whenyouhaveaswimmingpool\">2. When you have a swimming pool</h2>\n<p>As fun as pools are, they’re also what insurance companies call an “<a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisance</a>.” This is because swimming pools can tempt people – especially young people – into acting in an unsafe way. The result? Pools are often a big liability exposure for homeowners.</p>\n<p>But check your policy. Some <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">homeowners insurance covers swimming pools</a>, but others don’t. Moreover, some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> only cover liability for pool injuries if your negligence was not a factor in the incident. In other words, you may be required to gate and lock the entrance to your pool and keep it well maintained in order for your coverage to protect you. Some insurers will not protect your pool liability if you have a slide or diving board.</p>\n<p>Ask your representative about how your coverage applies to your pool to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3whenyourkidhitsahomerunthroughtheneighborswindow\">3. When your kid hits a home run … through the neighbor’s window</h2>\n<p>This is perhaps the only time you’ll regret your kid’s cannon of an arm, but if a baseball shatters your neighbor’s window, your liability insurance can usually help pay for repairs.</p>\n<p>In fact, personal liability insurance can cover many situations where you inadvertently cause damage to your neighbor’s property. For example, the personal liability protection in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> typically covers if a fire spreads from your house to your neighbor’s. It can also protect you if a neighbor sues because your tree fell on their fence – assuming you’ve taken good care of that tree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4whenyourguesttakesaspill\">4. When your guest takes a spill</h2>\n<p>If your guest falls down the stairs because your handrail wasn’t properly installed, your liability insurance can typically help pay for their medical expenses, shielding you from the cost. That may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surgical expenses</li>\n<li>Dental work</li>\n<li>Ambulance ride</li>\n<li>ER costs</li>\n<li>X-rays</li>\n<li>Professional nursing services</li>\n<li>Prosthetic devices</li>\n<li>Funeral services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you aren’t covered in all cases. If you were playing around and accidentally pushed your friend down the stairs? Your coverage usually won’t help you out because the situation was avoidable.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Your personal liability insurance usually covers damage to your guest’s property. So if a visitor to your home ends up suing after their phone is destroyed by your toddler, you may be able to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evenpersonalliabilityinsurancehasitslimitations\">Even personal liability insurance has its limitations</h2>\n<p>As awesome as liability insurance is, it has limitations. Not every claim that arises on your property is a covered claim. When something isn’t covered, you will have to pay for damages on your own. This is why you want to ensure that your property is safe and accessible in all the right ways. For example, your liability coverage doesn’t apply to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tenants and their injuries.</li>\n<li>Injuries caused by your car (that’s a job for your car insurance).</li>\n<li>Dog bites from <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breeds</a> (unless your policy covers these types of dogs!).</li>\n<li>Injuries that could have been avoided.</li>\n<li>Your own injuries or injuries residents of the home experience (that’s what health insurance is for).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about your liability coverage, just ask us! We’ll be happy to explain what it can and can’t cover.</p>"

    body: "<p>People say a cluttered house and a cluttered mind go hand in hand in hand. That’s an uncomfortable place to be, but it likely describes many homeowners – and explains why home organization is such big business. But hiring someone to organize our homes is expensive. And <em>The Home Edit</em> only gives us eight episodes to binge each season.</p>\n<p>Most of us need to find ways to organize our homes and lives for ourselves. The end of the year, with its goal setting and retrospection, seems the best time to do just that.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, getting organized doesn’t have to be a complicated process. By taking just a few simple steps in your home, you can save yourself time, expense, and headaches later on. Here are four easy home organization tips to help you stay on top of your to-do list as we head into the new year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1addimportanthomerelateddatestoyourcalendar\">1. Add important home-related dates to your calendar.</h2>\n<p>Keeping a calendar is a great way to stay on top of your to-do list. And if you track home-related tasks on that calendar, you can better manage finances and maintenance.</p>\n<p>Make sure your calendar includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scheduled mortgage, insurance, property tax, and utility payments.</li>\n<li>Importance maintenance tasks. (Use our handy <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance checklist</a> to get started.)</li>\n<li>Upcoming <a href=\"/do-you-need-an-inspection-for-homeowners-insurance/\">inspections</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consult last year’s household files or simply work your way through the months of the year to find important dates. Then add each of these dates to your calendar.</p>\n<p>You may also want to consider adding reminder dates a few weeks in advance so you have ample time to prepare.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2createappliancereferencefolders\">2. Create appliance reference folders.</h2>\n<p>Ever find yourself searching high and low for appliance receipts and manuals only to come up empty-handed? Simplify your search by creating appliance reference folders for major appliances, such as refrigerators, stoves, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, and freezers.</p>\n<p>Start by taking <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> that lists all your major appliances and household systems for which you have documentation. Then create physical file folders or digital folders that will help you find information quickly and keep things updated easily. Store important appliance related information in these folders, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchase receipts.</li>\n<li>Warranty information.</li>\n<li>Serial numbers.</li>\n<li>Instruction manuals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Added bonus:</strong> If these items are damaged and you need to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">make a claim</a>, this handy reference folder offers the information you need quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3createahomestoragechart\">3. Create a home storage chart.</h2>\n<p>The point of getting organized is knowing where things are so you can find them when you need them – so why organize things unless you record where they’re packed away? Create a home storage chart that identifies storage locations for seasonal items and you won’t scramble to find stored stuff again.</p>\n<p>No more searching for <a href=\"/blog/holiday-decor-ideas/\">holiday decorations</a> or hunting down your stowed summer clothes. The next time you want to wrap gifts or turn over your wardrobe, you’ll know right where to go.</p>\n<p>You can create your storage chart using pen and paper, a word processor, or spreadsheet. Once you’ve created your chart, be sure to store it in an easy-to-access spot – like a desk drawer or the inside of a kitchen cabinet – so you can refer to it throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4reininyourpaperwork\">4. Rein in your paperwork.</h2>\n<p>If you’re like many homeowners, you may have important documents stored throughout the house. But you know they’re important and you may need them one day.</p>\n<p>Do yourself a big favor and sort these files now. Start simple and separate them into these categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homeownership documents (your deed, titles, closing paperwork, mortgage information, etc.)</li>\n<li>Tax information (W2s, 1099s, proof of health insurance, and receipts for deductible expenses)</li>\n<li>Other financial information (pay stubs, retirement statements, investments, etc.)</li>\n<li>Insurance policies (<a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, car insurance, health insurance, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For extra credit, scan these documents and so you can sort and store them digitally. That way if your physical files are destroyed, you have digital backups on hand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheauthor\">About the Author</h3>\n<p>Rashelle Isip is a New York City-based professional organizer, blogger, and author.

    body: "<p>Buying a home is a big deal, so people usually have a lot of questions before they make an offer. They worry about affording the mortgage, and wonder if it’s near good schools. They look for a place that’s close to work and has all the rooms and space they need. And they want to know if the house is in good shape or if they’re going to have to get a new roof in a couple of years.</p>\n<p>All of these are smart questions to ask when buying a home, but there’s one more factor to consider: climate change. Our changing climate is causing stronger hurricanes, increased flooding, and more extreme temperatures, yet a recent survey showed that <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-insurance-protect-against-extreme-164904980.html\">48 percent of new homeowners</a> don’t think about that before they buy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homebuyersignoreclimatechangedespitenaturaldisasterconcerns\">Homebuyers Ignore Climate Change Despite Natural Disaster Concerns</h2>\n<p>There appears to be a pretty big disconnect between the concerns homebuyers have and the actions they take when choosing where to live. While nearly half say climate change isn’t a factor in their decisions, the <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/is-your-home-insurance-ready-for-extreme-weather/\">Realtor.com survey</a> also discovered that significant portions do have concerns about natural disasters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>39 percent worry about tornadoes.</li>\n<li>38 percent worry about floods.</li>\n<li>29 percent worry about hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s not just this survey that's sounding an alarm. In an interview with CNBC, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman claimed <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/homebuyers-not-worried-about-climate-change-redfin-ceo.html\">homebuyers aren’t taking climate change seriously</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem with this, as Kelman pointed out, is that buyers “keep marching into the jaws of destruction,” even if their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> doesn’t cover the havoc that ensues. Plus, as more people move into high-risk areas, insurance companies have to cover more frequent and more expensive claims. This drives up premiums, sometimes to the extent that homeowners can’t find the coverage they need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretobuypropertywithclimatechangeinmind\">Where to Buy Property with Climate Change in Mind</h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">major report</a>, the climate is changing everywhere, so how can you decide where to buy property? You may want to start by identifying what areas of the country interest you and researching what experts have to say about the impact climate change may have on them.</p>\n<p>SafeHome.org compiled data from Climate Central and came up with a <a href=\"https://www.safehome.org/climate-change-statistics/\">Climate Change Rate Index</a> to evaluate states by five major risk categories and their effects: extreme heat, drought, wildfire, coastal flooding, and inland flooding. It found the five states with the lowest Climate Change Rate Index were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vermont (30).</li>\n<li>New Hampshire (63).</li>\n<li>Massachusetts (99).</li>\n<li>Minnesota (104) .</li>\n<li>Colorado (106).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the states with the highest risk are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida (308).</li>\n<li>South Carolina (282).</li>\n<li>Louisiana (281).</li>\n<li>North Carolina (276).</li>\n<li>Mississippi (270).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>States in the Northeast have the lowest risk, with an average Climate Rate Index of 123, followed by the Midwest (147) and West (166). The South, with an average Climate Change Index of 226, has the greatest risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsuranceforpropertieswithclimaterisk\">Home Insurance for Properties with Climate Risk</h2>\n<p>Once you have an idea of how climate change may impact the area where you want to buy property, you can identify the specific risks you’re most likely to face and determine if homeowners insurance covers your potential catastrophes.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how home insurance covers some of the more common natural disasters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wind damage, including that from tornadoes, is typically covered.</strong> However, if you live in a hurricane-prone area you may have a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> on top of your standard deductible. Some insurance companies also add a <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a> in certain areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Water damage is usually only covered if it’s caused by a sudden, internal accident, like a burst pipe, or occurs because of damage caused by another</strong> <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\"><strong>covered peril</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Flooding from storm surge, overflowing rivers and streams, and other external sources almost always requires <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. Flood insurance may also be required if you live in a high-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildfires are being excluded by more and more insurers,</strong> so you may find it hard to get home insurance if you’re in a known <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire zone</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Snow and ice damage is often covered,</strong> but you may see your claim denied if you allow snow or ice to build up, and it causes water to seep into your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Areas such as Utah can get both severe winter blizzards and seasonal thunderstorms that produce significant flooding. The Midwest has seen serious flooding in both 2019 and 2020, and large swaths of California, Colorado, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas all saw <a href=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn\">wildfires in 2021</a>.</p>\n<p>When you find a home you want to buy, ask the real estate agent about climate change and natural disasters common in the area. Will rising ocean levels pose a problem to your land? What drainage features exist to prevent flooding with significant rainfall? Do you have to be concerned about hurricane season each year? If so, in what ways?</p>\n<h2 id=\"isclimatechangeadealbreakertobuyingahome\">Is Climate Change a Deal Breaker to Buying a Home?</h2>\n<p>Knowing the facts about <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change and how it might affect a new property</a> doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. But you do need to be fully aware of the risks you face so you can make an educated decision.</p>\n<p>There are many things you can do to reduce the potential effects of climate change disasters on your new home. Arm yourself with the data so that you can research mitigation options for your property. In the end, you may still feel it’s worth the risk to buy a dream home, but at least you’ll be prepared for the worst case scenario.</p>"

    body: "<p>To celebrate Black History Month, we built a list of Black interior designers who are shaping modern home trends and making history as we speak. Find out what inspires these influential designers and the trademarks of their unique styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1chanaerichards\">1. Chanae Richards</h2>\n<p>Prior to opening <a href=\"https://www.olorointeriors.com/\">ọlọrọ interiors</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/olorointeriors/\">@olorointeriors</a>), Chanae Richards had no idea she even wanted to be in design. Her degree was in public financial management, but curating a friend’s gallery ignited her interest in design, and her success in the project drove her to make a business of her new-found passion.</p>\n<p>Richards does not share photos of the work she does for clients. She describes her own style as minimalist, but don’t mistake that for boring. Her goal is to bring richness to minimalism, and she does so with bold colors, striking patterns, and strong lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2leydenlewis\">2. Leyden Lewis</h2>\n<p>Brooklyn-born Leyden Lewis is the founder and creative director of <a href=\"https://www.leydenlewis.com/\">Leyden Lewis Design Studio</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/leydenlewisdesignstudio\">@leydenlewisdesignstudio</a>). He’s also a trained architect and artist, but his list of accomplishments doesn’t end there. Leyden Lewis Design Studio made Elle Decor’s list of 125 top interior designers in 2019 and 2020 and Architectural Digest’s AD100 in 2021. Add to that the titles of educator, art consultant, and founding member of the <a href=\"https://www.badguild.info/\">Black Artists and Designers Guild</a>, and you can see why Lewis is so influential.</p>\n<p>Lewis’ background in fine arts is evident in his design aesthetic, where he weaves contemporary artwork and sculptural pieces to create meaningful spaces for his clients. Ultimately, he combines his expertise in each discipline in dramatic yet functional design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3nicolegibbons\">3. Nicole Gibbons</h2>\n<p>“Approachable sophistication” is perhaps the best way to describe Nicole Gibbons’ (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicolegibbonsstyle\">@nicolegibbonsstyle</a>) design style. Her work combines classic lines and neutral tones with rich pops of color for a light atmosphere with a modern edge.</p>\n<p>Gibbons has taken the fun, collaborative attitude of her full-service design firm <a href=\"http://www.nicolegibbonsstyle.com/\">Nicole Gibbons Style</a> to several other endeavors, including her lifestyle blog and modern paint brand Clare. When Gibbons isn’t working as an interior designer, she’s sharing tips and trends on top media outlets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4jeaninehaysbryanmason\">4. Jeanine Hays &amp; Bryan Mason</h2>\n<p>Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason on the husband-and-wife team behind <a href=\"https://www.aphrochic.com/\">AphroChic</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aphrochic\">@aphrochic</a> ), a blog-turned-brand that marries modern design with history and global culture. The couple’s interests span several creative fields, including interior design, fashion, and content creation, and in 2019, they launched AphroChic magazine to bring all of these onto one platform.</p>\n<p>As interior designers, Hays and Mason work to tell a story through a neutral palette highlighted with colorful accent pieces, antiques, and global artifacts while maintaining a modern aesthetic. In addition to being named one of New York’s top interior design firms, AphroChic styled the first ever African American concept house on the west coast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5carmeonhamilton\">5. Carmeon Hamilton</h2>\n<p>Carmeon Hamilton (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carmeonhamilton\">@carmeonhamilton</a>) is known for several achievements. Not only is she a top interior designer, content creator, blogger, public speaker, and merchandise consultant, Hamilton won HGTV’s “Design Star: Next Gen” and currently hosts the network’s “Reno My Rental.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton describes herself as a modern bohemian, a concept that shines through in her work as the creative lead of <a href=\"https://www.carmeonhamilton.com/nubiinteriors\">Nubi Interiors</a>. By laying muted colors, bold patterns, and earthy textiles, she creates designs that evoke a sense of serenity and wellbeing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6tiffanybrooks\">6. Tiffany Brooks</h2>\n<p>Tiffany Brooks (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiffanybrooksinteriors/\">@tiffanybrooksinteriors</a>) is a passionate designer based in the suburbs of Chicago. She founded her firm <a href=\"https://www.tiffanybrooksinteriors.com/\">Tiffany Brooks Interiors</a> in 2007 with the mission to create stunning living environments that encompass clients’ individual needs and unique styles.</p>\n<p>Since launching, her work has been featured in Architectural Digest, HGTV Magazine, Essence, Domino, Forbes and elsewhere. She is also the host and designer of HGTV’s Smart Home, and in 2013 she was named the winner of competition show HGTV Design Star.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7brigetteromanek\">7.

    body: "<p>For some homeowners, a well-maintained lawn is just as important as a white picket fence and two-car garage. But for all the joyful moments that patch of grass may bring, it can cause just as many headaches. Traditional grass lawns take a lot of work, and much of that effort damages the environment through pesticides, fertilizer, and wasted water.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are plenty of grass alternatives that look beautiful, are easy to maintain, and minimize your impact on our planet. We investigated alternatives to lawns and came up with seven options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1ornamentalgrass\">1. Ornamental Grass</h2>\n<p>Drought-resistant and incredibly low-maintenance ornamental grasses, like New Zealand flax or Mexican feather grass, are ideal for homeowners who want to feel like their home sits in a beautiful field. There are several varieties, some of which can grow up to 15 feet tall, so you want to research what works best for your zone.</p>\n<p>Once planted, ornamentals don't need to be mowed and almost never require fertilizer. The one downside is that you can’t really walk on. That means you either need to keep your yard off limits or build a path through it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2moss\">2. Moss</h2>\n<p>Moss may be the perfect option if your yard doesn’t get a lot of sun. It’s already a drought-resistant plant, and with the right amount of shade, moss doesn’t need watering. Moreover, moss is resilient and can handle some foot traffic, making it more like a traditional yard. These characteristics make moss a good choice for areas where severe drought conditions occur regularly.</p>\n<p>You can choose from dozens of moss varieties, and most never grow higher than one inch. That eliminates the need for mowing. Even better, moss is one of the few grass alternatives that is super easy to install.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3groundcover\">3. Ground Cover</h2>\n<p>Ground cover is a term that describes plants, often perennials, that creep along the ground but don’t grow in height. Because they stay low to the ground and grow with a minimal amount of effort, most are excellent to use as an alternative to a lawn. Common examples of plants used a ground cover include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clover.</li>\n<li>Hosta.</li>\n<li>Creeping myrtle.</li>\n<li>Wild violet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ground cover often has other benefits. For example, flowering ground cover can attract pollinators. Again, ground cover describes several types of plants, so be sure to research what’s appropriate for your zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4flowerandshrubbeds\">4. Flower and Shrub Beds</h2>\n<p>You most likely wouldn’t replace all of your grass with flower and shrub beds, but using them in your yard reduces the amount of space dedicated to a traditional lawn. The other big benefit here is curb appeal. Brightly colored flowers and shrubs of various heights can add visual interest that people find attractive.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that the degree of maintenance required depends on the types of flowers and shrubs you plant. You could be watering just as much as you would a lawn unless you try your hand at <a href=\"/blog/sustainable-gardening-ideas/\">sustainable gardening</a>. For example, choosing native perennials usually means you need less water and fertilizer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5nograssalternatives\">5. No-Grass Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Some homeowners have found that the best grass alternative is no lawn at all. In many cases, this means adding simple hardscaping that can <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">boost your curb appeal</a>, like a :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Path out of gravel or stone.</li>\n<li>Rock garden.</li>\n<li>Retaining wall.</li>\n<li>Patio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But some forgo grass altogether, opting instead for yards filled with gravel or sand. Another option that may work if you’re looking for something with absolutely no maintenance is artificial turf. Once you install it, there’s no water, sun, or weeding required. The big downside to artificial turf is the cost, which can be anywhere from five dollars to $20 per square foot. However, artificial turf can last a long time, keeping its appeal for up to 25 years.</p>\n<p>A yard without any grass isn’t for everyone, but the idea is becoming more popular in areas where drought makes it difficult to keep a lawn looking healthy. Artificial turf, rocks, and other nonliving grass alternatives are great options in many areas of the country.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that no one is asking you to give up your yard completely. Simply adding one or more of these grass alternatives can make your lawn easier to maintain while you also help out Mother Nature. One note of caution before you make the switch: your homeowners association may have rules about your yard, so check with it first!</p>"

    body: "<p>From pumpkin carving to crowds of ghosts and goblins descending upon your street, Halloween is fun for all ages. But the tendency toward mischief can mean extra risk for homeowners. Protect your home and family from trouble (and <a href=\"/blog/halloween-home-insurance-claims/\">halloween insurance claims</a>!) with these seven Halloween safety tips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1guardagainstvandalism\">1. Guard Against Vandalism</h2>\n<p>Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you may actually get tricked if you don’t hand out treats. And while a smashed jack-o’-lantern is annoying, it’s nothing compared to the damage some vandals can do on Halloween night. Protect against these nighttime mischief-makers by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping your porch lights on.</li>\n<li>Taping over your mailbox.</li>\n<li>Parking your car in the garage.</li>\n<li>Sitting outside during trick-or-treat hours.</li>\n<li>Installing motion sensor lights and cameras.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a bonus, a well-lit home and walkway reduces the chance of injuries for trick-or-treaters and visitors you actually want to stop by on All Hallow's Eve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2placepumpkinsproperly\">2. Place Pumpkins Properly</h2>\n<p>Jack-o’-lanterns make great decorations, but they can tip over easily and cause a fire, so you want to be smart about where you put them. Setting candle-lit pumpkins along your walkway when you expect kids in costume to come by is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n<p>The safer bet is to use glow sticks or flameless candles, and make sure you clear the area of debris so there’s less flammable material around. Or better yet, keep the lit jack-o’-lanterns inside your home. Either way, never leave a lit pumpkin unattended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keeppartygoerssafe\">3. Keep Partygoers Safe</h2>\n<p>For the over-21 crowd, Halloween night rivals only New Year’s Eve and St. Patrick’s Day as an occasion to imbibe. But having friends over for a few libations can actually turn into a lawsuit for the homeowner. Not only can you be held responsible for a friend’s injury if they’ve been over-served, but in some states, you can be held liable for your inebriated partygoer’s actions beyond your house.</p>\n<p>You can minimize this trouble by having hearty appetizers on hand and offering nonalcoholic drinks. Another tip: refrain from drinking yourself. You’ll have a better shot at keeping someone who’s had too much from getting hurt.</p>\n<p>It's also important to consider food allergies when hosting or handing out candy. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/foodallergies/index.htm\">most serious allergic reactions</a> in the United States are caused by milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts. About <a href=\"https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-impact-of-peanut-allergies\">2.5 percent of all children in the US</a> are allergic to peanuts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4payattentiontocostumesafety\">4. Pay Attention to Costume Safety</h2>\n<p>Dressing up is a big part of Halloween fun, so don’t let the good times be marred by a costume that puts you or your little ones at risk. Pick a costume that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fits well.</strong> Baggy or oversized costumes are a tripping hazard.</li>\n<li><strong>Doesn’t limit vision or restrict breathing.</strong> Make sure you try on masks so you know if you can see and breathe well.</li>\n<li><strong>Is flame retardant or resistant.</strong> A store-bought costume should have this phrase clearly stated on the label. Otherwise, consider clothing that is polyester or nylon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you can’t find a flame-resistant costume, you may want to try this do-it-yourself solution to increase your safety:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine seven ounces of Borax with three ounces of boric acid in two quarts of warm water.</li>\n<li>Dip your costume in the mixture until it is fully saturated and wring out by hand.</li>\n<li>Hang to dry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mixture <strong>does not</strong> make your costume fireproof, just fire retardant (i.e., slow to burn when exposed to flame). It also only lasts until the fabric is washed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5takecareoffido\">5. Take Care of Fido</h2>\n<p>Trick-or-treaters may bring you all kinds of joy, but your dog might not love it when the doorbell rings fifty times in one night. The onslaught of visitors can make your furry friend anxious, so make sure they’re locked up safe and sound throughout All Hallow’s Eve to minimize the chance of Fido making a break for it while you’re handing out candy. Doing so can also keep tiny hands safe from fear-driven bites and you safe from a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"/blog/halloween-safety-tips-covid-19/\">COVID put the kibosh on last year’s festivities</a>, 2022 is the year for people to go out and enjoy again﹘assuming, of course, your local health department has given its okay. These Halloween safety tips can help everyone have a good time.</p>\n<p>Be safe out there, goblins!</p>"

    body: "<p>Most homeowners don’t think much about the shape of their roof. After all, as long as it looks good and doesn’t leak, everything should be fine, right?</p>\n<p>The truth is your roof shape affects <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">your home’s ability to withstand high winds</a> and other natural hazards that may be common in your area. In fact, you’ll often see more of a certain type of roof shape in a particular area because of the climate. Gable roofs, for example, are more common in rainy climates because the steep pitch prevents water from getting in the house.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the following roof shapes to understand how yours might affect you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gable\">Gable</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/gable-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Gable roofs are one of the most common types of roof shapes you’ll find on a home, in part because they have a simple design and are affordable to build. They have two sloping sides that meet at the top ridge to form a triangle. Essentially, the house with a gable roof has two walls that are rectangular and two walls that are triangular to meet the pitch.</p>\n<p>These are additional styles of gable roofs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>False-front gable roof:</strong> This type of roof uses one or more gables to give the appearance of a gabled roof, typically to improve curb appeal by extending the roof line above the actual shallow-pitched roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-gable roof:</strong> A roof is called cross-gabled when it has two or more gable roof lines that intersect. The ridges typically run perpendicular to each other to form an L- or T-shaped roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Shed roof:</strong> Instead of two sections meeting at a point to form a triangle, a shed roof, also called a skillion, slants in one direction. Think of it as a high back wall with a steep pitch coming forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Gable with curves:</strong> Adding curved elements to a gable roof, like eyebrow dormers, create softer lines in the overall look of the house. However, doing this means you can’t use metal roofing that comes in panels. Shingles in most materials should work fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A gable roof’s pitch means it’s a pretty good choice for rainy climates because the slop helps the house shed water. Unfortunately, they aren’t great in hurricanes. In a significant storm, gable roofs are more susceptible to wind damage than other types of roofs, so having one can affect your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hip\">Hip</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/hip-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A hip roof is similar to a gable roof except that the hip roof has four sides that slant downwards. This makes for an interesting look, plus there are no valleys where leaves can collect, which helps with maintenance.</p>\n<p>Hips roofs are sturdy and wind resistant, so you often see them in areas where there are frequent storms. Because the roof is four-sided, wind pressure is spread evenly throughout the perimeter of the roof, unlike a gable, which concentrates wind pressure in its topmost point.</p>\n<p>However, you should note that hip roofs cost more to build than a gable roof and home prices will reflect that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gambrel\">Gambrel</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/gambrel-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Though technically a type of gable roof, these deserve their own mention. Also called a barn roof, gambrel roofs have two different slopes and are often used in Dutch Colonial and Georgian <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">style homes</a>. The top sloping section is usually less steep than the bottom sloping section to maximize living space under the roof. Gambrel roofs also have narrow eaves that are heavily slanted.</p>\n<p>Because of their open shape, gambrel roofs aren’t ideal for homes in high-wind regions. Like gable roofs, high winds can get leverage under the roof and force it upward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flat\">Flat</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/flat-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As its name suggests, a flat roof is, well, flat. These roofs have nearly no pitch, which allows for extra living space, like a rooftop garden. However, the lack of pitch also makes these roofs susceptible to damage from heavy rainfall or the weight of ice and snow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mansard\">Mansard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mansard-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>From the ground, a mansard roof looks like a lot like a hip roof with four steeply sloping side. However, it actually has another section that has a gentler pitch at the top. This is a common feature in French-styled homes. The low-pitched top section makes mansard roofs a good option in areas that get a lot of snow.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a house, you definitely want to pay attention to the available roof shapes and look for one that provides both style and the appropriate protection. And if you’re already a homeowner, you can check out some <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">additional tips for making your home more wind resistant</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Experiencing a flood is devastating for homeowners. Not only is the damage expensive and extensive, but floodwaters can make an area dangerous.</p>\n<p>How can you ensure your family is safe to return home after a flood? These five pointers can help you build a plan of action to get repairs underway and get back on your feet after a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Please remember:</strong> Don’t return to your home if the evacuation order is still in effect. Wait until authorities give the all-clear before you head back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1figureoutifyoureinadisasterarea\">1. Figure out if you’re in a disaster area</h2>\n<p>If your region is considered a disaster area, you will have access to more resources to help accelerate your hazard-free move in. These may include financial services, <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA), and public services to help shoulder the cost of flood repairs and cleanup.</p>\n<p>FEMA has several <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual/program\">programs for individuals and households</a> that can help you recover from a flood. For example, you may be able to get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funds for temporary housing.</li>\n<li>A temporary housing unit.</li>\n<li>Money to help you repair or replace your home and personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Hazard mitigation assistance to make your home stronger and more durable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get more information by calling FEMA at 800-621-3362.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2waitfortheallclear\">2. Wait for the all clear</h2>\n<p>You need to wait for the authorities to give you an all clear before you return to your home. That will tell you the imminent danger of the flood is gone and you can safely return to your home.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that cracks in your foundation can cause gas leaks and other issues. As a precaution, have your gas supplier shut off the gas until the property has been investigated for leaks. Your water supplier can also let you know when the water is safe to consume again.</p>\n<p>Anything that plugs into an electrical outlet needs to be inspected, thoroughly cleaned, and dried by an electrician before you try to use it. This can prevent electronics shorts and possible electrocution from damaged items. If you are unsure how high the water rose, err on the side of safety before using any electronics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3contactyourinsurancecompany\">3. Contact your insurance company</h2>\n<p>You must have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> in place before your home experiences a flood to draw on your coverage. This protection is the difference between resuming your life as quickly as possible and struggling to make the expensive repairs needed to make your home habitable again.</p>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> does not provide flood coverage. Most insurers sell this coverage as a separate policy (Kin adds flood insurance as an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your homeowners policy). If you have <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a>, consider getting this coverage as soon as possible. Don’t wait until after a flood has occurred – your coverage can’t retroactively cover flood damage.</p>\n<p>Payouts for severe damage can take up to six months, so it’s best to call your insurance company as soon as you know you will need to make a flood claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4surveythewaterdamage\">4. Survey the water damage</h2>\n<p>Whatever you do, don’t wade or swim through standing water. If your home has standing water, make accommodations to stay elsewhere until the home is drained and accessible.</p>\n<p>Once the home is safe to survey, assess the damage. Some common issues to look for after a home is flooded include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A cracked foundation.</li>\n<li>Jammed windows and doors.</li>\n<li>Soaked insulation.</li>\n<li>Weak drywall.</li>\n<li>Wrecked electrical systems.</li>\n<li>Ruined appliances and furniture.</li>\n<li>Moldy carpets.</li>\n<li>Warped wooden floors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these issues may be hard to spot on your own, such as the foundation and insulation. However, take note of the problems you can easily spot without putting yourself in harm’s way. Stay away from the electric (you’ll want to leave that to a professional), but do note which outlets were underwater – they will need to be replaced.</p>\n<p>There are things you can do to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prevent-mold-after-a-flood/\">prevent mold after a flood</a>. However, if you encounter black mold, document it and call a professional to get it removed right away.</p>\n<p>Also be aware that infestations are common after a flood (like snakes – yikes!). Wear rubber gloves and boots while you survey the damage and keep an eye out for unwelcome critters.</p>\n<p>Lastly, ensure water coming from your faucets is not toxic. Your utility company can confirm when the water is safe again. Until then, boil water before drinking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5documentthedamage\">5. Document the damage</h2>\n<p>Before you start repairs, document the damage that has been done to your home. Take pictures or use video to document what will need to be replaced. This will help you make the case for maximum coverage for your lost items.</p>\n<p>During a crisis, it’s important to have a plan to avoid further danger or losses. Make sure good insurance coverage is part of that plan. Be sure to go over your recovery plan with your family so they know what to expect after a disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in August 2018.

    body: "<p>Your home’s foundation does more than hold your house above ground – it can also keep out moisture, resist earth movement, and help insulate the home. It’s called a foundation for a reason – it’s the most important structural component of the home! Different types of foundations for homes may serve different purposes, and knowing which yours has may be helpful when you apply for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore the different types of foundations and how you can identify which your home has.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1concreteslabfoundation\">1. Concrete Slab Foundation</h2>\n<p>Concrete slabs are one of the most common and most cost-effective types of foundation for homes. Builders clear and level the ground, and then pour anywhere from four to eight inches of concrete and install drainage pipes and steel rods to reinforce the foundation. This prevents the concrete from cracking later on. The structure is then built directly on the concrete slab.</p>\n<p>You know if you have a concrete slab foundation because there is no space between the cement and the floor. This type of foundation is also fairly low, so you need good drainage to prevent flooding. That said, concrete slab foundations are good for preventing mold and pests because there’s no air between the home and the foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2crawlspacefoundation\">2. Crawlspace Foundation</h2>\n<p>A crawlspace foundation is commonly used where the soil is difficult to dig. It raises the home upon concrete pillars that provide just enough space for someone to crawl under the house﹘usually four feet or less. This is how homeowners get to their plumbing or electrical components. Homes on crawl space foundations are less likely to see significant damage in areas where the groundwater is high. By lifting the living area of a home above the waterline, the owner can save on costly repairs or avoid making <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">home insurance claims</a>.</p>\n<p>A homeowner can usually tell that they have a crawlspace foundation if they have several steps leading to their front door. A quick look under the house also reveals the pillars the structure sits on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3elevatedpierspilingsfoundation\">3. Elevated Piers/Pilings Foundation</h2>\n<p>Similar to a crawl space, a piers or pilings foundation raises a home up, but as the name suggests, it uses piers or pilings to do it. Builders drive the pilings into the ground and place pile caps, typically made of concrete, across several pilings so that the weight of the structure is distributed among them.</p>\n<p>This type of foundation is commonly used where putting in other foundations isn’t possible, like the side of a hill where digging uniform sections is difficult or coastal areas where the soil shifts. They’re a durable way to secure a home and prevent flood damage because everything is elevated. Workers also have an easy time accessing home systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4basementfoundation\">4. Basement Foundation</h2>\n<p>Basement foundations are built by digging down about eight feet and either pouring concrete or laying bricks or concrete blocks. The space typically matches the footprint of the home and can be used for storage or made into additional living space. In fact, you can tell you have a basement because you can easily maneuver around it, walking freely under your house.</p>\n<p>Aside from storage and additional living space, most builders also put the electrical, plumbing, and heating systems in the basement. Basements help keep a home cooler during warm weather by providing a place for air to flow. However, basements are more expensive than other foundations and require maintenance to prevent moisture, structural deterioration, and mold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5elevatedwithenclosurefoundation\">5. Elevated-with-Enclosure Foundation</h2>\n<p>An elevated-with-enclosure foundation raises a home above ground level and leaves an area of usable space. A good example is a home built over the garage or workshop. The space under the home is enclosed, may have a separate entrance than from the main home, and is often not a livable area. Additionally, the foundation may have flood openings.</p>\n<p>This is a good foundation type for areas that work with the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> and have a <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevation</a>. If water levels rise, the main living area is typically protected from damage.</p>\n<p>Before you apply for home insurance, take a quick look at your foundation. The more accurate you are when answering questions about the type of foundation your home has, the more accurate your quote will be.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforaflood\">How to prepare for a flood</h2>\n<p>Thanks to its coastline that won’t quit, Florida is the nation’s capital of flooding. And floods are the most expensive natural disaster in the US, according to FEMA. So if you own a home in Florida, it’s in your best interest to make sure you’re protected from the potentially costly effects of flooding and water damage.</p>\n<p>Here are six steps you can take to reduce your risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1figureoutyourfloodplainandriskofflooding\">1. Figure out your floodplain and risk of flooding</h2>\n<p>FEMA has mapped the entire country and graded it according to its risk of flooding. You can enter your address to get your flood designation using <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">this search tool</a> and then read about <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-zones\">what each flood zone means</a>.</p>\n<p>Briefly, if your zone designation starts with an A or a V, you’ve got a decently high risk of flooding. Zones B and shaded X have moderate flood risk, and zones C and unshaded X have the lowest risk (trust us, this will make sense when you use that tool).</p>\n<p>Based on your area’s designation, you can find out something called the <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">“base flood elevation</a>” (BFE), which, for practical purposes, means how high water is likely to rise in the event of a major flood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2movewatersensitiveequipmentabovethebfe\">2. Move water-sensitive equipment above the BFE</h2>\n<p>Once you know how high floodwater is likely to rise, you can take steps to protect the things most likely to be damaged by water. This includes everything from TVs and computers to your air conditioner and backup generator, which may need to be elevated on and secured to a concrete block. You might also want to check your electrical outlets and switches. These should all be at least one foot above flood level.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to elevate an entire home using piers or pillars, but doing so is usually cost-prohibitive. Alternatives might include installing water vents to let water flow more easily through your home (rather than rising inside) or sealing external walls to help prevent water from getting in. That said, new buildings in communities that participate in the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> and have a BFE are required to meet some of these specifications based on their flood risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3updateyourvalves\">3. Update your valves</h2>\n<p>Even if a storm doesn’t drop enough water to flood your home, it can still cause damage if it causes your sewer to back up and flow into your house. To prevent this, have a plumber install a backflow or gate valve on every sewage pipe that connects to your home. These valves are designed to keep water flowing in the right direction – out.</p>\n<p>FEMA estimates that installation can cost between $600 and $1,400, a pretty reasonable price given that a single inch of flooding can cause nearly $27,000 of damage to your home and possessions (or more!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"4keepyourpropertyingoodrepair\">4. Keep your property in good repair</h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever experienced a leaky roof, you know how small problems can lead to big damage when water’s involved. To minimize the odds of water damage (in any weather), be sure to take care of essential maintenance tasks on and around your property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear your gutters.</strong> Make sure they’re hung securely from your roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your rain spouts.</strong> Make sure they’re positioned so that water will drain away from your and your neighbors’ houses.</li>\n<li><strong>Repair your roof as needed.</strong> A new roof may cost several thousand dollars, but it can also prevent tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of water damage. Even better: some homeowners insurance companies may offer lower premiums if you have a new roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Repair sidewalks and driveways.</strong> Crumbling infrastructure around your house could cause water to pool around it. Make sure out-of-date concrete and asphalt aren’t creating a direct channel to your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5uselandscapingtoreducedamage\">5. Use landscaping to reduce damage</h2>\n<p>Whether your yard floods from a sudden accident or a stretch of bad weather, the water can easily end up leaching through your foundation and into your basement. Luckily, landscapers have a number of methods for minimizing this risk, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sloping your yard away from your home.</strong> This entails finding the high and low points on your property and adding dirt so water flows away from your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Using mulch in gardens.</strong> Mulch soaks up rainwater and keeps soil in place. Just be sure to leave a space between the mulch and your home to prevent rotting.</li>\n<li><strong>Going easy on the mowing.</strong> Grass roots absorb water and help reduce flooding, but cutting your grass too short weakens them.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding drainage to your driveway.</strong> Paved driveways can’t absorb rainwater like your yard can, so giving water a place to go is important here. A channel or trench drain is an inexpensive choice for getting this done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"6lookintowetfloodproofing\">6. Look into wet floodproofing</h2>\n<p>Most of the tips on this list are about dry floodproofing ﹘ essentially, keeping water out of your house. But you can also try wet floodproofing that actually allows water into enclosed spaces. Wet floodproofing creates a balance between the water on the inside and outside of your home, and that reduces the likelihood of cracks (or worse) in your foundation.</p>\n<p>Sounds wild, right? But common wet-floodproofing methods like foundation vents and sump pumps are pretty well known.</p>\n<p>If you go this route, however, you should note a couple of important caveats. First, wet floodproofing should only be used in non-livable areas, like crawl spaces. The expense of cleaning and repairing livable areas makes wet floodproofing a poor option. And speaking of cleaning, note that wet floodproofing does nothing to mitigate other flood risks, like damage from flowing water or flood borne debris and contaminants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7contactyourcounty\">7. Contact your county</h2>\n<p>If you’ve noticed standing water on the sidewalks or streets around your home after even small storms, you and your neighbors could be at higher risk for flooding. Luckily, many counties pay particular attention to water management. Get in touch with yours (check for the water services or planning department) to ask for action on improving drainage near you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8knowwhattododuringaflood\">8. Know what to do during a flood</h2>\n<p>While it’s important to prepare your home for a possibility of flooding, it’s just as crucial to know what to do once waters are rising. If a flood is imminent, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place sandbags to block floodwaters.</li>\n<li>Move valuables and electronics to higher floors or up on counters.</li>\n<li>Shut off your electricity.</li>\n<li>Secure heavy appliances or furniture that might cause damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"9reviewyourhomeownersinsurance\">9. Review your homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>Standard homeowners insurance policies don’t cover all types of water damage. Typically, your policy will include coverage for water damage that originates inside the house, like a dishwasher leaking and ruining your floors.</p>\n<p>The basic policy excludes coverage for floods that come from outside – so pretty much anything storm-related. If you’re not sure what your insurance covers, now’s a good time to check with your agent.</p>\n<p>If you’re in a high-risk flood zone, you’ll probably need flood insurance (in some parts of the country, you can’t get a mortgage without it).</p>\n<p>Regardless, you may be able to get a better rate on your insurance by following the measures we outlined here because some insurance companies reward risk mitigation with lower prices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodriskisincreasingprettymucheverywhere\">Flood risk is increasing pretty much everywhere</h2>\n<p>The more severe storms we’ve seen in recent years are the new normal, thanks to climate change. And a new study predicts that 40 percent of Florida properties will be “<a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/underwater-analysis-full-report.pdf\">highly exposed</a>” to flooding by 2045. In other words: the time to manage your flood risk is now, while you still have an opportunity to save your home.</p>"

    body: "<p>Looking for the perfect Halloween adventure? Take a trip to some of the eeriest abandoned towns in the Sunshine State. These Florida ghost towns are filled with history and intrigue – and probably a few spirits, too. Enter if you dare!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1anonainpinellascounty\">1. Anona in Pinellas County</h2>\n<p>While the town established by Captain John Thomas Lowe disappeared into nearby Largo, you can still visit several remaining structures. These include a still-active church and the cemetery where many of its original settlers are buried.</p>\n<p>A short drive takes you to Heritage Village where you can tour the <a href=\"http://www.pinellascounty.org/Heritage/lowe_house.htm\">Lowe House</a>, a classic example of a homestead house. This simple and efficient <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">type of home</a> was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century and can usually be identified by its gabled roof and batten siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2slaviainseminolecounty\">2. Slavia in Seminole County</h2>\n<p>Slavia was established by Slovakian immigrants who banded together to purchase the plot of land and move their children away from the temptations found in large cities. The hard work of turning wet woodlands into successful farms drove many of the new settlers aways, but those who stayed were able to create the community they sought.</p>\n<p>Today, no residents live in Slavia, but you can visit its oldest remaining building: St. Luke’s Lutheran Church. Built in 1912, the church building was originally a worker shack. This structure has been renovated several times and still sits at the edge of Slavia’s cemetery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3zioninpalmbeachcounty\">3. Zion in Palm Beach County</h2>\n<p>Zion is probably best known for being the site of one Florida’s Houses of Refuge. Beginning in 1870, these houses were essentially life-saving stations for sailors shipwrecked along Florida’s mainly barren eastern coast. Zion’s Orange Grove House of Refuge #3 was in service for 20 years. The government rented the building to new settlers until 1927 when the structure was destroyed in a fire.</p>\n<p>Zion may also be one of the few Florida ghost towns with the potential for actual ghost sightings. Orange Grove House of Refuge #3 is also where <a href=\"https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/13412\">barefoot mailman</a> James “Ed” Hamilton stayed the night before he disappeared near the Hillsboro Inlet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4holopawinosceolacounty\">4. Holopaw in Osceola County</h2>\n<p>In 1928, JM Griffin Lumber Company bought a plot of land near the Florida East Coast Railway Kissimmee Valley extension and opened a sawmill. Next came housing, which the company leased to its employees and ultimately became the town of Holopaw, a Creek word that means “walkway” or “pavement.”</p>\n<p>The town thrived with the lumber industry, hitting a population of 2,000 at its peak. But then the timber ran out, the railroad discontinued service, and Holopaw dwindled into a ghost town. It’s remained that way since the Great Depression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5olympiainmartincounty\">5. Olympia in Martin County</h2>\n<p>Olympia may be the only Florida city that has never been anything but a ghost town. It was the grand idea of a banker who hoped to build a Greek-inspired second Hollywood during Florida’s real estate boom of the 1920s.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his timing was terrible. The boom went bust just a few years after architect Maurice Fatio began working on the project, followed by a hurricane in 1928. The remnants of this Florida ghost town are mainly found in streets named for Greek and Roman gods throughout Old Hobe Sound.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6fortdadeinhillsboroughcounty\">6. Fort Dade in Hillsborough County</h2>\n<p>Fort Dade was built in 1899 on Egmont Key to defend the Tampa Bay area during the Spanish-American War. But even before that, the stretch of land was home to a lighthouse, a series of military outposts, and an internment camp for Seminole prisoners. The city had over 300 residents at one time, plus a hospital, jail, bowling alley, and more. Now people can explore four abandoned fort structures by taking a ferry or boat to Egmont Key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7okeelantainpalmbeachcounty\">7. Okeelanta in Palm Beach County</h2>\n<p>Okeelanta was founded in 1913 with the intention of converting Everglades into usable farmlands. After some initial struggle farming in wetlands, the original settlers were successful with a variety of crops, including sugarcane, corn, beans, and tomatoes, and the town grew.</p>\n<p>However, Okeelanta’s 200 residents routinely battled floods and freezes, and the town’s population began to move away. Okeelanta was ultimately destroyed in 1928 by a hurricane. City founder Thomas Will attempted to rebuild but failed to get financing and Okeelanta ultimately disappeared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8kerrcityinmarioncounty\">8. Kerr City in Marion County</h2>\n<p>Kerr City was founded in 1884 as a stage coach stop for travelers commuting from the St. Johns River to Ocala. The town had 100 people at one point, as well as a hotel, general store, drug store, school, church, and post office.</p>\n<p>After the Great Freeze killed all the citrus plants in 1894 and 1895, most people moved away. The hotel burned down in 1907, while the post office operated until 1941 and is still standing. Many of the old homes have been renovated in recent years and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, the town is fenced off and visits by the general public aren’t allowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9hopewellinhillsboroughcounty\">9. Hopewell in Hillsborough County</h2>\n<p>Hopewell (originally named Callsville) was founded as a plantation shortly before the Civil War. When the slaves were freed, the plantation was divided into smaller homesteads. Eventually, the town was abandoned - but no one seems to know why.</p>\n<p>Now it’s surrounded by citrus groves and the only buildings that remain are the church and cemetery, McDonald House, and the Hull House. Most of the town’s buildings have been overtaken by trees and vines, but some of the homes are still in decent shape for curious visitors.</p>\n<p>Were these abandoned places a little too tame for your taste?

    body: "<p><strong>“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” — Arthur Conan Doyle, <em>The Sign of Four</em></strong></p>\n<p>You shouldn’t have to be a super sleuth known for deductive reasoning to discover what your home insurance covers. But with all the conflicting information out there, how else can you tell fact from fiction?</p>\n<p>Put on your deerstalker hat and Inverness cape – the game’s afoot! Join us as we bust the seven most common home insurance myths and uncover the truth once and for all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth1homeownersinsuranceisrequiredbylaw\">Myth 1: Homeowners Insurance Is Required by Law</h2>\n<p>Having <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is important, but it isn’t required by state or federal law, despite what many people think. That said, you may still be required to get a policy if you have a <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>. Most lenders require home insurance because they have a financial interest in the property and want to protect it. If something were to happen to the home, they want to make sure that it gets repaired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth2homeownersinsurancecoversflood\">Myth 2: Homeowners Insurance Covers Flood</h2>\n<p>Home insurance policies typically exclude flood damage, but it’s easy to see why so many homeowners assume it’s covered. Most have been told their policy includes water damage, and what is a flood if not a whole lot of water? But in insurance, “<a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a>” generally means damage caused by water originating in your house, like a broken freezer or a burst pipe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is an expensive myth to fall for. When you consider how common and expensive flood damage is, <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood insurance is really for everyone</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth3anythingthatisstoleniscovered\">Myth 3: Anything That Is Stolen Is Covered</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance does cover stolen items, but there are limits to how much coverage is available. The first limit is how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> you decide to carry, which is usually between 20 to 50 percent of their dwelling coverage. So let’s say your policy ends up with $20,000 in personal property coverage. If a burglary at your home ends up costing more than $20,000, the difference won’t be covered.</p>\n<p>But there may be other limits on your personal property coverage, and that’s for certain high-end items. Many insurance companies have additional limits for particularly expensive property, such as jewelry, furs, rugs, and artwork, and those limits are often not enough to cover the loss. For example, you might only have $1,500 of coverage for fine jewelry, so you would be underinsured if you had any valuable jewelry.</p>\n<p>The solution is to increase the limits available in your homeowners policy when you have big-ticket belongings. You can do that with a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth4theonlywaytopaylessistogetlesscoverage\">Myth 4: The Only Way to Pay Less Is to Get Less Coverage</h2>\n<p>Most people assume that skimping on coverage is the only way to save money on your home insurance. That’s probably because many of the factors used to determine your premium are beyond your control, such as your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">Replacement cost estimate</a>.</li>\n<li>Location.</li>\n<li>Age.</li>\n<li>Size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you may find that many insurance companies offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>, especially to responsible homeowners. Another option is to increase your deductible. This increases your costs if you file a claim, but insurance companies typically reward this with a lower premium.</p>\n<p>If push comes to shove, however, you may want to shop around for a new insurance company. Granted, most insurers consider similar factors when setting your premium, but they can weigh them differently. Or perhaps just <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote</a> from us. We base your premium on <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">thousands of data points</a> to get a better understanding of the risk you present and a more accurate premium to cover it. Homeowners usually save money when they switch to us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth5selfinsuringismoreaffordablethaninsurance\">Myth 5: Self Insuring Is More Affordable Than Insurance</h2>\n<p>Self-insurance simply means that rather than buying a home insurance policy from a company, you decide to save enough money to pay for any damages you experience. That choice might be tempting if you’re particularly handy or work in construction. But while you may have no problem making small repairs, you might not be able to cover the costs of rebuilding your entire house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth6youmustinsureyourhomeforitsmarketvalue\">Myth 6: You Must Insure Your Home for Its Market Value</h2>\n<p>Believing in this myth may cost you quite a bit of money because it can lead you to pay for coverage you don’t actually need. The problem is that your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">market value and replacement value are seldom the same</a>. For example, a home you paid $500,000 might only cost $200,000 to rebuild. Insuring it for its current market value would result in too much home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth7homeinsurancecoverspestinfestations\">Myth 7: Home Insurance Covers Pest Infestations</h2>\n<p>Home insurance typically does not cover damage caused by termites, mice, bats, and other vermin. The issue for the insurance company is that infestations develop over time, so it expects you to deal with pests before they can damage your home. Essentially, dealing with rodents is part of regular home maintenance, and insurance companies don’t pay for damage caused by neglect or <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">normal wear and tear</a>.</p>\n<p>Regular upkeep on your home may seem daunting, but it’s an essential part of protecting your investments.

    body: "<p>The pandemic forced many of us to stay home more than we usually would, and the interior design trends of 2021 reflect that. People want to create comfortable living spaces that also incorporate the realities of their new work-from-home lifestyle, according to many of the experts we asked. Here are seven of their interior design tips for staying on trend this year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1japandi\">1. Japandi</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/japandi.jpg\" alt=\"A japandi-style kitchen with wooden cabinets and island and muted tones\" /></p>\n<p>Japandi combines a Japanese esthetic with Scandinavian coziness and functionality.</p>\n<p>Because many of us are still working and living in one space, minimalist designs will stay popular, according to Tom Lawrence-Levy of <a href=\"http://naturalasthetik.com/about\">Natural Astehtik</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naturalasthetik/\">@naturalasthetik</a>): “I really feel like in 2021 we'll continue seeing a lot of wabi-sabi and Japandi (Japanese-Scandinavian fusion) influence.”</p>\n<p>Japandi style combines Japanese minimalism with Scandinavian functionality, and tends to be warm and comforting. This means a design focus on natural elements﹘think lot of woods and muted color palettes﹘and cozy comfort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2cheerfulcolors\">2. Cheerful Colors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/colorful-home.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a living room with a bright yellow wall\" /></p>\n<p>Adding a pop of color, like the bright yellow wall in this living room, can lift your mood.</p>\n<p>You likely won’t see people opting to do a modern kitchen in all gray right now. People are looking to brighten their moods by using color in the spaces they spend the most time.</p>\n<p>“Colors indeed make us feel happy and positive. Recently, we are seeing more cheerful hues dominating the home,” says Emily Perez of <a href=\"https://kitcheninfinity.com/\">Kitchen Infinity</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kitchen_infinity/\">@kitchen_infinity</a>). “Combinations of …yellow and gray and shades of blue and green are also trending in a big way.” Luckily, adding a fresh coat of paint is an easy and <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">inexpensive way to redecorate your home</a> and take part in this interior design trend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3lightandbreezyfabrics\">3. Light and Breezy Fabrics</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/curtains-living-room.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with pale gray transparent curtains, a velvet gray couch, and bright velvet throw pillows\" /></p>\n<p>The light curtains in the living room pair compliment the velvet of the couch.</p>\n<p>What your skin touches and your eyes see can greatly affect your mood. This is where fabric comes into play for design trends this year. According to Andra DelMonico of <a href=\"https://trendey.com/\">Trendey</a>, “Because people are spending more time at home, they are paying closer attention to the fabrics and materials in their homes. Popular fabrics in 2021 are those that are light and breezy.”</p>\n<p>Ideally, fabrics should have texture but still be soft to the touch. Even better, the texture should be visible and incorporate natural elements such as floral patterns. DelMonico says the goal is to create “visual interest in the room while adding a feeling of coziness.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"4maximalism\">4. Maximalism</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/maximalist-design.jpg\" alt=\"A a maximalist living room with multiple colored rugs, striped curtains, and several wall hangings\" /></p>\n<p>Maximalism embraces more of everything, including colors and patterns.</p>\n<p>Andre Kazimierski of <a href=\"https://www.improovy.com/\">Improovy</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/improovyit/\">@improovyit</a>) says he’s seeing minimalist designs being converted into maximalist designs. “Maximalism is seen through having a lot of decor, colorful paint, and an overall unique design.” He believes that minimalism popularity was driven by influencer trends but now people are “looking for ways to express their individualism and creativity.”</p>\n<p>One way to embrace maximalism and still have your room look organized is to pick just a few colors to use for emphasis. Repeat these colors throughout your space to create cohesion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5mixandmatchkitchens\">5. Mix-and-Match Kitchens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mixed-metal-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"A kitchen with stainless steel appliances and gold metal light fixtures\" /></p>\n<p>This kitchen mixes stainless steel appliances with gold light fixtures.</p>\n<p>Adam Graham of <a href=\"http://fixr.com/\">Fixr.com</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fixr_com/\">@fixr_com</a>) tells us, “There is a move away from installing only stainless steel, but instead having different metal appliances and finishes, such as a sunset bronze refrigerator for a cost of anywhere between $1,000 and $12,000, mixed with different finishes for sinks, faucets, cabinet hardware, and lighting fixtures.” This combined with new, vibrant color schemes on your walls gives your kitchen a complete, modern overhaul.</p>\n<p>However, much like with maximalism, you risk a sense of disorganization if you mix and match too much. Your better option is to pick a main finish and add one or two complementary ones as accents.You could try this by keeping your big-ticket appliances, like your refrigerator and stove, but switching out your cabinet hardware. That’s just one of <a href=\"/blog/easy-home-projects/\">several easy DIY projects</a> you can do when stuck at home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6vintage70slook\">6. Vintage 70s Look</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/retro-living-room.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with retro leather chairs, wood paneled floors, and colorful mod vases\" /></p>\n<p>Design elements from the 1970s are great in small doses.</p>\n<p>While you might not normally seek out an avocado green refrigerator, don’t rule out the color schemes and styles of the 1970s. Mark Cutler and Nichole Schulze of Cutler Schulze believe there are a lot of reasons the 70's are making a comeback.</p>\n<p>The biggest factor is “ongoing supply chain issues” that make it difficult for people to buy new. This has people “turning to local sources like vintage stores and swap meets to redecorate.” The vintage 70s look is a great way to add character to your home, mixing a bit of the old with a bit of the new (such as appliances).</p>\n<h2 id=\"7timelessdesignselements\">7. Timeless Designs Elements</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/timeless-design.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with a black wall, black couch, and bold pink, textured accent rug and throw pillow\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless design elements help make your home your own.</p>\n<p>Many of us are seeing less value in following the latest trends and more value in making a home reflect who we are. “Timeless design elements encompass statements of personal identity,” according to Amanda Eirich of <a href=\"https://www.bfr.com/\">Brook Furniture Rental</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bfr_brookfurniturerental/\">@bfr_brookfurniturerental</a>). “It's always appropriate to curate your home with the items that you are drawn to and love.”</p>\n<p>Eirich emphasizes that it’s okay to experiment until you find something you love. Play with lighting to improve your mood and freshen up a room. Look for centerpieces that mean something to you, like a dining room table that invites people to sit and talk. It’s all about finding pieces that speak to you that won’t lose their appeal when the next trend comes around.</p>"

    body: "<p>Plumbing is probably something you only think about when something goes wrong, but it’s actually one of the most important systems in your home. In fact, it’s so important that the types of plumbing pipes you choose can have a dramatic impact on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s right, the type of plumbing pipes in your home could actually mean some insurance companies won’t offer you a homeowners policy. Here’s what you need to know about the plumbing pipes that you find in your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1pex\">1. PEX</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-if-pipes-pex.jpg\" alt=\"PEX pipes attached to the basement ceiling of a home, angled view\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Flexible PEX pipe can weave throughout walls, ceilings, and crawl spaces.</small></i><p></p>\n<p>PEX is a type of plumbing pipe that is made of cross-linked polyethylene. This material makes it strong enough to handle water pressure while also being flexible so installation is easy. You can even form 90-degree curves with it. Unfortunately, it’s not part of building codes in all U.S. cities and counties, so you should check with a building inspector prior to installing PEX.</p>\n<p>Where it is allowed, PEX costs up to $2 per foot, making it a cost-effective solution to replace copper or galvanized steel. Some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> may hesitate to offer coverage to a home with PEX plumbing, particularly where the building codes do not allow it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2pvc\">2. PVC</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-pvc.jpg\" alt=\"Image shows a plumber's hands installing white PVC pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>PVC pipe is inexpensive and easy to use but should be installed by professionals.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes are used as drain or vent lines. Builders like it because it’s lighter and less cumbersome than working with steel or copper, but homeowners like it for the price. PVC pipes cost about $1 per foot, and a small home with five to 10 fixtures typically costs about $1,800 to fit. Joints are glued together which makes a well-installed system a good option; however,</p>\n<p>Like PEX, PVC is not approved for home use in all states. You’ll want to check with a contractor to determine the viability of using it in your home. Plus, installing PVC pipe is probably not a DIY-kind of job because poor installation can lead to leaks in critical areas. Most insurance companies don’t have an issue with PVC pipes, but it’s important to have a professional install them or you may have frequent leaks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3copper\">3. Copper</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-copper.jpg\" alt=\"A closeup of thin copper pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Copper pipes are high quality, but their rigidity can make them difficult to work with.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Copper is the most expensive type of plumbing pipe available. It costs at least $4 per foot, and repiping a home with copper can cost up to $20,000. But many homeowners prefer copper pipes because they don’t come with the health concerns that some other pipes may have ﹘ an important quality for water intake lines.</p>\n<p>Plumbers also like the quality of copper pipe but concede that it is difficult to work with. Because it is so rigid, working it throughout a house can be problematic. You have to cut copper pipes with a hacksaw or specialized copper tube cutter, and then solder the joints together. This requires experienced tradespeople. However, insurance companies almost always have a preference for copper because it lasts long and traditionally has fewer risks for leaks when installed properly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4abs\">4. ABS</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-abs.jpg\" alt=\"Stacks of black ABS pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Like PVC, ABS pipes may not be allowed in your town.</small><i></p></p>\n<p>Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe has a lot of similarities to PVC pipe. They look alike, both used as drain and vent pipes, and cost just about the same. And as with PVC and PEX pipes, ABS is a type of plumbing pipe that is not permitted in all cities and counties, so you need to check local building codes before installing it.</p>\n<p>That said, ABS is black and slightly softer than PVC pipe. It's also stronger and handles cold temperatures well ﹘ although it can warp in higher temps. More importantly, ABS pipes are hardened using bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical that may cause negative side effects on fetuses, infants, children, and animals. Insurance companies typically insure homes with ABS pipes where the pipes are included in building codes. However, some may be concerned about the possibility of leaks forming in certain climates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5flexibleconnectors\">5. Flexible Connectors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-flex.jpg\" alt=\"Two silver flexible connectors on a white background\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Flexible connector pipes are usually small, connecting appliances to the water supply in a wall.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Flex connectors are used for linking appliances to the main intake lines throughout your house. For example, you can usually find them connecting your ice maker, dishwasher, or water heater to the main kitchen line.</p>\n<p>Flex pipes cost more than other types of plumbing pipes, but they’re useful, even necessary, in small areas that require a pipe of an unusual shape. Homeowners can get frustrated with flex pipes as they are thin and prone to cracking, which also means they should be checked periodically. Using flexible connections most likely won’t hurt your home insurance rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6galvanizedsteelandcastironpipes\">6. Galvanized Steel and Cast Iron Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-galvanized-steel.jpg\" alt=\"A bundle of galvanized steel pipes in a warehouse yard\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Galvanized steel pipe sometimes carries gas, but it should never be used for water supply.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>You may see galvanized steel pipe in older homes, but it’s much less common now. It fell out of favor because the zinc coating and pipe can corrode, resulting in a build up of lead that may end up in your water. Moreover, galvanized steel pipes connect by screwing threaded ends together or into connecting fittings. This makes the pipes difficult to install.</p>\n<p>Cast iron pipes are more common than galvanized steel and are often used for sewer and drainage purposes. Like galvanized steel, cast iron pipes are difficult to install, but in this case, that’s because the pipes are heavy and hard to cut. Cast iron also rusts, which can lead to significant leaking problems if not properly maintained. Insurance companies may insure a home with galvanized steel or cast iron pipes, but the risk they pose for water damage could mean a higher premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7leadpipes\">7. Lead Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-lead.jpg\" alt=\"Red water valve on an old lead pipe\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Lead pipe, while uncommon, may still be in homes built before 1986.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Homes built prior to 1986 may have lead pipes that have not been replaced. That’s a big problem because lead plumbing systems can cause serious health problems. In fact, the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all new plumbing materials be lead-free. If your home still has lead plumbing, insurance companies, including Kin, are unlikely going to offer you a policy until your plumbing is replaced with safer materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8polybutylenepipes\">8. Polybutylene Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/type-of-pipe-polybutylene.jpg\" alt=\"Man manual cuts off a piece of pplastic pipe for installation water line\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Polybutylene pipes tend to fail, so most home insurance companies won’t insure them.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Polybutylene pipes are made from a type of plastic resin and were commonly installed in homes from 1978 through 1995. They are no longer used because the disinfectants used to clean public water supplies cause microfractures in polybutylene. As a result, polybutylene pipes have a tendency to become brittle and fail, which can lead to extensive damage costing thousands in repairs.</p>\n<p>Like most insurance companies, we won’t offer homeowners policies if your home still has polybutylene pipes. During your <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>, you want to look for polybutylene pipes. They’re typically gray or white and have a dull finish rather than a shiny one.</p>"

    body: "<p>Homeowners insurance has a reputation for being complex. And historically, it has been. Usually it's full of legalese that's incredibly hard to parse. It's little wonder so many folks are in the dark about what their insurance actually covers.</p>\n<p>In fact, a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-insurance-protect-against-extreme-164904980.html\">recent study from Realtor.com</a> found that only 56 percent of homeowners know what to look for when buying a policy. Ouch.</p>\n<p>But that's where we can help. Let's recap the nine most common homeowners insurance mistakes so you can better understand your coverage and avoid confusion when it's time to file a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake1assumingfloodsarecovered\">Mistake #1: Assuming Floods Are Covered</h2>\n<p>Home insurance typically covers water damage related to something like a burst pipe, but it seldom pays claims for water coming into your house from an external source. This means storm surge during a hurricane is usually excluded, as is water damage from flash flooding, broken levies, and broken sump pumps.</p>\n<p>Long story short, <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">most people need flood insurance</a>. You can usually add our <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance endorsement</a> to your policy for as little as $175 per year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake2failingtocompareoffers\">Mistake #2: Failing to Compare Offers</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance premiums can fluctuate from company to company. In fact, one insurance company may be too expensive one year, but affordable the next, so you want to compare rates when you shop for coverage.</p>\n<p>As you shop, make sure you compare apples to apples. Price is important, but you only know if you’re getting a deal if you also check the coverage amounts and <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> or add-ons. Otherwise, you may pick the lowest premium only to find out that you’re one of the <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">64 percent of homeowners who are underinsured</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake3insuringyourhomeformarketvaluenotreplacementvalue\">Mistake #3: Insuring Your Home for Market Value, Not Replacement Value</h2>\n<p>Confusing your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">fair market value and its replacement cost</a> is one of the most common homeowners insurance mistakes. The limits on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> should be the amount it would take to rebuild your home, not what someone would pay to buy it. A home’s market value can be higher or lower than its replacement cost, so it’s not an accurate reflection of what your insurance company needs to make you whole after a loss.</p>\n<p>Your insurance representative can explain how your insurer calculates dwelling value. Most companies use a similar formula that looks at your home’s square footage, building materials, and other features as well as the construction costs based on your location. Understanding this calculation can help insure your home for the proper value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake4choosingtoohighofadeductible\">Mistake #4: Choosing Too High of a Deductible</h2>\n<p>You can save money on your home insurance if you choose a higher <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. This increases your responsibility in a claim, and that ultimately saves the insurance company money. However, you want to be cautious if you go this route. Raising your deductible reduces your premium, but you also have to come up with that amount if you have a claim.</p>\n<p>Before committing to a deductible, do the math on how much savings you’re really getting. At some point, the savings may not be worth it if you don’t have an emergency fund to pay for losses. One tip people use is to take the savings from a higher deductible and put that into an emergency fund to build that nest egg. But you have to be disciplined to do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake5notgettingsewerbackupcoverage\">Mistake #5: Not Getting Sewer Backup Coverage</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies automatically exclude losses resulting from a sewer backup. That’s right! Damage to your newly-renovated bathroom may not be covered if a flood causes sewer water to back up into your home. Luckily, most insurance companies offer an endorsement that covers this event for as little as $40 per year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake6underestimatingthevalueofpersonalbelongings\">Mistake #6: Underestimating the Value of Personal Belongings</h2>\n<p>People often grossly underestimate the value of the contents of their home; some even do it on purpose in hopes of saving on their insurance. But think about that might cost you in a total loss. When you add up the value of everything inside your home, from electronics to appliances, clothing, and home goods, you could be looking at more than $100,000 in stuff.</p>\n<p>One way to get a better handle on what your personal belongings are worth is to conduct a <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal-property-inventory-checklist.pdf\">home inventory</a> to properly record and categorize your stuff, and then store a copy away from your home so you can access it if there’s a catastrophe. You’ll be glad you have a complete list of lost items that includes serial numbers and receipts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake7keepingtheminimumliabilitycoverage\">Mistake #7: Keeping the Minimum Liability Coverage</h2>\n<p>The default <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">limit for liability coverage</a> in a homeowners insurance policy is usually $100,000, and that may be enough for some people. But others, like homeowners with an attractive nuisance or who host large parties, may have a greater risk of being sued and might want to consider increasing their liability coverage.</p>\n<p>There is no requirement or law that says how much coverage you need; it’s up to you to determine what’s appropriate for you. More importantly, increasing your liability coverage won’t dramatically increase your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake8forgettingtonotifyyourinsurerofmajorchanges\">Mistake #8: Forgetting to Notify Your Insurer of Major Changes</h2>\n<p>Certain changes in your home life merit a call to your insurance representative because they impact your coverage. For example, let your insurer know if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get married or ask someone to move in.</li>\n<li>Get a dog on a <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breed list</a>.</li>\n<li>Remodel your kitchen.</li>\n<li>Add a second bedroom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes like these can mean you need additional coverage, and if you don’t notify your insurance carrier you risk having a claim denied because the new detail wasn’t part of the original coverage. Don’t feel like you’re burdening your insurance agent with phone calls. They need to know and appreciate the heads up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake9thinkinghomeinsurancecoversmaintenanceissues\">Mistake #9: Thinking Home Insurance Covers Maintenance Issues</h2>\n<p>As a homeowner, you’re responsible for maintaining your home. That includes issues that might cause damage if you ignore them. like <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">getting a new roof</a> when necessary or <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">dealing with pests</a>. If you don’t take care of these kinds of problems, your insurance may deny a claim for any resulting damages.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say the railing on your staircase has rotted, and gives away when your neighbor grabs it. While your homeowners insurance usually covers a visitor’s injuries, it would most likely deny this claim because you failed to take care of the railing.</p>\n<p>Once you know the basics, getting homeowners insurance is pretty easy. All you have to do is answer a few simple questions and you can have your policy in just minutes. But if you still have questions, our representatives are also ready to help.</p>"

New windows can usually improve your home’s energy efficiency, increase safety for people with children and pets, and possibly even help with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> (check with your insurer).</p>\n<p>But the different types of windows have advantages and disadvantages to consider. We took a look at several window types and styles to help you figure out what makes sense for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1singlehungwindows\">1. Single-hung windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/single-hung-window.jpg\" alt=\"Single white window on teal house with window box full of flowers\" /></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever seen a child’s drawing of a home, then chances are you have an idea of what single-hung windows are. They’re the type of window that opens by raising the bottom panel, and they’re the most common windows on the market.</p>\n<p>Single-hung windows have fewer features than double-hung windows, so they cost less. They’re also easier to replace because they’re so common. However, you can only lift the bottom sash, and that limits the amount of ventilation they provide. The outside of single-hung windows can be difficult to clean, and slipping can become a problem over time.</p>\n<p>Cost: $250 to $600 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Difficult to clean exterior |\n| Easy to replace | Slipping can be a problem |\n|  | Limited ventilation |</p>\n<h2 id=\"2doublehungwindows\">2. Double-hung windows</h2>\n<p>Double-hung windows look a lot like their single-hung friends, but these windows open from both the top and bottom sashes. This makes them great for ventilation. Most also tilt, which makes cleaning them very easy.</p>\n<p>That extra feature, however, ends up increasing the price. And slipping can still be a problem if these windows are not properly maintained. That said, double-hung windows are a great space saver because they don’t protrude from the wall.</p>\n<p>Cost: $300 - $700</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Easy to clean | Difficult to clean exterior |\n| Great for ventilation | Slipping can be a problem |\n| Good for saving space | More expensive than single-hung |</p>\n<h2 id=\"3casementorcrankwindows\">3. Casement or crank windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/casement-window.jpg\" alt=\"Casement windows in a modern loft apartment\" /></p>\n<p>Casement windows sit on a hinge so you open them by turning a crank that swings the window out. This is easy to do and creates a good deal of airflow when opened. However, what’s easy for you to open may also be easy for a burglar. Moreover, the mechanical parts are subject to more wear and tear than some other types of windows.</p>\n<p>Cost: $300 to $750 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Great for ventilation | Easy to break in to |\n| Easy to open and close | Prone to wear and tear |\n| Weathertight seal | Expensive |</p>\n<h2 id=\"4picturewindows\">4. Picture windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/picture-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of modern home with picture window\" /></p>\n<p>Picture windows frame a view that you want to capture from inside your home. They let in a lot of light and can make the interior feel connected to the outside, all of which can make a great impression. However, picture windows are sealed in place, so they don’t help with ventilation, and they may also allow heat to escape even with their weathertight seals.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $400 to $800 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Unobstructed views | No ventilation |\n| Increased natural light | Not energy efficient |\n| Weathertight seal | Difficult to clean |</p>\n<h2 id=\"5slidingwindows\">5. Sliding windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/sliding-window.jpg\" alt=\"White wall with an open sliding window\" /></p>\n<p>Also called gliding windows or sliders, sliding windows are a lot like a double-hung window laid on its side. This makes sliding windows ideal for long, horizontal spaces. Even better, a tilting slicing window can also be easier to clean than other types of windows. They don’t require a crank so they’re more durable than casement windows, and they generally have better seals than double-hung windows. However, sliding windows are seldom available in wood, and people often complain about sticky sliders.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $400 to $900 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Low maintenance |\n| Some are easy to clean | Prone to sticking |\n| Energy efficient | Limited materials |</p>\n<h2 id=\"6awningwindows\">6. Awning windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/awning-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of a gray house with a close-up of an open, white awning window\" /></p>\n<p>An awning window is similar to a casement window except its hinges are at the top of the frame. When you turn the crank, the window frame swings open from the bottom. This makes awning windows good for security, but that narrow opening makes exiting in an emergency difficult. Additionally, cleaning the exterior isn’t easy, and the mechanical components can break.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $350 to $900 to install.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Prone to wear and tear |\n| Good for security | Difficult to clean |\n| Easy to open | Can be damaged if left open |</p>\n<h2 id=\"7baywindows\">7. Bay windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/bay-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of a red brick house with a white bay window\" /></p>\n<p>Bay windows usually consist of a series of flat windows that project from the side of your home and allow plenty of natural light to enter from multiple angles. The windows are grouped in a way that creates a shelf inside your home while also improving curb appeal.</p>\n<p>The amount of light they let in means bay windows probably aren’t the right choice for bedrooms, plus it can be hard to find window treatments for them. Moreover, bay windows don’t open and close, though some homeowners will use casement or double-hung windows on the side panels to improve airflow. Even without this addition, bay windows require professional installation, and that increases the cost.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $1,200 t0 $3,500</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Allow lots of natural light in | Expensive |\n| Increases interior square footage | Difficult to install |\n| Boosts curb appeal | Difficult to find window treatments |</p>\n<h2 id=\"8skylights\">8. Skylights</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/skylight-window.jpg\" alt=\"A white framed skylight looking out towards blue skies and a flowering tree\" /></p>\n<p>Skylights are windows that are installed into the roof to allow a maximum amount of natural light into a room. They’re particularly useful for lighting up a dark, interior room. You can choose skylights that are fixed, or one that’s vented that you can open to allow in fresh air. Placed in the right position, skylights can actually help keep your house warm.</p>\n<p>Skylights, however, are not cheap. They should be professionally installed, and you have to take good care of them. Leaky skylights can cause damage to your roof.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $900 to $2,150 per skylight.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Allows lots of natural light | Expensive |\n| Provides indirect solar heat | May result in leaks and roof damage |\n| Can help with ventilation | Difficult to clean inside and out |</p>\n<h2 id=\"9transomwindows\">9. Transom windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/transom-window.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional transom window with black ironwork\" /></p>\n<p>Transom windows that sit on top of interior and exterior doors and windows are mainly decorative elements, but they also let in additional natural light. Today, most transom windows don’t open and close, which means they can make rooms stuffy from radiant heat. The ones that do open allow air to flow through the home without opening all the doors and windows.</p>\n<p>Depending on the size and type, transom windows can be difficult to maintain and clean. Prices can also vary.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $200 to $600 per installed window.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Increases sunlight | Most limit airflow |\n| Inexpensive | May increase heat |\n| Stylish | Difficult to clean |</p>\n<p>One final note: Depending on where you live (We’re looking at you, South Florida!) you may need <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a> and <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a>.

That number has stayed more or less the same for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of good reasons someone might choose to age in place, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comfort.</strong> We all feel better being around things we are familiar with, and aging seniors often like the familiarity and memories that their homes provide.</li>\n<li><strong>Independence.</strong> Being able to contribute to society and maintaining a sense of autonomy can go a long way to preventing depression.</li>\n<li><strong>Pets.</strong> Sometimes assisted living facilities prohibit certain types of animals.

Only <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/community/info-2021/2021-home-community-preferences.html\">34% of older adults</a> realize they’ll need to make physical changes to their homes in order to remain in it as they age.</p>\n<p>Most homes require some modifications to make them safe for seniors. Here’s our list of aging in place remodeling tips to get you started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installsmarttechnologydevices\">Install smart technology devices</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-smart-tech.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Installing smart technology may make it easier for seniors to age in place.</em></p>\n<p>Smart technology may be one of the simplest ways to make aging in place a reality. Installing it in your home now means you can likely use your smartphone or virtual assistant to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn on the lights.</li>\n<li>Lock your doors.</li>\n<li>Raise and lower the temperature.</li>\n<li>Control appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even find <a href=\"/blog/smart-bathroom-technology/\">smart technology for your bathroom</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"makeyourbathroomsmoreaccessible\">Make your bathrooms more accessible</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-accessible-bathroom.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Zero-entry showers, handrails, and shower seats can minimize falls.</em></p>\n<p>Falls are a big concern for seniors, so many of our remodeling tips focus on minimizing your chances of falling. For example, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Convert your bathtub into a walk-in shower.</strong> This eliminates that first awkward step into a tub where you could easily lose your balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Add handrails or a grab bar.</strong> That way you have something to hold on if you do get wobbly.</li>\n<li><strong>Opt for a permanent shower seat.</strong> This can reduce your fall chances even further.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another area of concern in the bathroom is the floor. While no flooring is completely slip resistant, some do provide better protection from falls. Vinyl, natural stone, cork, and bamboo are all options to consider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"updateyourcountertops\">Update your countertops</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-rounded-counters.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Rounded countertops may reduce injuries for seniors aging in place.</em></p>\n<p>You may want to install kitchen and bathroom countertops with rounded corners if you plan on aging at home. Not only can an older person hit their head on a sharp corner in a fall, but they may suffer bruising if they bump into one. Another option might be to use a corner guard to soften edges.</p>\n<p>While you’re thinking about countertops, you might also want to consider getting some with multiple levels. A standard 36-inch counter could make up the majority of your workspace, but adding shorter levels would give you an option for sitting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thinkaboutmobilityaids\">Think about mobility aids</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-pull-out-shelf.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Pull-out shelves minimize can be a big help for seniors with limited mobility.</em></p>\n<p>As it gets harder to move about, many of us will end up using mobility aids, such as wheelchairs and walkers. Installing a ramp is the first step to making the home more accessible. Even if you don’t need a wheelchair, a ramp can be easier than climbing porch stairs.</p>\n<p>But there are likely other areas of your home that could use similar treatment. For example, take a look at your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bathroom.</strong> A roll-in shower eliminates the curb at your shower entrance, making it easier for someone in a wheelchair to get in.</li>\n<li><strong>Doorways</strong>. Door openings need to be at least 32 inches to give a wheelchair sufficient room. (Check the space allotted in your garage, too. You typically need five feet of space to get wheelchairs and other assistive devices out of cars.)</li>\n<li><strong>Cabinets.</strong> Pull-out shelves in lower cabinets and pull-down shelves in upper cabinets can make it easier for people with limited mobility to find what they need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"addachairlift\">Add a chair lift</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-chair-lift.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Chair lifts give seniors access to upper levels in their homes.</em></p>\n<p>Older people who live in multi-story buildings often put everything they need on the main floor of their home. That way, they minimize the amount of time they spend using the stairs and reduce their fall risk.</p>\n<p>However, that’s not possible in every home so another option is a chair lift. This gives you access to the upper levels of your home, while also protecting you from falls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjustlightswitchesandoutlets\">Adjust light switches and outlets</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aging-in-place-electrical-outlet.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Moving outlets can make them more accessible for seniors.</em></p>\n<p>You can hire an electrician to move light switches and outlets to a height that works for you. That may mean lowering switches so you can easily reach them from a seated position or raising electrical outlets so you don’t have to bend over to plug something in. Another good idea is to put electrical outlets on countertops or in backsplashes.</p>\n<p>One final tip: be sure to check your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> whenever you remodel. The changes you make may increase the value of your house, so you want to check that you have enough coverage when it’s time to renew.</p>"

    body: "<p>Before you put your house for rent on Airbnb, make sure your insurance covers it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airbnbhostscheckyourhomeownersinsurance\">Airbnb Hosts: Check Your Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>This week, news outlets <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/rental-nightmare-woman-claims-airbnb-guest-threw-party-caused-nearly-20k-in-damage\">reported</a> one of those Airbnb horror stories that make hosts cringe: a San Antonio woman rented her home to a single man, only to discover that he used it to throw a party for more than 200 college-aged guests – and cause nearly $20,000 worth of damage to the house in the process.</p>\n<p>It’s times like these where we often hear the same question from customers: does my homeowners insurance cover Airbnb activities?</p>\n<p>As with many questions in the world of insurance, the answer is “it depends.”</p>\n<p>But to be fair: in most cases, the answer is “No.”</p>\n<p>To help us understand why most homeowners policies won’t cover the kind of damage the San Antonio woman’s guests did at their party, we chatted with Michael Fitzgibbon, Chief Underwriting Officer at <a href=\"https://www.slice.is/\">Slice</a>, an on-demand insurance provider that offers coverage for home-share hosts. Here are some highlights.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whystandardhomeownersinsuranceisntenoughforairbnbhosts\">Why Standard Homeowners Insurance Isn’t Enough for Airbnb Hosts</h2>\n<p>One of the key points Fitzgibbon highlighted was that <a href=\"/blog/what-is-home-insurance-a-guide/\">homeowners insurance</a> is what’s called a “personal line.” As such, it has restrictions and exclusions for business activities – i.e., anything that makes the homeowner money. So if something goes wrong resulting from your money-making activity (i.e., hosting guests), your homeowners policy likely won’t offer coverage.</p>\n<p>But what about the insurance plans provided by the home-share platforms? Won’t that cover Airbnb hosts?</p>\n<p>Fitzgibbon’s answer: not so fast. Those plans are not actually “insurance.\"</p>\n<p>Apparently, platform-provided coverage may not be as robust as it sounds (and, let’s be honest, “$1 million in protection” does sound pretty robust). Take the example of the woman in San Antonio: one of her primary complaints in the news pieces we saw was that it was difficult to work with Airbnb.</p>\n<p>She apparently called them several times before they told her they’d need photographic evidence that there were more than 50 people at the residence. She also reportedly said that her primary homeowners insurance didn’t cover the party-related damage and it seemed her calls to Airbnb went ignored.</p>\n<p>Until, that is, the story got momentum in the media. Since the reports aired, it seems the platform has resolved her complaints.</p>\n<p>Phew.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whataboutselfinsuring\">What About Self-Insuring?</h2>\n<p>Another question we had for Fitzgibbon was this: if <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-my-home-insurance-policy/\">regular homeowners insurance</a> won’t cover Airbnb rentals and Airbnb’s Host Guarantee isn’t that dependable, can hosts opt to self-insure instead of buying additional coverage?</p>\n<p>When Fitzgibbon asked us what we meant by that, we said, essentially, saving up a big pot of money to use in case something went wrong. But he pointed out that true self-insurance would involve some kind of risk financing to fund future losses, which sounds complex and is complex.</p>\n<p>Setting aside a cash pile is one thing, but it’s not scientific and it’s also not practical for most people – if you’re renting on Airbnb, you’re probably doing that to increase the pile of cash you already have or create a pile of cash in the first place.</p>\n<p>So in summary: self-insurance for home sharing isn’t viable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sowhatinsurancedohomesharehostsneed\">So What Insurance Do Home-Share Hosts Need?</h2>\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all policy for home-share hosts, but Fitzgibbon mentioned a few characteristics to look out for when shopping for a policy to cover your Airbnb activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary coverage</strong>: This means that, in the event of a claim, it’s clear who has to pay (your primary insurer). It saves a lot of time and hassle when something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Liability coverage</strong>: This will protect you for the injuries that happen to guests, damages guests do to other people’s property, and other liabilities associated with your rental activities.</li>\n<li><strong>Fair rental value coverage</strong>: This provision in our landlord (DP3) policies can pay for lost rental income when a covered claim keeps you from renting your home or townhouse.</li>\n<li><strong>Business interruption coverage</strong>: This handy provision can provide you with income you would have earned from renting out your space, in the event that a covered property incident makes your house un-rentable for a period of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible coverage</strong>: Slice’s policies let you pay for coverage for when you need it rather than paying for a full year, in all cases, by default. This is a nice feature for many Airbnb hosts, who may use the platform only during specific seasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Worth noting: our <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> does cover homes and townhouses used for Airbnb and short-term rentals.</p>\n<p>Have a <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo you list on Airbnb</a>?

    body: "<p>Do you own a home, townhouse, or condo that you rent through Airbnb? That’s a great way to put your extra space to use and generate more income, especially if your place is in a destination-worthy location.</p>\n<p>The average Airbnb host makes <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/is-running-an-airbnb-profitable-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">$924 per month</a>, but that can be much higher if your property is in a tourist-heavy area. Plus, if you’re a great host, your reputation and reviews can make your rental even more sought after.</p>\n<p>So how do you become a top host on Airbnb? We talked to the experts to get their best pointers on how to make your rental stand out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airbnbhostchecklist\">Airbnb Host Checklist</h2>\n<p>Before we get started, remember the most important thing is to make sure your Airbnb rental is clean. It doesn’t matter what views your condo offers if it’s cluttered and dusty.</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, the property must sparkle, says Michael Shapot, a real estate broker for <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\">Compass</a>. “I can't emphasize enough how critical it is for the home to be beyond clean. Especially the bathroom, kitchen, and linens. Bonus points for any attention paid to the hard-to-reach corners and windows.”</p>\n<p>Now let’s go through what accommodations each room in your Airbnb property should have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bedroombasics\">Bedroom Basics</h2>\n<p>Guests get excited about bedrooms that look like a luxury hotel – think: high-quality bedding, a comfortable mattress, and simple yet functional furniture. Every bedroom should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bed, ideally an 8” thick and firm mattress.</li>\n<li>Wide dresser with at least six drawers.</li>\n<li>Nightstand.</li>\n<li>Lamp.</li>\n<li>A mirror, either above the dresser or a free-standing floor mirror.</li>\n<li>Bedding, including white pillowcases, sheets, duvet, and a comforter.</li>\n<li>Art to add a touch of color and character to the walls.</li>\n<li>Rug to accent the floor and the bedroom decor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “Airbnb hosts should clearly outline all amenities in their listings. What size are the beds, for example?,” asks Brain Davis, director at <a href=\"https://sparkrental.com/\">SparkRental</a>. “My wife and I like queen beds or larger, but so many Airbnb listings don't make it clear whether the bed is a double or a queen.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"bathroombasics\">Bathroom Basics</h2>\n<p>Clean bathrooms are key. Scrub tiles and grout to make sure there’s no mold, mildew, or dirt. Next, make sure your bathroom is fully stocked with all the toiletries a traveler needs and often forgets. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two bath towels per guest</li>\n<li>Two hand towels per guest</li>\n<li>Hand soap</li>\n<li>Shampoo and conditioner</li>\n<li>Body wash</li>\n<li>Lotion</li>\n<li>Toothpaste and floss</li>\n<li>Mouthwash with disposable cups</li>\n<li>Air freshener</li>\n<li>Disposable toothbrushes</li>\n<li>Hairdryer</li>\n<li>Extra toilet paper</li>\n<li>Hooks on the door</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “Use bathroom towels as a way to personalize and upgrade your service,” suggests Connor Griffiths, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.liftylife.ca/\">Lifty Life</a>. “Placing the bathroom towels on the bed and folding them into swans adds a high-class element.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"kitchenessentials\">Kitchen Essentials</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons people love staying at an Airbnb is the ability to cook and eat in while away from home. Guests save money on eating out and get a chance to enjoy the property more. To fully take advantage of having a kitchen, guests need small appliances, utensils, and other kitchen goods to prepare a meal. Make sure your kitchen is ready with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plates and bowls.</li>\n<li>Cups, glasses, and wine glasses.</li>\n<li>Cutlery.</li>\n<li>Cooking utensils.</li>\n<li>Pots and pans.</li>\n<li>Can opener.</li>\n<li>Coffee maker (and coffee).</li>\n<li>Toaster.</li>\n<li>Kettle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “Some hosts tend to go very cheap with the kitchen,” warns John Candelario, co-founder of <a href=\"http://vacationhomehelp.com/\">Vacation Home Help</a>. “Adding a decent blender, coffee maker, and kitchenware makes a world of difference.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"livingroomessentials\">Living Room Essentials</h2>\n<p>An Airbnb allows guests to feel at home while away from home, so make sure your living room is well-designed and inviting. This is where guests can gather and socialize, watch a movie, or play games. Get your living room ready with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sofa bed to maximize the number of guests the space can accommodate.</li>\n<li>Coffee table.</li>\n<li>Good lighting for both reading and relaxing.</li>\n<li>Flat-screen TV with cable.</li>\n<li>The WiFi password in an easy to access place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “A key thing a host can do is to provide local maps and brochures,” says Sandy Yong, author of <a href=\"https://www.sandyyong.com/book\"><em>The Money Master Book</em></a> and an Airbnb owner. “You can visit your local travel information center and pick up free pamphlets featuring tourist attractions and restaurants that your guests can check out. This will help give your guests ideas and inspiration to help them plan out their itinerary.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"householdextras\">Household Extras</h2>\n<p>Remember that your guests may be visiting for business or pleasure, so anticipate their needs with some household extras that make a world of difference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ironing board and iron (or steamer).</li>\n<li>Closet hangers, at least four to six hangers in each closet.</li>\n<li>One trash can per room.</li>\n<li>Board games (especially if you host a lot of families on vacation).</li>\n<li>Access to streaming services like Netflix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “I use a Yale smart lock with a touchscreen keypad that allows me to give digital keys to my guests,” says Michael Hoyt, owner of <a href=\"https://lifeonai.com/\">LifeAI.com</a> and Airbnb host. “I don't need to wait at the door for the guests to hand them the keys anymore. All I need to do is give them a unique six-digit code that they punch into the keypad. When the guests check out, I cancel the key code. No more lost or copied keys, and no more ‘I'm running late’ scenarios where the other person is left waiting.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"raisingthebar\">Raising the Bar</h2>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the power of a gift to really wow your guests and exceed their expectations. When you go above and beyond, you’ll often get glowing reviews and repeat guests. Here are a few ideas on how to raise the bar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave your guests a bottle of wine.</li>\n<li>Create a snack basket.</li>\n<li>Create a city guide complete with takeout menus, local attractions, and things to do.</li>\n<li>Gather coupons to local shops and restaurants.</li>\n<li>Gift a bag of locally roasted coffee beans.</li>\n<li>Leave a guest book for visitors to sign.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> “Something that always stands out in the eyes of guests is when hosts provide gifts,” says Connor Griffiths. “Gifts can be as simple as purchasing a bottle of wine or as thoughtful as a gift basket full of local treats. A thoughtful gift really stands out and is sure to be reflected in positive guest reviews.”</p>\n<p>Becoming a Superhost is really about anticipating your guests’ needs and making sure your space accommodates them. Pay attention to the details and treat your guests as if they were family members coming to stay with you for a visit. Help them feel at home.</p>\n<p>And remember, as an Airbnb host, it’s important to have the right insurance in place in case there’s an accident. We can <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">cover condos that are used as short-term rentals</a> (like Airbnb), so that If a guest trips and hurts themselves in your place, you’re covered. If you rent out your home or townhouse on Airbnb, check out our <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>. It can keep you covered and protect your rental income.</p>"

    body: "<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed flood maps to help communities better understand the risk of flooding in their communities. For decades, FEMA flood maps were the basis for flood regulations, building standards, and, until recently, National Flood Insurance Programs (NFIP) flood insurance rates.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s recently implemented Risk Rating 2.0 to update its methodology for pricing NFIP policies and deliver rates that actually reflect a property’s true risk. While its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-map-zone\">are no longer the most significant factor in rating premiums</a>, they are still used to determine which properties must have flood insurance.</p>\n<p>And that can be a real problem. FEMA’s maps are outdated and don’t reflect the <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">impact of climate change</a>, which is making more and more homes vulnerable to flooding. That could create a false sense of security for homeowners outside of FEMA-designated high-risk flood areas that aren’t required to have flood insurance.</p>\n<p>In other words: it may be part of the reason so many homeowners are utterly <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-flood/\">unprepared for a flood</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femafloodmapsfailtoreflectclimatechange\">FEMA Flood Maps Fail to Reflect Climate Change</h2>\n<p>FEMA flood maps are supposed to show how likely an area is to flood. Areas that FEMA predicts to have more than a one-percent chance of flooding in a year are considered high-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>. These areas typically have flood insurance purchase requirements as well as building regulations to minimize damage.</p>\n<p>FEMA bases its predictions and designations partly on historical data. That would be perfectly fine except it doesn’t reflect the impact of climate change, which means it doesn’t account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher water levels.</li>\n<li>More intense precipitation.</li>\n<li>More frequent hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/29/climate/hidden-flood-risk-maps.html\">reports</a> that new calculations from the First Street Foundation estimates that at least 14.6 million properties across the US are at risk for flooding, compared to the 8.7 million FEMA flood maps show.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of properties that may have more flood risk than anyone realizes. In Chicago alone, First Street’s data shows over 75,000 properties with flood risk that have gone unrecognized on FEMA flood maps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femafloodmapsareoftenoutdatedorincomplete\">FEMA Flood Maps Are Often Outdated or Incomplete</h2>\n<p>Originally, predicting the impact of climate change wasn’t an exact science, but <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/how-climate-models-got-so-accurate-they-earned-a-nobel-prize\">models are getting more accurate every year</a>. However, not accounting for climate change is only one of the problems with FEMA flood maps. The maps are also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Badly outdated.</strong> According to the National Resources Defense Council, two-thirds of FEMA flood maps <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/joel-scata/femas-outdated-and-backward-looking-flood-maps\">haven’t been updated in five years</a>, a cadence that’s required by federal law. Some haven’t been updated in more than 30 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Incomplete.</strong> Scientific American <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/studies-sound-alarm-on-badly-out-of-date-fema-flood-maps/\">reports</a> that only one-third of streams and 46 percent of coasts have been mapped by FEMA. Moreover, when data for an area isn’t updated at the five-year mark, the flood risk is considered “unknown.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flood risk is constantly evolving, so flood maps need to be updated regularly to incorporate new flood information and risks. But the cost (between <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fema_adoption-flood-insurance-rate-maps-participating-communities_bulletin.pdf\">$3.2 billion and $11.8 billion</a> makes regular updates nearly impossible. This forces FEMA to focus on more populous areas with more risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimpactoffemafloodmapissues\">The Impact of FEMA Flood Map Issues</h2>\n<p>The outcome of having outdated and incomplete flood maps is that people don’t know the risks they face. As a result, they may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unknowingly move to areas with a high risk for flood.</li>\n<li>End up underinsured when a flood hits.</li>\n<li>Build homes that can’t withstand flooding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An unprepared community can also mismanage its resources. Take for example the record-breaking downpours in Tennessee in August 2021. Not only were <a href=\"https://www.air-worldwide.com/blog/posts/2021/9/tennessee-flooding-underscores-insurance/\">few homeowners covered by the NFIP</a>, but officials were unprepared for the floods that followed 17 inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The opposite can happen, too, as it did with Hurricane Ida. FEMA predicted a storm surge of up to nine feet in Houma, Louisiana. But because flood maps weren’t updated to account for the city’s 13-foot levee system, the city used valuable resources to guard against flooding that never happened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingbetterfloodmaps\">Building Better Flood Maps</h2>\n<p>Put simply, flood maps need to accurately reflect today’s risk. The first step is to include climate change data, much like First Street’s <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/\">Flood Factor</a> does. It’s an interactive website where homeowners can enter their address to see what their risk is based on current and historical data that incorporates the location’s chance for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-intensity rainfall.</li>\n<li>Overflow from rivers and streams.</li>\n<li>Coastal storm surge.</li>\n<li>High tides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Association of State Floodplain Managers also recommends flood maps for all populated areas as well as those with potential for population growth. As flood maps are updated, they need to account for any measures taken to reduce flood risk, such as levees and dams.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s not an inexpensive undertaking to develop these maps. But catastrophic floods are even costlier. Plus, as the association notes, accurate flood maps keep people from building in risky areas so fewer homes suffer the direct cost of flood damage. Most importantly, accurate flood maps could help keep more people safe.</p>\n<p>Homeowners also need to know that there’s really no such thing as a flood-free zone. In fact, FEMA makes a regular point of noting that 25 percent of flood claims come from areas with low-to-moderate risk. And that means <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood insurance is for everyone</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>For Florida homeowners, a roof leak or other home insurance claim might just be the start of their troubles. Some contractors may take advantage of what’s called an assignment of benefits (AOB) agreement and leave homeowners in the lurch.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2019/05/24/527402.htm\">Florida passed a bill</a> in 2019 aimed to curb the abuse of assignment of benefits, it’s important to recognize the potential pitfalls of signing over your claim benefits to another party.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at what AOB abuse is so you don’t get taken for a ride.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanassignmentofbenefits\">What is an assignment of benefits?</h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignment of benefits</a> is an agreement that transfers your insurance claims rights to another party. When you sign an AOB form, you give someone else the authority to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File an insurance claim.</li>\n<li>Make decisions about repairs.</li>\n<li>Collect insurance payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners who are dealing with major damage may assign their benefits to the business making the repairs because it has more experience working with an insurance company to settle a claim. A reputable restoration company may help the homeowner navigate the <a href=\"/blog/what-is-an-insurance-claim/\">claims process</a>. But a scammer may take advantage of the situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcanassignmentofbenefitsbeabused\">How can assignment of benefits be abused?</h2>\n<p>A disreputable business can easily abuse an assignment of benefits. Once you sign this agreement, you give up your rights as the policyholder. This may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your insurance company will only communicate with the other party.</li>\n<li>You lose the right to mediate claims.</li>\n<li>You may have to pay penalties if you don’t comply with the AOB.</li>\n<li>The other party can sue your insurance company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dishonest contractors take advantage of this situation by padding the bill and hiring an attorney to sue the insurance company when it does not pay the bill in full or denies the claim. Some found the system so lucrative that they paid plumbers up to $2,500 for every homeowner who signs an AOB. Lawsuits filed by contractors who have been assigned benefits by their clients were on the rise, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/leaky-pipe-problems-pose-risk-to-florida-homeowners-insurance/2311955\">according to the Tampa Bay Times</a> – AOB claims in Florida jumped from 405 in 2006 to 28,000 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Florida’s new legislature caps attorney fees on AOB lawsuits, which should help deter these opportunistic practices. <a href=\"https://floir.com/consumers/assignment-of-benefits-resources\">Florida insurance regulators</a>Florida insurance regulators have also taken steps to share information and resources about AOBs and AOB scams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howassignmentofbenefitsabusehurtshomeowners\">How assignment of benefits abuse hurts homeowners</h2>\n<p>Assignment of benefits abuse, like all insurance fraud, can hurt policyholders. The abundance of AOB lawsuits against insurance companies drove up home insurance premiums to offset losses – in fact, this type of litigation is one of the reasons that <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">home insurance costs in Florida</a> have risen considerably in recent years. The hope is that the legislation to reform AOB practices will help bring those costs down over time.</p>\n<p>Plus, most AOB agreements permit the contractor to collect their fees from the policyholder if the insurance policy doesn’t cover the damage or the insurance provider won’t pay the full amount demanded. If the AOB vendor tries to collect from you and you can’t pay, they can place a lien on your property for the amount owed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeownerscanavoidassignmentofbenefitsabuse\">How homeowners can avoid assignment of benefits abuse</h2>\n<p>To avoid unscrupulous vendors, watch out for these red flags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone knocks on your door and tells you there is damage you didn’t know about.</li>\n<li>A contractor promises something for nothing, such as a free roof or kitchen renovation.</li>\n<li>Someone claims the damage is greater than it clearly is.</li>\n<li>Permanent repairs begin before your insurance company is notified or allowed to inspect damages.</li>\n<li>The form looks unprofessional or has misspellings and poor grammar.</li>\n<li>Forms have any blank spaces to be filled in later, after you’ve signed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also avoid an assignment of benefit scam by doing the things you would normally do before signing a contract:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> A reputable business owner is willing to answer any question you ask.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the forms.</strong> Make sure you understand what benefits you’re signing away.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your policy documents.</strong> AOBs may not be permissible for your policy, so be sure to check before you sign.</li>\n<li><strong>Know your rights.</strong> You don’t need an AOB to get your claim processed or the repairs started.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact your carrier.</strong> Before executing an AOB, check with your insurance carrier or agent to get their opinion on its validity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assignment of benefits can be useful in some situations, but be vigilant. It’s not a small thing to sign away the rights to your insurance benefits.

    body: "<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> The 2021 hurricane season officially ended on November 30, 2021. In total, there were 21 named storms, making 2021 the third most active year on record in terms of named storms and the sixth consecutive above-normal hurricane season.</p>\n<p>In 2021, hurricanes collectively caused more than $70 billion in damage in the United States, and more than 90% of it caused by Hurricane Ida. Ida reached top wind speeds of 150 mph when it made landfall in Louisiana. Then the storm system headed north to New York City, where it flooded city streets and subways. All told, the storm caused more than $60 billion damage and resulted in more than 90 deaths in the United States.</p>\n<p>Every year, the Atlantic hurricane season brings dangerous storms along the Atlantic coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. This year looks to be similar to last year where we had a record-breaking number of hurricanes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"predictionsforthe2021atlantichurricaneseason\">Predictions for the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season</h2>\n<p>As of August 4, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) experts predict an above-normal season for the Atlantic with <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/atlantic-hurricane-season-shows-no-signs-of-slowing\">15 to 21 named storms</a> (i.e., winds of 39 mph or more) in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Of those named storms, seven to 10 could have winds of 74 mph or more, making them hurricanes. They also anticipate between three and five hurricanes to be Category 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>Colorado State University (CSU) researchers, on the other hand, recently <a href=\"https://engr.source.colostate.edu/csu-researchers-continue-to-predict-active-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season-2/\">reduced their predictions for the 2021 season</a>. However, their predictions still fall in line with NOAA’s predictions for an active Atlantic hurricane season for 2021 with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>18 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CSU team also reports on the probability of hurricanes making landfall. Where the full-season average for the last century is 52 percent, the chance for landfall for the 2021 season is 65 percent. For Florida’s Gulf coast, where the full-season average has been 30 percent, CSU puts the probability for landfall at 41 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atlantichurricaneseasonofftoabusystart\">Atlantic hurricane season off to a busy start</h2>\n<p>We were only about a month into the 2021 season when we saw our first hurricane. Elsa reached Category 1 status on July 2, which is six weeks earlier than the average date for the first hurricane. Moreover, Elsa was the earliest fifth-named storm ever recorded in the Atlantic waters.</p>\n<p>But Elsa was not the first named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Prior to it, we also had tropical storms Ana, Bill, Claudette, and Danny. Ana was classified as a tropical storm on May 22, ten days before hurricane season.</p>\n<p>But is this different from previous years? Last year, the Atlantic hurricane season set a record with 30 <a href=\"/blog/how-are-hurricanes-named/\">named storms</a>, 14 of which became hurricanes, including seven major ones. And while scientist aren’t predicting as much activity in the 2021 season, there are a few interesting facts to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both the 2020 and 2021 Atlantic hurricane seasons saw five named storms by the first week of July.</li>\n<li>This year is the seventh in a row where we had a named storm prior to the start of the hurricane season.</li>\n<li>We’ve had five straight years of above-average hurricane seasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s probably too soon to call that a pattern. The <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\">Center for Climate and Energy Solutions points out</a> that there’s no clear consensus on whether climate change will increase the frequency of hurricanes. But it also notes that climate change creates conditions that lead to more intense hurricanes, which ultimately means people need to be ready for this new normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beingpreparedforhurricaneseason\">Being prepared for hurricane season</h2>\n<p>If you live in an area where hurricanes are likely, then you need a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">hurricane preparedness plan</a> that covers both sheltering in place and evacuating your home. Planning for both scenarios is important because you don’t know what your real risk is until shortly before a hurricane hits.</p>\n<p>You also want to check if you have sufficient <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Your policy most likely covers wind damage from a hurricane, but storm surge and flooding are another story. This type of loss is only covered by specialized <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policies.</p>\n<p>Anyone looking for home insurance during the Atlantic hurricane seasons – June 1 through November 30 –&nbsp;should also work quickly to secure coverage. Insurance companies generally place <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-moratorium/\">moratoriums</a> on writing new policies when a storm is on the way, which can delay getting your policy bound.</p>\n<p>Questions about your hurricane coverage?

    body: "<p>Turkey fryer fires are all too regular an occurrence on Thanksgiving, which is already the peak day for home cooking fires in the United States.</p>\n<p>Every year, there are 172,900 cooking fires – in other words, cooking causes <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/oscooking.pdf\">49% of all house fires.</a> And because Thanksgiving is such a big cooking day, it’s responsible for more of these fires than any other day of the year.</p>\n<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) reports that US fire departments responded to about <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Seasonal-fire-causes/Thanksgiving\">1,630 home cooking fires on Thanksgiving</a> in 2018. And the cost of those fires is substantial: Thanksgiving fires caused $26 million in property loss from 2017 to 2019.</p>\n<p>If it’s your family tradition to deep-fry your holiday bird, be extra careful. Turkey fryer fires can cause serious injury, according to the NFPA, and deep-frying a turkey is much riskier than roasting. In fact, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/oscooking.pdf\">52% of home cooking fires</a> are ignited by fat, grease, or oil.</p>\n<p>We mention this not to put a damper on your festivities – quite the opposite! Nothing ruins a Thanksgiving feast faster than an accidental fire, so we’re here to pass along pointers for frying your turkey safely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"turkeyfryersafetytipsarecipeforsuccess\">Turkey fryer safety tips: A recipe for success</h2>\n<p>Some folks swear by a deep-fried turkey, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/turkey-fryer-fire-safety-infographic.pdf\">arguing it’s more flavorful and crispy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1headoutside\">1. Head outside</h3>\n<p>Safety and cooking experts agree: turkey fryers belong outside. These fryers can easily tip and spill hot oil everywhere, so the best place for it is outside on a sturdy, level surface, far from things that can ignite.</p>\n<p>Before you begin your deep-fry, make sure kids and pets are at least three feet away at all times to avoid accidental burns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2dontgetdistracted\">2. Don’t get distracted</h3>\n<p>Distractions are the number one cause for cooking fires, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/turkey-safety-other-baste-practices-n938206\">according to the NFPA</a>. Because families tend to gather on Thanksgiving and spend ample time in the kitchen, it’s a recipe for potential mayhem.</p>\n<p>Instead of catching up with Aunt Barb while you tend the turkey, focus and keep your eyes on the task at hand. And if you need something back in the house, ask someone else to fetch it so you don’t leave the bird unattended while it’s frying. A fire can happen in an instant, so never leave cooking unattended.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3dontoverfillthepotwithoil\">3. Don’t overfill the pot with oil</h3>\n<p>It’s a delicate balancing act between an overfilled cooking pot and an underfilled one. Err on the side of less. If you overfill the pot with oil, it will spill over once the bird goes in.</p>\n<p>To get the right amount of oil, fill the pot with water and add the bird the day before you fry. That will give you a benchmark.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4thawtheturkeycompletelybeforefrying\">4. Thaw the turkey completely before frying</h3>\n<p>If your turkey isn’t completely thawed and dry before you fry it, you risk hot oil splatter. To avoid getting popped with hot grease while you fry, make sure your bird is thawed all the way through before it hits the fryer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5keepaneyeonthetemperature\">5. Keep an eye on the temperature</h3>\n<p>One big reason for turkey fryer fires? They get super hot and can quickly overheat. Be mindful of the temperature as you fry. Use a cooking thermometer so the oil doesn’t overheat and cause a fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6protectyourself\">6. Protect yourself</h3>\n<p>Remember that the pot, lid, and handles of the turkey fryer reach extraordinarily hot temperatures. Even the briefest contact with any of them can cause burns. Protect your hands and arms with long cooking gloves, and never handle the fryer without them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7keepcombustiblesaway\">7. Keep combustibles away</h3>\n<p>Don’t get your apron near any heat sources, including the fryer. Make sure towels and other items that can catch fire are far from the fryer, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8beprepared\">8. Be prepared</h3>\n<p>Even when you follow all the guidelines perfectly, accidents can still happen. Be prepared by keeping a fire extinguisher nearby in case there’s a fire.</p>\n<p>And if something does happen, remember that <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance does cover</a> fire damage to the home, belongings, and other structures.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your fried feast, and stay safe, friends! We hope you have a lovely holiday, however you choose to spend it.</p>"

    body: "<p>Granny flats are becoming more popular for families all across the country – and for good reason! Not only can a granny flat help aging loved ones maintain a sense of independence, but they can also offset the high cost of buying a home.</p>\n<p>But adding a granny flat isn’t a <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">simple DIY home project</a>. Let’s dig into what granny flats are and what you need to know before you decide if it’s the best option for your household.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagrannyflat\">What is a granny flat?</h2>\n<p>First thing’s first: a granny flat is a small space, typically designed for just one or two people to live in. This may be a studio apartment or small one-bedroom structure, and it may be part of your primary residence or a separate building altogether.</p>\n<p>We’re calling this kind of space a granny flat, but the more official name is “accessory dwelling unit” (ADU). You might also have heard granny flats referred to as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mother-in-law cottages.</li>\n<li>Granny pods.</li>\n<li>In-law suites.</li>\n<li>Coach houses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the name suggests, a granny flat is typically built for elderly family members so they can live on the same property as their adult children and grandchildren. However, many homeowners use these spaces for adult children or domestic employees. Some even rent them out, but that depends on local laws – more on that later.</p>\n<p>Granny flats are often designed as self-contained areas, so they include most of the amenities you’d expect in a full-sized home, like a kitchen and a bathroom, only smaller. But you may see in-law suites that are actually apartments within a home. These types of granny flats usually have separate entrances from the rest of the house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethebenefitsofgrannyflats\">What are the benefits of granny flats?</h2>\n<p>Building a granny flat has a lot of benefits for homeowners. The first, and probably the most obvious is that an ADU can mean extra living space for the family. That, and the security of knowing your older family members are close by, can be enough of a reason to build a granny flat.</p>\n<p>But there are some monetary benefits, too. One study found that ADUs can add as much as <a href=\"https://www.appraisalinstitute.org/accessory-dwelling-units-may-have-higher-values-when-using-income-approach-the-appraisal-journal/\">34% to your assessed property value</a>. Another potential bonus is rental income. Many homeowners use their granny flat to offset their mortgage payment by using them as long-term and short-term rentals.</p>\n<p>If you want to use your ADU for extra income, then you really want to take a close look at home insurance. Most homeowners policies don’t cover short-term rentals. (Learn why in our article <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">Does Home Insurance Cover Airbnb?</a>) For long-term rentals, you may need to get a <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5thingstoconsiderbeforeaddingagrannyflattoyourproperty\">5 things to consider before adding a granny flat to your property</h2>\n<p>While you may see plenty of advantages to having a granny flat, you want to think carefully before you add one to your property. Here are five things to consider before building a granny flat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost\">Cost</h3>\n<p>There’s no way around it: adding a granny flat isn't cheap. How much one costs depends on any number of factors, but the most important one is probably the type. Building any structure from the ground up can be costly, but this one needs to be a livable space. That means it needs plumbing, gas, and electrical added to make it a liveable space. But don’t forget to factor in the cost of construction and permits, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zoning\">Zoning</h3>\n<p>Check your local building codes to make sure ADUs are allowed in your area. Many places may allow single-family dwelling properties to add granny flats, but not all do. You certainly don’t want to spend the time and money building something that is against zoning laws!</p>\n<p>While you're at it, you might want to check with your homeowners association (HOA) rules.Some may forbid you from adding an ADU.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insurance\">Insurance</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> will likely be affected if you build a granny flat. Generally, a stand-alone ADU built on the grounds of a single-family home is typically covered as an other structure under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>. However, a granny flat that is freestanding and has a separate postal address, while uncommon, usually needs its own policy where it could be covered by <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>.</p>\n<p>The other option is remodeling your home to add a granny flat. If you create an in-law suite in your primary residence, then it’s most likely covered by the dwelling portion of your home insurance policy. Either way, you may want to talk to your insurer to make sure you have sufficient coverage.</p>\n<p>One more caveat: a granny flat that you use to generate income to others typically requires a different type of insurance and may not be covered by your homeowners policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"size\">Size</h3>\n<p>Size impacts costs, but it can also determine whether or not you can legally build a granny flat. Some states have laws restricting how big your granny flat can be. California, for example, only lets you build an ADU that’s <a href=\"https://edringtonandassociates.com/adus/accessory-dwelling-units-frequently-asked-questions/\">1200 square feet or less</a>, assuming there are no local laws that limit size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"permits\">Permits</h3>\n<p>You’ll likely need permits to build a granny flat. Your contractor should be able to help you pull the right ones. Don’t start work until you have the permits in hand or you risk having construction shut down.</p>\n<p>Despite these factors, adding a granny flat (ADU, carriage house, or whatever you like to call it) is definitely achievable. All it takes is a little imagination and a lot of planning, but in the end you could have a beautiful space for your family to stay.</p>"

    body: "<p>Gardening may be one of the healthiest hobbies a homeowner can pick up. Not only does gardening get you outside in the sunshine and fresh air, but it can boost your mood and give you a dose of exercise to boot!</p>\n<p>But for all of these pluses, gardening can hurt the environment. That’s why more people are looking for sustainable gardening practices that let them reap the benefits while still protecting the earth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatissustainablegardening\">What is sustainable gardening?</h2>\n<p>Sustainable gardening is a set of practices where you grow plants, fruits, and vegetables while avoiding actions that can damage the environment. This might mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding pesticides.</li>\n<li>Selecting a variety of native plants, or plants that occur naturally in your area.</li>\n<li>Encouraging pollinators, like birds, butterflies and bees.</li>\n<li>Conserving water.</li>\n<li>Composting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to be a good steward of the earth and all of its flora and fauna.</p>\n<p>With Earth Day just around the corner, the time is ripe to start your first sustainable garden. Here are some steps to get your garden blooming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1choosetherightsite\">1. Choose the right site</h2>\n<p>Picking a location is the first step no matter what kind of gardening you plan to do. If you’re looking to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden/\">start a vegetable garden</a>, then you want to find a level spot that has six to eight hours of direct sunlight. Level ground is preferable for flower gardens, too. However, some flowers grow better in partial shade. Either way, you also want to avoid areas near a tree’s root system. The tree’s roots may compete with your garden for water and nutrients.</p>\n<p>If your yard is small, or you don’t have a yard at all, you could opt for a container garden and still practice sustainable gardening. Select pots or small plant boxes that are durable or made out of renewable materials, such as clay or bamboo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2knowandtestyoursoil\">2. Know (and test!) your soil</h2>\n<p>Soil is where your plants get their nutrients, so it’s clearly an important part of your garden. However, many new gardeners don’t realize there’s more than one kind of soil, and for sustainable gardening, you have to match what you have with what you plant. Some common types of soil include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loam.</strong> Loam is equal parts sand, clay, and silt so it drains well and is good for most plants.</li>\n<li><strong>Sandy.</strong> When soil has a lot of sand, it becomes dry and not very nutritious, but you may be able to use it with root vegetable or flower bulbs if you add in organic fertilizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Chalky.</strong> You might not know if your soil is chalky by looking at it, but it will bubble when you pour white vinegar on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Peat.</strong> Peat contains decomposed organic matter and feels sort of spongy. The acid in it can make it less nutritious.</li>\n<li><strong>Clay.</strong> Clay soil is often wet and sticky. Certain types of shrubs can grow in clay soil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another important detail about soil? Many types of flowers and vegetables grow best in soil that’s somewhat acidic. You can usually get your soil tested for free at your county’s extension services office or a nearby university. Once you have your results, you can follow the recommendations to help avoid over fertilizing your garden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3picknativeplants\">3. Pick native plants</h2>\n<p>Most gardeners have a favorite flower or vegetable, but selecting plants that grow naturally in your area is a better way to go. This helps ensure that your plants thrive without needing additional watering or fertilizers that may have a negative effect on the environment. The goal is to make your garden approximately 70 percent native plants.</p>\n<p>Take some time to explore your options at a <a href=\"/blog/home-and-garden-curb-appeal/\">home and garden show</a> or ask the experts at your local garden center. While you’re at it, try to take home several varieties. The more diverse your sustainable garden is, the more pollinators it will attract.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4conservewater\">4. Conserve water</h2>\n<p>Watering a garden can be tricky. Too little water and your flowers wilt, but too much can flood roots and cause rot. And from a sustainable gardening point of view, overwatering is just wasteful. Many sustainable gardeners choose drip irrigation systems because it saves water while making sure that the soil stays nice and moist all the time without watering the leaves.</p>\n<p>You can also conserve water by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gathering rainwater in barrels or buckets.</li>\n<li>Allowing swales to collect and redistribute rainwater.</li>\n<li>Adding mulch beds to retain moisture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number one rule for conserving water, however, is to only water your garden when you need to. Check the soil with your fingers, and skip watering when it’s moist.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5feedyourgardenorganically\">5. Feed your garden organically</h2>\n<p>Over fertilizing is a no-no for sustainable gardening, but that doesn’t mean you can’t ever fertilize your garden. Organic fertilizer can be part of the process, especially if your soil needs it or you have plants that require a lot of nutrients, like sunflowers and broccoli. Moreover, your plants may need food more frequently in the middle of their growing season. If plants start to look weak, it might be time to fertilize them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6startcomposting\">6. Start composting</h2>\n<p>Composting is a great way to feed and improve your garden’s soil while reducing the amount of waste you and your family produce. The most basic steps to creating a compost pile are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a pile of both brown (e.g. fallen leaves, cardboard, newspaper) and green (manure, kitchen scraps) materials.</li>\n<li>Lightly watering that pile.</li>\n<li>Giving the pile oxygen over once per week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the size of your pile, the elements being broken down, and how often you turn it, this can take anywhere from two weeks to two years. You’ll know it’s ready when it has a rich brown color and the consistency and texture that you’d expect from soil. Sprinkle a six-inch layer of compost on your plants to give them the healthiest environment possible.</p>"

    body: "<p>Did you finally succumb to the green thumb? You've come to the right place. Here, you'll find everything you need to know to choose and care for your first indoor houseplants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestindoorhouseplantsforbeginners\">Best indoor houseplants for beginners</h2>\n<p>Ah, houseplants. Both the metaphorical and literal evidence that you are setting down roots. Whether you’re a new homeowner or just a curious newcomer to the wondrous world of our light-eating brethren, you’re in the right place. In this, The Beginner’s Guide to Houseplants, we’ll cover everything you need to know to choose and care for your first houseplants.</p>\n<p>We’ll also point you toward some resources that will help you turn over a new leaf as a gardener. Feel free to skip ahead to the topic you’re most interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattoconsiderwhenchoosinghouseplants\">What to consider when choosing houseplants</h2>\n<p>Just like outdoor plants, houseplants have preferred climates and habitats. One way you can maximize your odds of plant-raising success as a beginner is to start by considering the living conditions your plants will have. We recommend considering the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light</strong>. Maybe the most important part of the houseplant equation, your house’s lighting will dictate which houseplants will do best in your home. Make a note of which side of the buildings your windows are on (north, south, east, west) and where your home gets direct light in the morning and afternoon. There’s no right or wrong amount of light, but choosing plants that prefer the kind of light your house gets naturally will set them up to thrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature</strong>. Most of the houseplants we feature here prefer temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have areas of the house that are exceptionally drafty (like a three-season porch), know that you may need to move your plants somewhere warmer during the winter.</li>\n<li><strong>Air</strong>. Air flow is important for keeping plants functioning healthily, but air quality matters, too. Be aware of the humidity in your home. Many plants prefer more humid conditions, which may mean providing additional sources of moisture during the dry winter months (more on that later).</li>\n<li><strong>Pets and children</strong>. Some plants are toxic to <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pets</a> and children (and adults, but they’re less likely to try to eat houseplants). If you have (or plan to have) either in your house, be sure to choose houseplants that are non-toxic.</li>\n<li><strong>Yourself</strong>. Do you travel a lot? Are you wildly forgetful? Do you hate curtains? All these things can affect which houseplants will do best in your home. If you’re away a lot or the forgetful type, keep an eye out for hardy plants that don’t mind a little benign neglect. If you’d rather not hang curtains, choose varieties that prefer direct sunlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you have a sense of the kind of habitat your home has to offer, you can choose plants that are naturally suited to it. When you do that, houseplant care becomes infinitely easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"houseplantcaretipsandtricksforbeginners\">Houseplant care: Tips and tricks for beginners</h2>\n<p>The best part about having houseplants right now is that you can diagnose many problems by going online. But once there, you’ll probably find recommendations that involve things like “bright indirect light” or “medium light” or “low light” – without definitions! We’ll offer an overview of what some plant-care lingo means, along with some handy starter tips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"light\">Light</h3>\n<p>Here’s how to decode various light prescriptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Direct sunlight</strong>. What it sounds like. If your plants like direct sunlight, look for a spot near a south-facing window that gets the full force of the sun, unmitigated by curtains or shades.</li>\n<li><strong>Bright indirect or filtered sunlight</strong>. This can best be achieved by hanging a sheer curtain over a window. But plants that like “bright indirect” light may also do well in areas near windows, as long as they’re not getting the sun’s full force.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium light</strong>. These plants like light (all plants do, tbh), but they do better near a west or southeast window.</li>\n<li><strong>Low light</strong>. Plants that prefer low light do well in darker areas like bathrooms or offices that don’t get much natural light.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still not sure what kind of light you have? Try the <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Gardening/diggin-it/2008/1024/what-does-medium-light-mean\">hand-on-paper test</a>: when it’s sunny out, set a sheet of blank paper near a window. Hold your hand a foot above the paper. The more distinctly hand-like your shadow appears, the brighter the light: clear hand = direct, fuzzy hand = medium, vague shadow = low light.</p>\n<p>But honestly, you don’t have to ace the light question on your first try. As the saying goes, life finds a way, and houseplants want to live as much as the rest of us. So see how your plant does in one spot, and if it looks sad (you’ll know), move it somewhere with a different amount of light.</p>\n<h3 id=\"water\">Water</h3>\n<p>Now, a few tips on watering like a boss.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minerals in your water</strong>: Every region has slightly different mineral composition in its water. Some plants tolerate minerals better than others. Fluoride, for example, can really upset a peace lily. If a plant isn’t thriving, you may need to filter your water.</li>\n<li><strong>Water temperature</strong>: Cold water can shock plants, especially in winter. In the cooler months, let water come to room temperature before watering your plants.</li>\n<li><strong>Showers</strong>: Some plants need occasional leaf cleaning. Others just love humidity. Either way, certain plants will thrive in your shower, if you’ve got space for them. And even if you don’t, filling the tub with plants and opening the tap can be an efficient way to water them every week.</li>\n<li><strong>Egg water</strong>: Next time you hard-boil eggs, don’t drain the water when you’re done. Instead, let it cool to room temperature and use it to water your plants. They love the calcium that leaches from the eggshells during the boiling process – and you’ll feel like a total pioneer badass for being so economical.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"soil\">Soil</h3>\n<p>Also known as dirt. While it’s possible to fill your houseplant pots with plain old dirt from your backyard, consider buying some potting soil instead. This can help give your houseplants the best shot at thriving because you’ll be able to choose the best type of soil for the plants you have and because store-bought soil is much less likely to have any pests that could hurt your leaf babies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"diagnosingproblems\">Diagnosing problems</h3>\n<p>For beginners, the the most stressful prospect of raising houseplants may be the thought of what to do when problems arise: curling leaves, brown spots, yellowing leaves, loss of variegation – oh, my!</p>\n<p>The best advice we can give is to take a deep breath and plunge in. With the magic of the internet, it’s easier than ever to figure out what might be causing your plants to fuss and find a fix. Plus, every problem (and solution) you encounter will give you a better understanding of how to care for your houseplants – and make you more confident moving forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13besthouseplantsforbeginners\">13 best houseplants for beginners</h2>\n<p>Here comes the fun part: choosing houseplants to start your indoor garden. We consider all of these houseplants to be good for beginners because they’re easy to care for. From this list, it’s best to choose the ones whose preferred conditions match those of your house.</p>\n<p>(Before we get into it, one quick note: if you’ve inherited or been given a houseplant and you don’t know what it is, try doing a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en\">reverse image search on Google</a> to identify it.)</p>\n<p>Without further ado, the 13 best houseplants for beginners, broken into two groups: those that are safe for kids and pets and those that are potentially toxic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notsafeforkidsorpets\">Not safe for kids or pets</h3>\n<p>The following plants are best for homes without children or pets because these plants can be toxic if ingested. So, you know, don't eat them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dieffenbachia.jpg\" alt=\"dieffenbachia\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"dieffenbachia\">Dieffenbachia</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Street name</strong>: Dumbcane</li>\n<li><strong>Latin name</strong>: Dieffenbachia</li>\n<li><strong>Light</strong>: Filtered / bright indirect.

Don’t over-water.</li>\n<li><strong>Fertilizer</strong>: From early spring through early <a href=\"/blog/fall-home-maintenance/\">fall</a>, fertilize every two weeks, but skip fertilizing in the winter.</li>\n<li><strong>Toxicity</strong>: Toxic to kids and pets. If ingested, this plant can cause the tongue and mouth to swell, which can prevent talking (hence the name “dumbcane”). In a worst-case scenario, it can also cause suffocation, so skip this plant if you’ve got pets or little ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dracaena.jpg\" alt=\"dracaena\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"dracaena\">Dracaena</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Street name</strong>: Many – Dracaena is actually the genus name (the one pictured is called song of India)</li>\n<li><strong>Latin name</strong>: Dracaena + species name (pictured is Dracaena reflexa)</li>\n<li><strong>Light</strong>: Filtered indoor light or semi-shade</li>\n<li><strong>Soil</strong>: Good potting soil</li>\n<li><strong>Water</strong>: It doesn’t need much.

    body: "<p>With 59 percent of American adults living paycheck to paycheck, it’s little wonder that budgeting apps have taken off.</p>\n<p>The best budgeting tools help consumers plan and manage their money to pay down debt and contribute to savings and emergency funds. These apps help you identify where you may be overspending so you can reach your <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">financial goals</a> faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthebestbudgetingapp\">What Is the Best Budgeting App?</h2>\n<p>We reviewed the five best budgeting apps for homeowners. Our criteria was simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The app has to be available on both mobile and desktop.</li>\n<li>The app must be easy for a busy homeowner to use.</li>\n<li>The app must give the user clarity into both spending and saving behavior.</li>\n<li>The app must be customizable for the user and their goals.</li>\n<li>The app must sync with bank and financial accounts.</li>\n<li>The app must let you manage your bills.</li>\n<li>The app must be affordable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each category is five points a piece, and the app that earned the highest score is You Need a Budget (YNAB). More on that in a moment. Let’s see how the best budgeting apps stack up.</p>\n<p>| Features | YNAB | Mint | PocketGuard | Clarity Money | Personal Capital |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Availability | 5 – Online, IOS, Android, Alexa | 5 – Online, IOS, Android | 5 – Online, IOS, Android | 3 – Online, IOS, Android (some features only available for Apple users) | 5 – Online, IOS, Android |\n| Ease of Use | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 |\n| Spending &amp; Savings Insight | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Customizable | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Synchronization | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Bill Management | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Price | 4 – $11.99 / month or $84 / year | 5 – Free | 4.5 – $3.99 / month or $34.99 / year | 5 – Free | 5 – Free with paid options for investors |\n| Total Score | 34 | 33 | 30.5 | 30 | 29 |</p>\n<h2 id=\"1youneedabudgetynabbestforpayingdowndebt\">1. You Need a Budget (YNAB): Best for Paying Down Debt</h2>\n<p><strong>Best Feature: Color-Coded Transactions</strong></p>\n<p>One of the easiest apps for beginners to use, <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\">YNAB</a> is super intuitive. It allows you to monitor your income and expenses and offers support to adjust unwanted spending behaviors. YNAB follows the zero-sum budgeting method: it determines necessary expenses for each month and adjusts the budget accordingly.</p>\n<p>The platform safely syncs with your accounts and imports financial information to track your transactions, balances, and spending. It uses a color-coded system so you can easily identify the consequences of spending habits (e.g., yellow means underfunded and red means overspending). The onboarding process does more than just bring in data – it teaches you about <a href=\"/blog/household-budget-worksheet/\">how a budget works</a> by giving every dollar a “job.” In other words, every dollar in your budget must be allocated for a certain purpose. That’s why its users swear by this app if you want to pay down debt quickly. You can create custom categories, too.</p>\n<p>YNAB is available on a variety of platforms, including online, iOS, Android, and Alexa. It has a 4.8 out of five stars on the App Store and 4.0 out of five stars on Android. The free trial is 34 days, giving you more than a month to see if the app works for you. After that, it’s $11.99 a month or an annual cost of $84. There is no bill paying function with this app.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Score: 34 / 35</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"2mintbestmultitasker\">2. Mint: Best Multitasker</h2>\n<p><strong>Best Feature: Free Credit Score Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\">Mint</a> provides a financial snapshot of everything: your bills, assets, debts, investments, retirement funds, and credit score. It can send you alerts for late fees, overspending, bill reminders, rate changes, big purchases, and more. Best of all, it’s absolutely free.</p>\n<p>The app syncs with your financial accounts to download your data and analyze your spending habits. It also gives you spending suggestions based on your spending habits and lifestyle (that you can easily override). For example, the app might suggest spending $200 a month on entertainment.</p>\n<p>There is no bill paying option for this app, and while you can’t adjust top-level categories, you can create your own subcategories.</p>\n<p>Mint is available online, on iOS, and on Android. The app has a 4.5 star rating on Google Play and has received the Editor’s Choice award. It averages 4.7 stars on the App Store.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Score: 33 / 35</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"3pocketguardbestforcashspenders\">3. PocketGuard: Best for Cash Spenders</h2>\n<p><strong>Best Feature: Premium Version Tracks Cash Transactions</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever checked your bank account to figure out how much you have left to spend, you’ll appreciate <a href=\"https://pocketguard.com/\">PocketGuard</a>. This app focuses on letting you know what’s safe to spend after your bills and other financial goals are accounted for.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of PocketGuard: the standard plan and the PocketGuard Plus. The standard plan is free to use and the Plus plan is $3.99 a month or $34.99 a year. The Plus version lets you track cash transitions, an especially handy feature for those who prefer cash to cards.</p>\n<p>Both platforms import recurring income, expenses, and general financial data. It allows you to set goals in certain budget categories. You can customize your categories and split a payment between two categories, which might be especially useful for homeowners.</p>\n<p>Though the app is well liked, users do complain about advertisements even on the paid version. PocketGuard is available online, on iOS, and on Android. It has a 4.7 out of five-star rating in the App Store and a 4.1 out of five-star rating in Google Play.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Score: 30.5 / 35</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"4claritymoneybestforweeklyplanners\">4. Clarity Money: Best for Weekly Planners</h2>\n<p><strong>Best Feature: Easy Subscription Cancellation</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to finally make some long-term money plans, Clarity Money may be the right app for you. The app’s goal is to help you understand how your current spending habits affect your long-term goals. It offers suggestions on how to improve money management based on your current money usage.</p>\n<p>It takes a week-by-week approach with its spending plan. You can sync bank and financial data to seamlessly track spending and savings. The dashboard shows a summary of spending, credit card usage, product recommendations, and savings accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Clarity Money doesn’t have a bill-paying feature, but it can help you cancel third-party subscriptions you’re no longer using (or forgot about).</p>\n<p>Though a solid app, we took a couple points off because some features are only available for Apple users (like the ability to rename credit cards). Plus, not all financial institutions are supported (though 9,000 are). Clarity Money is free and available online, on iOS, and on Android. It has a 4.7 star rating on the App Store and 4 stars on Google Play.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Score: 30 / 35</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"5personalcapitalbestforinvestmentretirementplanning\">5. Personal Capital: Best for Investment &amp; Retirement Planning</h2>\n<p><strong>Best Feature: Customizable Retirement Planning</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/\">Personal Capital</a> is one part budgeting app, one part investment management service. You can connect and monitor your financial accounts – like checking, savings, and credit cards – and track your retirement funds, mortgages, and loans. Its categories are customizable and you can see what you’re spending versus what you’re saving and investing on its dashboard. You get an instant snapshot of your budget, assets, portfolio, upcoming bills, and more.</p>\n<p>Its customizable <a href=\"/blog/ira-tax-deduction/\">retirement planning</a> tool and investment management capabilities are the real selling points of this app, making it a good fit for homeowners who want to get serious about their future. That said, you probably need some investments to your name to get the most mileage out of this app. And while it can sync with many financial institutions, not all are supported just yet.</p>\n<p>Personal Capital has a free Financial Dashboard, but if you want to take advantage of the Wealth Management service, be aware that you need at least $200,000 to invest and will pay a 0.89 percent fee. Plus, if you’re just after a budgeting app, this option may not have the depth you’re looking for.</p>\n<p>The app is available in both the Apple Store and on Google Play. It gets a 4.7-star rating on the iOS platform while garnering only a 4.5 on Google Play.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Score: 29 / 35</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"budgetingalternativesfortheappaverse\">Budgeting Alternatives for the App Averse</h2>\n<p>Apps aren’t for everyone, so let’s look at some other ways to track and rein in your finances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the502030budgetrule\">The 50/20/30 Budget Rule</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp\">50/20/30 budget rule</a> is one strategy for creating a household budget. It’s simple: 50 percent of your monthly budget should go toward your needs and 20 percent should go toward savings or paying down debt. The remaining 30 percent goes toward wants, like entertainment and impulse purchases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"envelopebudgeting\">Envelope Budgeting</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/envelope-system\">Envelope budgeting</a> is a system that puts a set amount of money into an “envelope” for monthly spending. Every envelope has its own limits, and you can spend up to that amount. This system is especially useful for fixed expenses, like your mortgage, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, or car payment.</p>\n<p>It can also help you plan and cap spending for things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Groceries</li>\n<li>Entertainment</li>\n<li>Dining out</li>\n<li>Gasoline</li>\n<li>Gifts</li>\n<li>Vacation</li>\n<li>Recreation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a true envelope budget, you withdraw the money from your account when you get paid and literally put it in an envelope and label it. For this method, keeping large bills in the envelope may reduce the chance of spending money on smaller items. Folks are less likely to break a $50 bill for a $2 transaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zerosumbudgeting\">Zero-Sum Budgeting</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/zero-sum-budget\">zero-sum budget</a> spends every dime in the budget every month. But “spending” is based on the job of the money and includes paying yourself in savings and retirement planning. In the zero-sum budget, your savings goals are treated like any other bill and you allocate what is necessary for the month in all your bills. There should be no excess in a zero-sum budget. This is the system YNAB uses.</p>\n<p>For example, assume you bring home $3,000 per month. Your zero-sum budget might look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage: $1,000</li>\n<li>Groceries: $375</li>\n<li>Dining out: $100</li>\n<li>Utilities: $200</li>\n<li>Insurance: $100</li>\n<li>Gas: $200</li>\n<li>Clothing: $75</li>\n<li>Entertainment: $100</li>\n<li>Savings/retirement: $400</li>\n<li>Student loans: $250</li>\n<li>Credit card debt: $200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This budget allows for all the discretionary spending and whatever is leftover can be used for the next month’s budget or added to savings.</p>"

    body: "<p>Did you know your home insurance policy could do this?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thingsyoudidntknowhomeinsurancecovers\">Things You Didn't Know Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>As we’ve mentioned before, going to your local homeowners insurance agent may not be your best bet if you’re looking for a deal on the cost of your coverage. But let’s take a look at some of the best deals the typical homeowner gets in their insurance policy, including little-known coverage types and special features you can ask about.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personalliabilitycoverage_away_fromhome\">Personal Liability Coverage <em>Away</em> from Home</h3>\n<p>Most people know that their homeowners insurance offers <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability protection</a> for damage they cause to other people and their property at their home. But many homeowners policies also offer a limited amount of protection when you’re away from your home.</p>\n<p>So if you’re at a charity ball in a museum and knock over one of the sculptures on display and the nonprofit or the museum sues you, your homeowners insurance may cover the legal costs. Whew!</p>\n<h3 id=\"medicalexpensescoverage\">Medical Expenses Coverage</h3>\n<p>If someone gets hurt on your property and needs medical attention, your homeowners insurance likely offers coverage for the cost of those bills (see: <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments insurance</a>). This is a hidden gem of homeowners insurance policies. Insurance companies offer it because it’s usually more cost effective to deal with injuries immediately than to let them go untreated and develop into more expensive conditions.</p>\n<p>In other words, your home insurance company would rather pay to send someone to the ER in an ambulance, which might be a couple thousand dollars, than pay for a three-week hospital stay the guest needs after ignoring the injury for a few days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacementcostpropertycoverage\">Replacement Cost Property Coverage</h3>\n<p>When choosing which kind of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">property insurance</a> to include in your homeowners policy, the best deal is usually replacement cost coverage. If anything happens to your stuff, your insurance company can provide you with enough money to replace damaged items with new equivalents.</p>\n<p>So say your TV is 10 years old but was top of the line 10 years ago. If it’s destroyed in a covered property event, you’ll receive as much money as you need to buy a new top-of-the-line TV.</p>\n<p>The alternative is actual cash value coverage, and it’s usually not a great deal. Yes, it will save you some money on your premiums, but in the event of a claim, you’ll only get enough money to cover the current cash value of whatever items you own. So you’d have the funds to find a 10-year-old TV to put in your fixed-up living room.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slanderandlibelcoverage\">Slander and Libel Coverage</h3>\n<p>We’re not suggesting you go out and defame anyone here, but homeowners insurance policies may offer advertising injury protection as part of your personal liability coverage. This means that if someone sues you for slander or libel (making false claims in speech or writing), your homeowners insurance may help with the legal bill.</p>\n<p>That coverage typically includes payment for your defense and settlements (up to your policy limit).</p>\n<h3 id=\"safetydiscounts\">Safety Discounts</h3>\n<p>Making your home safer benefits everyone: your property is less likely to be damaged or burglarized, which means you’re less likely to make an insurance claim, which means your insurance company is less likely to have to pay out on that claim.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember about <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">safety discounts</a> is that they vary from one insurance company to another. So before investing in any major upgrades, check with your insurance carrier to see whether you qualify for a discount for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Installing a security system</strong>. Most home insurance companies offer a premium discount for a security system, but check with your carrier to make sure your specific system qualifies.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining other safety features</strong>. Smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, smart appliances – all these things can make your home and your family safer, which means an insurance company may tie them to lower premiums.</li>\n<li><strong>Getting a new roof</strong>. Depending on where you live, updating your roof so that it’s resistant to tornadoes, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, or hail can qualify you for a deal on your insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"formoregreatdealsjustask\">For More Great Deals, Just Ask</h2>\n<p>We can’t emphasize enough that the coverage and discounts available to you depend almost entirely on your insurance carrier. If you’re looking for ways to save money on your homeowners insurance or to add more coverage, call your provider and ask about what's available. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you learn.</p>"

Though Florida held on despite landfall from Hurricane Sally and two landfalls from Hurricane Eta, it’s a stark reminder of how important it is to protect your property.</p>\n<p>Hurricane shutters can help you do that by keeping windows intact and keeping rain out. They can also qualify you for more wind mitigation credits that reduce your home insurance premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"besthurricaneshutters\">Best hurricane shutters</h2>\n<p>The last section of your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation report</a> – that is, the inspection that shows how wind resistant your home is – addresses how your home’s windows and doors are protected from flying debris. The inspector will check for shatterproof windows, bracing on the garage door, hurricane-rated doors, and hurricane shutters.</p>\n<p>Hurricane shutters are an easy way to make sure your home gets this credit.</p>\n<p>And because there are a lot of choices when it comes to hurricane shutters, we’ve evaluated some of the most common types and ranked them based on their protection, ease, and affordability. You’ll find pros and cons for each type of shutter. Let’s dive in!</p>\n<h3 id=\"1stormpanels\">1. Storm panels</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/storm-panels.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Storm panels are steel, aluminum, or polycarbonate shutters that attach to the exterior walls to protect windows and doors. There are three styles. The first slides into tracks alongside the window or door frame and is secured by bolts once in place. The second version uses C-shaped tracks both above and below the windows and is manually aligned with the holes positioned on the panels. The third version affixes panels over doors and windows with bolts.</p>\n<p>| Storm Panel Pros | Storm Panel Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cost effective | Takes up storage space |\n| Can be removed after a storm | May require installation help |\n| Excellent protection | Some types require additional hardware for mounting |</p>\n<h3 id=\"2rollinghurricaneshutters\">2. Rolling hurricane shutters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/rolling-hurricane-shutters.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As you might’ve guessed, rolling shutters roll up and down over your home’s windows and doors. They are an excellent choice for homeowners who don’t want to fuss with installing and removing storm panels. When the weather’s great, you can simply roll them up until the next storm comes. Some are even remote controlled.</p>\n<p>| Rolling Hurricane Shutter Pros | Rolling Hurricane Shutter Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Some can be controlled with a remote | May require professional installation |\n| Can be rolled up when the coast is clear | Prices vary |\n| Extra insulation and privacy | Permanently affixed |</p>\n<h3 id=\"3accordionhurricaneshutters\">3. Accordion hurricane shutters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/accordion-hurricane-shutters.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>These permanently affixed shutters expand like an accordion to cover any opening, including windows, doors, sliding glass doors, and balconies. The accordion shutter rolls along a base of wheels that glide the panels into place where they are locked shut. These are quick to secure when a storm approaches – about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the house.</p>\n<p>| Accordion Shutter Pros | Accordion Shutter Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Permanently attached | Can get bulky in large spaces |\n| Easy to install | Wheels may require maintenance |\n| Can be locked shut for theft protection | Some options are pricey |</p>\n<h3 id=\"4colonialhurricaneshutters\">4. Colonial hurricane shutters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/colonial-hurricane-shutter.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>These hurricane shutters are affixed with hinges on each side of your windows. Though they’re made of metal, they have the appearance of wood and are a really attractive accent to your home. Each shutter covers half the window, and you simply fold them toward each other to fully protect the opening. The shutters are bolted together across both sides to prevent flapping in the wind.</p>\n<p>| Colonial Hurricane Shutter Pros | Colonial Hurricane Shutter Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Permanently attached | Pricier than other shutters |\n| Easy to install | Many require a storm bar to lock |\n| Aesthetically pleasing | Only available for windows |</p>\n<h3 id=\"5bahamabermudahurricaneshutters\">5. Bahama / Bermuda hurricane shutters</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/bahama-shutters.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Bahama shutters, also called Bermuda shutters, are one piece of wood that mounts over the window. When not in use, they offer shade and extra privacy. As a storm approaches, you can easily lower the shutters over the windows to completely secure the opening. These lock at the base of the shutter and can get a home storm-ready within 30 minutes for an average-sized home.</p>\n<p>| Bahama Shutter Pros | Bahama Shutter Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Permanently attached | Not as strong as other shutters |\n| Easy to install | Can block light into home |\n| Adds shade and privacy when not in use | Only protects windows |</p>\n<h3 id=\"6hurricanefabric\">6. Hurricane fabric</h3>\n<p>Hurricane fabric is a screen that protects openings against extreme weather. Because it’s a fabric, it’s ideal for large openings like patios and garage doors. This is a permanent option, and costs vary depending on the manufacturer. In order for this to qualify you for wind mitigation credits, the fabric would need to be approved by Florida and meet cyclic pressure and impact standards.</p>\n<p>| Hurricane Fabric Pros | Hurricane Fabric Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Permanently attached | Does not always meet code |\n| Usually inexpensive | Must be professionally installed |</p>\n<h3 id=\"7plywood\">7. Plywood</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/plywood.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Barring windows and doors with plywood sheets is a time-tested last resort for protecting the home during a hurricane. Ideally, the plywood would be cut to fit the inset of the window. If there are larger windows, two plywood boards can be used with a piano hinge to join them. This is a time-consuming option that can take more than an hour to install on each window.</p>\n<p>| Plywood Pros | Plywood Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | May not cover openings entirely |\n| Can be removed | Requires help for installation |\n| Last-minute purchase | Leaves bolt holes |</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteabouthurricaneglass\">A note about hurricane glass</h2>\n<p>Rather than install shutters, many homeowners are turning to hurricane glass, or impact-resistant windows. These are shatter-resistant, dual-paned windows that can withstand hurricane winds and projectiles moving at high speeds. Hurricane glass is a permanent solution that replaces old windows and must meet local building codes. Most newly built homes in Florida have hurricane glass instead of traditional windows and sliding glass doors. Learn more about <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a>.</p>\n<p>Even if you have hurricane windows, you can still install hurricane shutters for extra protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finalthoughtsonchoosinghurricaneshutters\">Final thoughts on choosing hurricane shutters</h2>\n<p>To pick the right hurricane shutter, know what type of protection you want, how quickly you want to be ready for a coming storm, and what your budget looks like. While some options like plywood may be cost effective and durable, they are time consuming and can damage exterior walls. Metal storm panels, on the other hand, have permanently affixed tracks that blend in with the home. Whichever you choose, make sure you allow yourself ample time to prepare for a storm.</p>"

    body: "<p>We’ve been in a real estate seller’s market for all of 2022, which simply means there are more people who want to buy a home than there are houses up for sale. It’s hard to say when the market might cool, but does that mean you should list your house today? This guide can help you decide if this truly is the best time to sell a house.</p>\n<p>For those of you on the other side of the equation, check out our tips on <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a home in a seller’s market</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentosellyourhouse\">When to Sell Your House</h2>\n<p>Unless you have to relocate for work or family reasons, the decision to sell your home can be very personal. Your home is likely filled with tons of memories, and realtor <a href=\"https://cameronmiller.ca/\">Cameron Miller</a> points out, this “requires the courage to let it go and the patience to anticipate a probable buyer.”</p>\n<p>In addition to emotional preparedness, there are other practical and financial indicators that tell you it’s a good time to sell, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have either too much or not enough house.</strong> Are you an empty nester who wants to lower your mortgage payments? A new parent who just realized they need a bit more space? Big life changes often mean rethinking what you want out of your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Your home is worth more than you owe.</strong> You can figure out if you’ve built enough equity in your home by subtracting your mortgage balance from your home’s estimated value. If the difference is enough to pay off your mortgage and provide a decent down payment on your next home, you may be ready to sell.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest rates have dropped.</strong> This means that new home buyers can probably buy a more expensive home, and you can afford the rates on a new mortgage after the sale.</li>\n<li><strong>You have money in the bank.</strong> You also want to have enough cash for selling and relocating, and it’s probably best to be out of debt. This puts you in the best position to buy a new home, pay the movers, and handle repairs your buyer requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you have cash on hand when you sell, it’s also a good idea to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-budget-after-buying-a-house/\">budget for repairs</a> and upgrades to your new home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebesttimeofyeartosellahouse\">The Best Time of Year to Sell a House</h2>\n<p>Most of the real estate agents we asked noted spring as the best time to sell a house. Ron Wysocarski of <a href=\"https://www.ronsellsthebeach.com/\">Wyse Home Team Realty</a> in Port Orange, Florida says the first two weeks of May are particularly strong. “Typically, a property listed during this time gets sold 18.5 days faster. Also, you can expect 5.9% more money.”</p>\n<p>However, that tip may be specific to Florida. Sean Kaufman, an agent with the <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents/sat/\">Shii Ann Huang Team</a> at Compass in New York City, finds March to be “ideal for families, since the winter holidays are over and there are several months before the children are all home from school again.”</p>\n<p>This means you really need to research your local market to get an idea of when the best time to sell a house is for your area. An experienced realtor is a good way to make sure you have a solid understanding of your area’s real estate market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebestdaytolistyourhouse\">The Best Day to List Your House</h2>\n<p>Again, the real estate agents we asked were generally in agreement that closer to the weekend tend to be the best days for listing your home. Some, like Robi Schreckhise of <a href=\"https://exprealty.com/\">eXp Realty</a> think Friday is best: “Over the past year, homes have been receiving multiple offers in the first two to three days of being listed.” Listing on Friday, he says, “gives sellers all weekend to show the home and accept an offer by Sunday night.”</p>\n<p>Others, however, prefer Thursday. Like Omer Reiner of <a href=\"https://www.floridacashhomebuyers.com/fort-lauderdale/\">Florida Cash Home Buyers, LLC</a> says, “That’s just before the weekend when potential buyers are more likely to view listed houses so the house is more likely to sell.” Moreover, Wednesdays and Thursdays top the lists for the best days to get a quick sale and to get an above-list sale in many areas of the country.</p>\n<p>This is another decision where a licensed real estate professional can be a great deal of help. Someone who knows your market can help you figure out what’s going on and how to get the most out of your home.</p>\n<p>It also means sellers probably want to have their homes ready for weekend showings by midweek. Keep your home clean and ready to show prospective buyers. This may be difficult to manage with all the responsibilities of the week, but well worth it when you look at the trends.</p>"

    body: "<p>Given last fall’s wildfire season in California and the current disastrous fires sweeping through Australia, we figured it was a good time to offer some insight on how wildfires affect homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to cover: not only have recent wildfires led to serious losses for homeowners, but they have also signaled a new normal for what wildfires and wildfire season look like in some parts of the world. This, in turn, means that insurance companies are considering how they can adjust their current risk models to properly reflect today’s climate realities.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ll look at the situations in Australia and California, offer some thoughts on where we’re headed, and provide some tips on what actions homeowners affected by wildfires can take.</p>\n<h2 id=\"australianwildfireswhatshappeningwhatwecanlearn\">Australian wildfires: What’s happening, what we can learn</h2>\n<p>As of mid-January, wildfires (or “bushfires,” as Australians call them) have burned a land area <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/australia/bushfire.html\">larger than the country of Denmark</a>. What’s really frightening is that, while the blazes started in September, the country’s riskiest wildfire season only began this month. That means there could be much more burning ahead.</p>\n<p>Already, the damage has been significant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>29 people have died</li>\n<li>More than a billion animals have been killed</li>\n<li>Current losses are estimated at <a href=\"https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disaster/2019-australian-wildfires/\">$618 million US</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experts analyzing the situation agree that, while the wildfires may not have been explicitly caused by climate change, climate change worsened them. Drought conditions and unusually high temperatures – both among the effects of climate change – created perfect conditions for the fires to catch and spread.</p>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the situation in California, you may be scratching your head right now. Why are the Australian bushfires getting so much attention when <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/business/the-2019-california-wildfires-caused-less-damage-than-the-last-two-devastating-seasons/643455\">losses from the California fires were substantially higher</a>: $80 billion (with a “b”) during the 2019 fire season, $400 billion in 2018, and $85 billion in 2017?</p>\n<p>The answer lies in how we tally “losses:” California is more densely populated than Australia (see image). While Australia’s wildfires <em>are</em> burning in areas where people live, the population density isn’t as great as in the areas of California hit by wildfires. The result is that, while California’s wildfires ruined a lot of owned property, Australia’s fires are damaging a far greater portion of wild lands. We’re seeing lower “loss” totals because nobody will submit insurance claims for the millions of acres of forest that have burned.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that wildfires are causing a lot of damage and they’re getting worse, in part, because of climate change. The severity of these fires, both in the US and elsewhere, is pushing policymakers and others to rethink how we can mitigate fire losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"californiawildfireswhatshappeningwherewereheaded\">California wildfires: What’s happening &amp; where we’re headed</h2>\n<p>We can’t discuss wildfires without discussing wildfire insurance. In most cases, a standard homeowners insurance policy (<a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO-3</a>) provides coverage for damage caused by fire, including damage from wildfires. In Australia, the same is true (though, again, their policies officially cover damage from “bushfires”).</p>\n<p>But given the extent of wildfire damage in California in recent years, many homeowners are finding that wildfire coverage is harder to come by than it once was. In the face of severe losses from a single <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> (like wildfires), private insurance companies can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">Non-renew policies</a> for homeowners in areas they deem too risky</li>\n<li>Stop selling policies in areas they deem too risky</li>\n<li>Increase premiums to help offset their risk exposure (though this may require they get approval from the state’s insurance commissioner)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurers that write policies in California have tried all of these strategies to stay profitable (and in some cases, merely viable) as wildfire damages increase. They also tried to limit their exposure to wildfires by placing a separate deductible on wildfire-specific claims; however, that practice was <a href=\"https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/2019/09/articles/insurance/now-that-insurers-cant-legally-enforce-their-5000-wildfire-smoke-damage-caps-what-have-they-done-to-make-up-for-their-unanticipated-losses/\">recently deemed illegal in court</a>.</p>\n<p>In the long term, of course, none of these solutions will be adequate because California homeowners still need insurance. Currently, state leaders, insurance regulators, and industry insiders are exploring new solutions to address the problems of wildfire and wildfire losses. Among those solutions are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finding new ways to model risk</strong>. Traditionally, future risk is estimated based on past events; in an era of dramatic wildfires worsened by climate change, those models no longer hold up. Insurers must develop new models that account for today’s climate realities.</li>\n<li><strong>Finding new ways to evaluate risk</strong>: Old models offer risk assessments that apply to entire blocks or regions. Better models rely on more granular data to evaluate the risk for individual houses (similar to what we use at Kin). This would help insurers price policies more accurately, which might enable more homeowners to afford coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the meantime, what’s available to most California homeowners are stopgap measures. For one, the California insurance commissioner has asked insurers to <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2019/release092-19.cfm\">pause policy non-renewals</a> for a year (starting December 2019). While this won’t offer long-term relief, it may buy everyone some time.</p>\n<p>Another potential fix is that the commissioner has asked California’s FAIR insurance plan to offer comprehensive homeowners insurance rather than the policies it currently offers, which only protect against property damage caused by fire. While this may initially sound helpful, the plan’s president has said it doesn’t have adequate resources to make that solution work.</p>\n<p>(For a more in-depth description of what leaders in California are doing to manage damage from wildfires, check out the report <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Wildfires-and-Climate-Change-California%E2%80%99s-Energy-Future.pdf\">Wildfires and Climate Change: California’s Energy Future</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscandotomanagetheirwildfirerisk\">What homeowners can do to manage their wildfire risk</h2>\n<p>Whether you live in Australia, California, or somewhere else at risk of wildfires, the news can be terrifying. And while wildfires are, by their nature, outside your control, there are steps you can take to manage your risk exposure. They include the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Know your risk</strong>. One reason recent wildfires have been so damaging is that existing models didn’t predict the way they behaved. Embers blew further than expected and destroyed homes that were previously thought to be relatively safe. This means homeowners who thought they were safe didn’t take precautionary measures that might have reduced the damage they suffered. So consult with a fire mitigation expert. Talk to your insurance provider. Given the new wildfire realities, find out what your risk exposure really is.</li>\n<li><strong>Manage your risk</strong>. This might mean creating defensible space around your home, upgrading with noncombustible building materials, and putting together an <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">evacuation plan </a>so that you’re ready in the event of a worst-case scenario. It might also mean updating your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> to make sure your limits are high enough to rebuild to current fire-safety building codes.</li>\n<li><strong>Know your wildfire insurance coverage options</strong>. Typically, homeowners start looking for coverage through private, admitted carriers. If policies through these carriers aren’t available, you can consider policies through non-admitted carriers. If policies through these carriers are unavailable or unaffordable, you can turn to your state’s FAIR insurance program, which offers limited, fire-only coverage for those unable to find it elsewhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t buy in high-risk areas</strong>. If you’re in the market for a new home, you have more control than most over your wildfire exposure. One effective way to manage your wildfire risk exposure is to not buy in an area affected by wildfires.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just as the majority of the <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">most destructive hurricanes</a> to hit the Gulf Coast have happened since 2000, the most destructive wildfires in California history are recent: <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Wildfires-and-Climate-Change-California%E2%80%99s-Energy-Future.pdf\">15 of the top 20 have happened since 2000</a>, and 10 have happened since 2015.</p>\n<p>We’re in a shifting reality for wildfires and other serious weather events. To ensure that homeowners can stay protected, we need to adapt: we need insurance risk exposure models that accurately calculate the risk faced by individual homes. We need risk evaluation models to reflect the changing reality of today’s climate. We need land management policies that reduce the likelihood of massive wildfires. We need homeowners to be realistic about where it’s safe and sustainable to live and build.</p>\n<p>In other words, the world is changing. If we want to continue to live safely in it, we need to change, too.</p>"

But what you may not realize is that brush clearance is important for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, too.</p>\n<p>That’s because your insurance policy is a two-way contract between you, the homeowner, and your insurance provider. It works (roughly) like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The insurance provider agrees to send you money if certain things related to your home go wrong (e.g., a fire destroys your living room, a visitor slips on your stairs and hurts themselves, etc.).</li>\n<li>You agree to keep your house in good working order to maximize the odds that nothing goes wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That second point is especially important. In the Census Bureau’s most recent survey of American homeowners (the American Housing Survey), <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html\">13.5 percent of homeowners</a> reported having zero dollars in maintenance costs in a given year.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean these homes are in perfect shape and don’t need to be maintained; <strong>all homes need to be maintained.</strong> They need new paint and they need handles tightened and driveways repaired. They need upkeep so they stay in the kind of condition insurance companies expect houses to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>This $0 figure means that nearly 14 percent of homeowners aren’t doing any maintenance at all.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re not doing <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">maintenance on your home</a> – like making sure you’re meeting brush clearance requirements – you could be at risk of violating the terms of your homeowners insurance policy. And if you are in violation, you may not be able to collect money from your insurance provider if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to understand both brush clearance requirements in your county and maintenance requirements in your homeowners policy. If you’re in doubt about either, give your insurance company a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brushclearancerequirementsincalifornia\">Brush clearance requirements in California</h2>\n<p>Brush clearance requirements depend on where in California you live. The rules in Los Angeles County are different from those in San Diego County, which are different from those in Yolo and Butte.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of what kind of brush removal you’re legally required to do, first take a look at <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fhszs_map.pdf\">this map of California’s State Responsibility Areas</a> (and you can <a href=\"https://forestwatch.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Styler/index.html?appid=5e96315793d445419b6c96f89ce5d153\">type in your address here</a> and see if your home is in a fire severity zone). It offers a color-coded view of fire risk by area. Then type “brush clearance requirements” + your county into a search engine to get exact details.</p>\n<p>Depending on where you live, you may be required to pass a yearly inspection of your property, as is <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2011-defensible-space-ordinance.pdf\">required in Los Angeles</a>.</p>\n<p>The important takeaway: know what you’re legally required to do and what the consequences are if you don’t meet those brush removal requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3optionsforbrushremovaldiycontractororboth\">3 options for brush removal: DIY, contractor, or both</h2>\n<p>Once you understand the brush removal requirements that apply to your land, it’s time to decide how you’ll meet them. You typically have three choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle all brush removal yourself.</strong> That means identifying what needs to go, doing the actual removal work, and maintaining your property year after year.</li>\n<li><strong>Hire a contractor to handle everything.</strong> That could include planning where to thin and prune, identifying whether to add new <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">plants</a> to your land (and if so, which ones), and handling maintenance over time. Bonus: this option lands you a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">home insurance discount</a> if you have an annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><strong>Work with an expert to plan your brush removal strategy.</strong> The pros can help you plan your larger maintenance and planting goals and create defensible space, but you’d handle the actual maintenance yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s a look at the benefits and drawbacks of each model.</p>\n<p>| Brush Removal Methods &amp; Considerations | DIY Brush Removal | Contracted Brush Removal | Hybrid Brush Removal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cost | Free! | $1,200 to $3,600 per acre, though this may vary based on where you live and what needs to be cleared. | Varies based on specific services you pay for (consulting, initial clearing, etc.). |\n| Time Investment | High: An initial investment of several hours of planning and working, plus ongoing maintenance. | Low: Just enough to find a contractor and handle ongoing payment. | Medium: You won't have to handle the initial planning, but you will need to spend time on ongoing maintenance. |\n| Potential Risks | Not meeting “defensible space” regulations, which could lead to fines and penalties, as well as expose your home to unnecessary fire risk. | Damage to your property, not liking the outcome of the contractors’ work (though to be fair, these are also risks if you go the DIY route). | Getting a false sense of security from expert recommendations and not adequately following through on the actual work of brush removal. |\n| Key Benefits | You’re on the front lines of your property and will be the first to know of any changes or potential dangers.You save money by handling this work yourself. | You have peace of mind knowing your property meets local fire safety regulations.You save time by outsourcing this work to experts.You qualify for a home insurance discount when you have an annual brush removal contract. | You have peace of mind knowing your landscaping plan will help you meet local fire safety regulations.You save money by handling much of the manual labor of landscaping.You save time by working with an expert to strategize your brush removal. |\n| Best For | Homeowners who are comfortable with landscaping tasks and knowledgeable about their defensible space requirements (or willing to learn them). | Homeowners who don’t have the time or inclination to undertake significant landscaping tasks on their own. | Homeowners looking for expert support in handling brush removal but are capable of general landscaping tasks; homeowners looking to save money on professional services. |</p>\n<p>The best option for you depends on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your familiarity with local defensible space requirements and your comfort translating that to a brush removal plan.</li>\n<li>Your familiarity with landscaping generally, which will determine how comfortable you are planning brush removal and maintaining appropriate plants and structures.</li>\n<li>Your comfort handling brush removal and other landscaping tasks.</li>\n<li>The amount of spare time you have to dedicate to brush removal and other landscaping work.</li>\n<li>The amount of disposable income you have to pay for professional services.</li>\n<li>Whether you want an additional home insurance discount for having an annual brush removal contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"preventinghousefireswithbrushremoval\">Preventing house fires with brush removal</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you live in an SRA, maintaining your yard to <a href=\"/blog/fire-prevention-for-homeowners/\">minimize your fire risk</a> should be one of your top priorities as a homeowner. After all, even in areas where wildfires aren’t likely to hit, <a href=\"/blog/effects-of-thunderstorms/\">lightning strikes</a> and electrical surges can spark fires. When they do, dead brush and other organic material can lead to serious damage to your home.</p>\n<p>Plus, maintaining your yard is part of overall home maintenance, which is a key responsibility you have to your insurance provider.</p>"

    body: "<p>In recent years, there have been two significant factors that have caused more people to consider relocating and buying a home in different parts of the country that they may not have considered before.</p>\n<p>The first reason is the trend toward remote work. Working from home has allowed people to choose where they want to live for reasons other than their job.</p>\n<p>The second reason? Real estate prices have skyrocketed in metropolitan areas throughout the United States, causing many people to look at areas with a lower cost of living.</p>\n<p>Buying a house in South Carolina can be an excellent choice for the reasons listed above. Real estate values and living costs across the state are relatively affordable compared to other areas. Combine those benefits with the Palmetto State’s mild climate, natural beauty, and historic charm, and you see why South Carolina is a great choice when looking to buy a home.</p>\n<p>In this article, we explain how to buy a house in South Carolina and what cities you may want to consider when buying a home there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thingstoconsiderbeforebuyingahouseinsouthcarolina\">Things to consider before buying a house in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>Before you begin searching for houses, you need to think about where in the state you want to live. Living along the coast is a different experience than choosing a home in the Blue Ridge Mountains in terms of both climate and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>You also need to think about your career and job prospects in that area. This might be less of a concern if you’re a remote worker, but you still need to consider what you want out of the location you pick. Are you drawn to the quiet of a small town? Do you want to enjoy the amenities of a larger city? These are important questions to answer before you search for houses in South Carolina for sale.</p>\n<p>If you're already from South Carolina and are simply looking to relocate within the state, you’re probably already familiar with different regions and cities. But if you’re new to South Carolina,you want to consider which part of the state appeals to you most.</p>\n<p>For example, Clemson is a popular city for young professionals that offers affordable homes with a <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Clemson_SC/overview\">median sold home price of $265,000</a>. Another option is the smaller city of Greenville, which has a thriving business district.</p>\n<p>South Carolina also offers many areas that may appeal to people looking to enjoy outdoor lifestyles and activities. With 78 acres of parks and greenways, the city of Mauldin is a good example that’s just about an hour away from Greenville. Median home prices in Mauldin are a bit higher than in Clemson, but you generally get more house for your dollar.</p>\n<p>Whatever you're looking for in a new home, South Carolina likely has something for you. But it’s essential to understand exactly what you want out of your new community first before deciding on a home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findingahouseinsouthcarolina\">Finding a house in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>There are several tools you can use to help you find currently listed homes in South Carolina. One of the best ways is to work with a local realtor who has experience in the state and the specific cities you are interested in.</p>\n<p>This is especially true if you’re coming from out of state. The internet can be a great resource for finding information on various cities, but nothing beats the advice of someone with years of experience in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Try to find your own realtor instead of simply working with the listing agent for the home you are considering. The listing agent works for the seller, so you want to balance the equation by getting an agent who will keep your best interest in mind during negotiations..</p>\n<p>Of course, you can use sites like Zillow and other popular real estate portals to do your own research. But when it comes time to look at houses and make offers, working with a professional real estate agent typically produces the best results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stepstotakebeforebuyingahomeinsouthcarolina\">Steps to take before buying a home in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a home</a> in South Carolina may have aspects unique to the state, many of the steps listed here are typical no matter where you’re looking. Use them to make your experience as smooth as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startbuildingyourdownpayment\">Start building your down payment</h3>\n<p>If you haven't already, start putting money aside for a down payment. Over the last year, lending criteria have tightened, so the more significant your down payment is, the more options you will have when buying a home in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>The general rule when looking for a home is to have 20% as a down payment ready to go. According to Zillow, this translates to about $53,000 based on the <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/home-values/51/sc/\">median home prices in South Carolina</a>.</p>\n<p>Haven’t started saving up for that kind of down payment? Don’t lose hope! We know of at least <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">13 ways to afford a house</a>. One option is to look into the various government programs that help first-time buyers <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">get a home with no money down</a>. For example, the US Department of Veteran Affairs offers loans to eligible applicants, as does the US Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p>If you don’t qualify for these programs, you may want to investigate loan options from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). You may be eligible for an FHA loan with as little as 3.5% down depending on your credit score.</p>\n<p>You might also want to check out <a href=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/HomeBuyers\">state-run programs</a>, Some are designed specifically for first-time home buyers in South Carolina while others simply encourage homeownership. Examples from SC Housing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.schousing.com/home/HomebuyerProgram\">Homebuyer Program</a> that helps low-to-moderate income individuals and families afford mortgages by offering a competitive <a href=\"/blog/how-does-mortgage-interest-work/\">fixed-rate mortgage</a> and down payment assistance.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/Palmetto-Home-Advantage\">Palmetto Home Advantage</a>, which offers several types of mortgages and forgivable down payment assistance to people with at least a 640 credit score.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/MortgageCreditCertificates\">Mortgage Tax Credit Certificates</a> that provide up to $2,000 in federal tax credit that homebuyers can use as additional income on their mortgage applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First-time home buyer grants in South Carolina usually have a set of criteria you must meet before you may qualify, so be sure to do your research.</p>\n<p>Make sure to look into these programs or ask your realtor about them. A little bit of extra work may help you save that down payment for other expenses and make the loan process easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosetherightrealtor\">Choose the right realtor</h3>\n<p>Choosing your realtor may be the most critical factor when determining whether or not your home purchase goes smoothly. A realtor has expertise in many of the things that you simply don’t know much about, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting pre-approved for a mortgage.</li>\n<li>Locating the right neighborhood for your budget and lifestyle.</li>\n<li>Identifying market conditions that may make it difficult to buy a home.</li>\n<li>Negotiating the best deal for you.</li>\n<li>Finding first-time homebuyer programs in South Carolina for which you may qualify.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons and more, real estate agents are an indispensable resource for any homebuyer.</p>\n<p>Some key questions to ask when deciding on a real estate agent are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How long have you been a real estate agent in the area?</strong> Longer is usually better.</li>\n<li><strong>How many transactions have you completed in the past year?</strong> Once again, more is generally better.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you work in my price range?</strong> A realtor who specializes in luxury homes may not be the best fit for those looking at starter homes.</li>\n<li><strong>How are your reviews?</strong> Although this can be a bit tricky to determine, someone with overall negative reviews may not be the best fit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, you don't have to pick the first agent you meet. Try to contact more than one and see which one fits your needs the best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gettingyourfinancesinorderformortgagepreapproval\">Getting your finances in order for mortgage pre-approval</h3>\n<p>You want to get pre-approved for a mortgage in your price range. This allows you to work more closely with an agent and is a sign to sellers that you’re a serious buyer who is ready to make an offer immediately.</p>\n<p>Once you get pre-approved, don't make any drastic financial decisions that could change your credit score. Buying a new car or racking up credit card debt after you’re pre-approved may cause problems when you try to finalize your loan.</p>\n<p>This may also be a great time to check your credit score and other financial information. Make sure there’s no false or outdated information that could cause you to pay a higher interest rate than you should. Going over your credit score may take some time, so it’s best to start well before you start applying for a loan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startshoppingforahouse\">Start shopping for a house</h3>\n<p>Once your real estate agent has been chosen and your pre-approved mortgage letter is in hand, you can start to shop for houses in your price range.</p>\n<p>The time of year you choose to buy a new home can have an impact on the market. Spring and summer tend to be busy periods for home buying, so that means more competition. Homes may not stay on the market as long, creating smaller inventories and sometimes higher prices.</p>\n<p>Fall and winter are typically slower months, so sellers may be more willing to bend prices. However, every situation is different, and there are no guarantees. (Another good reason to work with a professional real estate agent!)</p>\n<h3 id=\"makeanofferandcloseonyournewhomemake\">Make an offer and close on your new homemake</h3>\n<p>When you've found the perfect place, it's time to make an offer. This is another area where your agent can help. They will let you know what constitutes a good offer based on market conditions.</p>\n<p>So how much are houses in South Carolina? Zillow lists the median home price as around $267,835 at the time of writing. But you will set your offer based on the market you are shopping in.</p>\n<p>Deciding on how much to offer can be tricky. On the one hand, you want to get the best deal, but you also want to increase your chances of closing the deal. That’s a delicate balance that needs to work for both the buyer and the seller, and your agent plays a significant role in that process.</p>\n<p>Once the offer is accepted, you will move on to the closing process. <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">Closing costs</a> in South Carolina can include fees for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loan origination.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">Home inspections</a>.</li>\n<li>Credit reports.</li>\n<li>Attorneys.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">Home insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your agent can walk you through these and all the other fees, plus any paperwork that’s likely required..</p>\n<p>Once completed, you close on your new home!</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestareatoliveinsouthcarolina\">Best area to live in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>The best area to live in South Carolina really depends on your personal preference. The best place for a young, professional couple may not be the right choice for a retired couple looking for a relaxing country home. Thankfully, South Carolina offers something for almost every home buyer.</p>\n<p>Below is a selection of the most popular areas and what they have to offer to specific homebuyers. Median prices are all from February 2023.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clemson\">Clemson</h3>\n<p>One of the most popular locations in South Carolina, Clemson is great for families or professionals. Offering affordable homes, a thriving business district, and easy access to the Blue Ridge mountains makes this a great place to call home.</p>\n<p>Clemson University is also nearby, so this area trends younger. With median home prices right around $260,000, Clemson can be a great option for almost any budget.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greenville\">Greenville</h3>\n<p>Greenville is smaller than some of the cities on this list, but it still has a robust business district along with an arts and culture scene that defies its small size.</p>\n<p>Home prices are slightly higher here, with a <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Greenville_SC/overview\">median price of $299,000</a>, but that’s still much lower than in other areas of the country. Greenville also caters to people of almost any age, so anyone from young adults to and retirees can feel comfortable making a home in Greenville.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mauldin\">Mauldin</h3>\n<p>This suburb of Greenville is great for those who want a little more space and a relaxing atmosphere while still being close to the city. Mauldin's schools rank as some of the best in the state, so it's perfect for families with young children. The more relaxed lifestyle also makes this a great choice for older home buyers.</p>\n<p>What makes this area even more appealing is the <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Mauldin_SC/overview\">median price per square foot is $161</a>, making it one of the better deals in the state. Buyers looking for a lower cost of living will find a great option in Mauldin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"charleston\">Charleston</h3>\n<p>It's hard to find a more historic city than Charleston. This city is popular for its breathtaking landscape and rich history. Many of its streets are still paved with cobblestones, evidence of its roots that date back to the 1600s.</p>\n<p>However, Charleston is one of the pricier places to live in South Carolina. The median listed price for homes in the city is <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Charleston_SC/overview\">$535,000</a>. That said, Charleston may be the perfect city for anyone who loves historical architecture and Southern charm appeals to you,</p>\n<h3 id=\"lexington\">Lexington</h3>\n<p>Near the state capital of Columbia, Lexington gives you access to the larger city while still providing the comforts of small-town life. The city is an excellent choice for those who love the outdoors. With proximity to the mountains and the coast, it has everything you need for your next outdoor adventure.</p>\n<p>Homebuyers may get a lot more for their money in Lexington. The median listing price is $280,000, but the per square foot median is $147.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sullivansisland\">Sullivan's Island</h3>\n<p>Considered one of the most luxurious places to live in South Carolina, Sullivan's Island median listing price exceeds $5 million. But that price gets you into a very exclusive town with a population of just over 2,000. If you are looking for the best South Carolina offers, look into Sullivan's Island.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morehelpwithbuyingahomeinsouthcarolina\">More help with buying a home in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>Buying your new home can be a time filled with excitement and new beginnings.

    body: "<p>In recent years, the California insurance market has changed drastically in response to the state’s severe wildfires. And climate change is only making the problem worse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whycaliforniahomeownersneedbetterinsurance\">Why California Homeowners Need Better Insurance</h2>\n<p>Now California’s <a href=\"/blog/wildfire-season-is-year-round/\">wildfire seasons are year round</a>, and the ongoing drought has only created more dry brush – fuel for severe fires. At the time of this publication, the August Complex Fire is only <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/\">43 percent contained</a>, a continuation of the wildfires that have raged since early August, and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/us/california-wildfires-zogg-glass-wednesday/index.html\">Glass and Zogg Fires are still burning in Northern California</a>.</p>\n<p>Some early estimates put the 2020 wildfire season at more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/california-fires-cost.html\">$20 billion</a> in direct costs, far more than the <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2019/05/08/525930.htm\">$12 billion 2018 season</a>. Beyond the devastation it caused, the 2018 Camp Fire also set a precedent for insurance companies to drop policyholders for their wildfire risk.</p>\n<p>Many Californians weren’t eligible to renew their policies with their existing insurance company before the insurance commissioner put a <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/12/06/california-temporarily-bans-insurers-from-dropping-policyholders-in-wildfire-areas\">one-year cancelation ban</a> in place. Last year, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wildfires-california-homeowners-insurance-hard-to-find-due-to-magnitude-of-massive-wildfires/\">350,000 California home and business owners</a> couldn’t get property and casualty insurance at all.</p>\n<p>That changes now.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Kin is entering the California market because of its wildfire risk, not in spite of it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"kinbringseasyaffordablehomeinsurancetocalifornia\">Kin Brings Easy, Affordable Home Insurance to California</h2>\n<p>Our co-founder and CEO Sean Harper summarizes it perfectly: “Kin is entering the California market because of its wildfire risk, not in spite of it.” We’re not shying away from catastrophes – we see it as <a href=\"/blog/35m-series-b-funding-to-fix-home-insurance/\">an opportunity to serve homeowners who need our solution the most</a>.</p>\n<p>When we saw insurance companies abandoning homeowners right when they needed insurance the most, we made plans to enter California. We wanted to offer an affordable private market solution for homeowners who would otherwise be <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">left to get coverage through the California FAIR Plan</a>, a state-funded insurance option of last resort.</p>\n<p>The California FAIR Plan covers damage caused by fire, lightning, internal explosion, and smoke damage. That’s it. For coverage for windstorm, water damage, or theft, you’d have to find an insurer that would issue a policy for just those coverages. To top it off, FAIR policies are very expensive.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a> policies cover damage to the home from all events except those explicitly excluded, and include coverage for other structures, your belongings, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments. <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">Wildfire insurance</a> is included, and you can easily add on earthquake insurance, too.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our easy online platform, homeowners can get a quote in seconds and be insured in minutes. Our technology takes the guesswork out of getting the right coverage – we make smart recommendations and you can adjust your coverage in real time to see how it impacts your price.</p>\n<p>We’re 3 percent cheaper on average than other private insurance companies in California, but often the savings are much higher. For example, on average, we’re <strong>10 percent cheaper than Allstate</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can see our average premiums by county below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ca%20premiums%20county.png?width=714&name=ca%20premiums%20county.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"howwekeepcaliforniahomeinsuranceaffordable\">How We Keep California Home Insurance Affordable</h2>\n<p>We put our technology to work to <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">price risk on a granular level</a>. That means we pull thousands of data points about your home so we get an accurate look at your risk. So while other insurers may charge you for your whole ZIP code’s risk, we price your policy for you, not everyone else.</p>\n<p>That helps us price policies super competitively. The average premium of a Kin policy is $1,188 a year in California. That’s lower than the state average <em>and</em> includes wildfire risk. Our rates are filed and approved by the California Department of Insurance, so what you see is what you get. No surprises down the road.</p>\n<p>Of course, your rates are based on your home’s unique data points – its age, exact location, construction, and safety features.

    body: "<p>California wildfire season is the hottest and driest part of the year: May through October. Though climate change has altered wildfire season as we know it, homeowners should be extra vigilant during warmer months. Wildfires are only getting more frequent and severe.</p>\n<p>The 2020 wildfire season is already shaping up to be one of the most extreme seasons California has experienced. Thanks to the ongoing drought, there’s plenty of dry vegetation and dead trees that act as fuel once met with the smallest spark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/brief-history-of-wildfires/\">Wildfire season</a> is only getting longer and more severe, but don’t take our word for it. These California wildfire statistics show just how much wildfires have changed over the years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"californiaswildfireriskataglance\">California’s Wildfire Risk at a Glance</h2>\n<p>California had more wildfires than any other state in 2019, and by California standards, 2019 was a mild year. State and local resources fought 7,860 wildfires that burned more than 259,000 acres. By contrast, Alaska had 720 wildfires that burned 2.5 million acres, and Arizona had 1,869 fires that burned 384,000 acres.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/california-acres-burned.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/\"><em>Cal Fire</em></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ca-wildfires-by-year.png?width=875&name=ca-wildfires-by-year.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/\"><em>Cal Fire</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"top10mostdestructivewildfiresincalifornia\">Top 10 Most Destructive Wildfires in California</h2>\n<p>Jump to this year, and California is on track to have the most destructive wildfire season to date. In August 2020 alone, nearly <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/22/california-wildfires-updates-saturday-map-redwood-trees-burn-big-basin/3419083001/\">585 wildfires</a> burned nearly one million acres in a week and 700 homes.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/777801169/the-camp-fire-destroyed-11-000-homes-a-year-later-only-11-have-been-rebuilt\">Camp Fire</a> destroyed the entire town of Paradise and claimed 85 lives. More than 52,000 residents had to be evacuated, and many didn’t have a home to return to when the 153,000-acre fire was finally extinguished. Considered the most costly natural disaster in the world in 2019, federal aid paid nearly $2 billion just to remove toxic debris and $200 million to victims in need of aid. Total insured losses are estimated between <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-wildfires\">$8.5 billion and $10.5 billion</a>, and the total damage and economic losses are <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/california-wildfires-will-cost-tens-of-billions-accuweather-estimates/612548\">projected to be more than $400 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>Though California doesn’t always have the most wildfires of any state, it usually has far more losses. That’s because it’s the most populous state in the nation, with nearly 40 million residents, and many folks live near or in wildfire zones, subjecting them to danger and property losses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/top-wildfires-ca.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Source:</em> <em>Cal Fire</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/biggest-california-wildfires.png?width=911&name=biggest-california-wildfires.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <em>Cal Fire</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"topwildfirescausesincalifornia\">Top Wildfires Causes in California</h2>\n<p>California has perfect conditions for wildfires. Its risk is directly tied to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dry weather, thanks to an ongoing drought.</li>\n<li>Lack of forest management.</li>\n<li>An influx of development in the Wildland Urban Interface.</li>\n<li>High winds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Its dry weather is fueled by the longest drought in the state’s history that started in 2000. While the most extreme part of the drought was between 2014 and 2017, Californians still face the repercussions of the water shortage to this day. As you might’ve guessed, you can thank climate change for the rising temperatures that cause droughts.</p>\n<p>Native trees and plants are dying off, creating more kindling, and being replaced by invasive grasses that burn easily. The Forest Service tries its best to <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a29623250/california-fires/\">trim brush and implement prescribed burns</a> to manage the forests and curb the risk of fires, but most of its yearly resources go toward combating massive fires instead.</p>\n<p>As folks continue to develop and live in the Wildland Urban Interface, risk only increases. These homeowners could lose homes to wildfires and accidentally start fires themselves, especially if they don’t adhere to brush clearance guidelines. Proper clearance means removing any and all native brush, weeds, grass, <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">trees</a>, and hazardous vegetation.</p>\n<p>Coupled with California’s Santa Ana Winds in the south and the Diablo winds in the north, a single spark could create and spread the massive wildfires we’re seeing today (and cause those infamous fire tornadoes).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/how-do-wildfires-start\">According to the Los Angeles Times</a>, the following have all ignited wildfires in California:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Power lines / electrical equipment</strong>, as seen in the Camp Fire. California’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/californias-largest-utility-warns-tens-of-thousands-of-people-could-see-power-shut-off-due-to-extreme-fire-risk.html\">ancient utility grid</a> can easily cause sparks and ignite nearby lands. These fires often start in remote, difficult-to-reach locations and sweep across mountains and valleys, finding communities along the way.</li>\n<li><strong>Sparks from vehicles or lawnmowers</strong>, which caused the Carr Fire and Zaca Fire, respectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Signal fires</strong>, which caused the Cedar Fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Lightning</strong>, the culprit for the Rush Fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Human error</strong> (such as arson, campfires, cigarettes, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/07/us/california-fire-el-dorado-gender-reveal-trnd/index.html\">fireworks</a>, and faulty wiring). One rancher’s mission to plug a wasp’s nest by planting a stake into the ground caused the Mendocino Complex Fire.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has identified 35 high priority projects to clear <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/whats-expected-for-the-2020-california-wildfire-season/745087\">vast dead trees</a> that increase fire risk. To put that in perspective, that’s nearly 90,000 acres and 200 communities at risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehighcostofcaliforniawildfires\">The High Cost of California Wildfires</h2>\n<p>Wildfire destruction is costly. In 2019, more than <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2019/release041-19.cfm\">$12 billion in claims</a> were filed from the 2018 Camp Fire, Woolsey Fire, and Hills Fire. And that’s just insured losses – many homeowners most at risk for wildfires may not have coverage.</p>\n<p>AccuWeather estimates between damage to homes and businesses, belongings and cars, job and wage losses, farm and crop losses, infrastructure damage, school closures, highway closures, and power outage costs puts the 2018 wildfires at $400 billion in losses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ca-economic-cost.png?width=822&name=ca-economic-cost.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/california-wildfires-will-cost-tens-of-billions-accuweather-estimates/612548\"><em>AccuWeather</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"wildfireinsuranceishardertoget\">Wildfire Insurance Is Harder to Get</h2>\n<p>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wildfires-california-homeowners-insurance-hard-to-find-due-to-magnitude-of-massive-wildfires/\">350,000 California homeowners</a> couldn’t get home insurance after the 2018 wildfire season. Now consider that about <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wildfires-california-homeowners-insurance-hard-to-find-due-to-magnitude-of-massive-wildfires/\">2 million</a> California homes are in wildfire zones. Of those, <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/wildfire-victims-are-largely-underinsured-116580.aspx\">nearly 80 percent</a> are underinsured and 60 percent are significantly underinsured.</p>\n<p>The sea change toward leaving these homeowners behind isn’t the answer. Folks in hard-hit areas need the resources to rebuild after a fire, just like any other homeowner.</p>\n<p>Homeowners who can’t get coverage through private insurance companies are forced to buy policies from the <a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/index.php/consumers/differenceinconditions/\">California FAIR Plan</a>. These policies are written on a named-perils and actual-cash basis by default, meaning the home is only covered for fire damage and claim payouts subtract the home’s depreciation.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">Kin California homeowners insurance</a> protects your home on an open-perils basis (covers all risks except those explicitly excluded) for its replacement cost (you receive what it actually costs to rebuild your home from the ground up). Every policy also includes coverage for your belongings, other structures, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments.</p>\n<p>And yes, <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> is included.</p>"

    body: "<p>Can a landlord require renters insurance? In most states, they can – although, we recommend you check with local and state laws before you add anything to your leases. The better question is: Why would you want to?</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywouldalandlordrequirerentersinsurance\">Why would a landlord require renters insurance?</h2>\n<p>The answer to that is relatively simple too. While your <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> safeguards your interests, making sure your tenant has renters insurance, also called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 policy</a>, adds another layer of protection. We’ve listed seven ways it benefits a landlord to require renters insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1reducingyourchancesofbeingsued\">1. Reducing your chances of being sued</h2>\n<p>Maybe one of the best reasons for landlords to require renters insurance is that it can reduce their chances of a lawsuit. Tenants who have their own coverage are less likely to start pointing fingers when things go awry - and that can mean fewer headaches for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2helpingtopayadditionalexpensesinadisaster\">2. Helping to pay additional expenses in a disaster</h2>\n<p>Imagine owning a rental property where some sort of disaster makes the place uninhabitable, like a fire or hurricane. Your landlord insurance may cover the damage to the building and even your <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">lost rental income</a>. But it seldom pays your tenants’ relocation and additional living expenses.</p>\n<p>Renters insurance policies, however, usually have a loss of use provision that helps renters pay for temporary accommodations. Even if you’re not liable for those costs, tenants who have this coverage may be more likely to recover and return to your property quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3coveringtenantspersonalproperty\">3. Covering tenants’ personal property</h2>\n<p>Just like your tenants’ additional living expenses, your landlord insurance doesn’t cover your tenants’ personal property. So if their belongings are destroyed in a similar disaster, there’s a chance your tenant may sue you to replace them. This is less likely if you require renters insurance. Making coverage part of the rental agreement puts the responsibility on your tenant to have the right amount of coverage in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4beingpetfriendly\">4. Being pet friendly</h2>\n<p>Allowing renters to have a cat or dog may make your property more attractive to potential tenants, but pets can cause liability issues, including dog bites and property damage. This is one reason so many <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policies</a> have animal exclusions. If you do decide to allow pets, then you should require tenants to carry renters insurance that covers animal liability. Not requiring it could cause you to be dragged into a lawsuit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5limitingyourpolicyclaims\">5. Limiting your policy claims</h2>\n<p>When your renters have insurance, you may find you have fewer claims to file on your landlord insurance. That can be a big benefit to you because multiple claims can impact your premium. You should note, however, that requiring renters to have insurance can’t eliminate all potential claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6findingqualitytenants\">6. Finding quality tenants</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest jobs of a landlord is filling their rental properties with good tenants who pay their rent on time. Applicants who balk at the idea of carrying renters insurance may give you a heads-up about how financially responsible they are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7loweringyourdeductible\">7. Lowering your deductible</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies sometimes offer incentives for behaviors that make insuring a property more attractive. For example, we have a renters policy incentive <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> for landlords who require renters insurance. If a landlord has a claim and can provide proof that their tenant had insurance at least 14 days prior to filing, then we’ll reduce the landlord’s <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> by 50 percent or $750, whichever is lesser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchrentersinsuranceshouldalandlordrequire\">How much renters insurance should a landlord require?</h2>\n<p>How much renters insurance you require depends on several factors, but the most important of these is probably the value of your tenants’ personal belongings. Renters with $30,000 in property need at least that amount of coverage, plus around $100,000 in liability coverage. But every tenant is different, so you may want to discuss the specific coverage amount with each applicant before you add it into the lease.</p>\n<p>Being a landlord isn’t easy, but it can be a good way for homeowners to make extra cash.

    body: "<p>You just got a notice from your home insurance company that says your policy is being canceled. Now what?</p>\n<p>Take a deep breath and get ready to act quickly. You have a small window to get things back on track so you can keep your house protected and meet your mortgage requirements.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what to do if your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy is canceled. You’ll learn the difference between a cancelation and a non-renewal and common homeowners insurance cancelation reasons, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywouldaninsurancecompanycancelyourhomeinsurancepolicy\">Why would an insurance company cancel your home insurance policy?</h2>\n<p>A canceled policy means the insurance company terminates an existing policy before the term is through. In other words, the coverage will end before the original expiration date. If you’ve had the policy for at least two months, there’s usually only two reasons that would happen: you didn’t pay the premium or they suspected fraud.</p>\n<p>But a policy could also be canceled or not renewed because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too many claims have been filed.</li>\n<li>Bad credit.</li>\n<li>Aggressive pet breeds.</li>\n<li>A new trampoline or pool.</li>\n<li>The property is vacant.</li>\n<li>Criminal record.</li>\n<li>Coverage is no longer available in your area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have too many claims, you may want to better protect your property to reduce the chance of loss. That might mean replacing old plumbing that keeps failing or installing a security system to prevent theft. At the end of the day, when you file fewer claims, your premiums will be lower and you’re less likely to face cancelation.</p>\n<p>Things like credit score, pets, and trampolines depend on your company. Chances are you just need to find an insurance company willing to take these types of risks – they exist; you just need to find them.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t living in your home, you may need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/second-home-insurance/\">second home insurance</a> to protect the property. Even if your policy isn’t canceled but it’s sitting vacant for most of the year or occupied by someone other than the owner, you could risk your claims being denied because you don’t have the right policy in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedifferencebetweenbeingcanceledvsnonrenewed\">The difference between being canceled vs. nonrenewed</h2>\n<p>Both a canceled policy and a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">nonrenewal</a> result in the need to get insurance elsewhere. But there are a couple of important differences.</p>\n<p>When a policy is canceled, the coverage will end before the original term expires. As we discussed, this rarely happens except in cases of fraud or nonpayment. Insurance isn’t free, after all.</p>\n<p>Insurance fraud may be lying on the policy application in order to get coverage or get higher coverage for a home not valued as high. It can also include making fraudulent claims.</p>\n<p>A non-renewal means the insurance company reviewed the policy with the intent to renew but found the home no longer meets its requirements. Every company has its own underwriting guidelines, so what’s uninsurable for one company isn’t necessarily so for another.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies must give you ample notice in either case: up to 20 days for a cancelation and 45 days for non-renewal so you can get new insurance in place.</p>\n<p>Just because one insurance company has given you notice of non-renewal or cancelation doesn’t mean your home is uninsurable. There are usually things you can do to improve your eligibility and there are always other companies that will happily protect your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourhomeownersinsuranceiscanceled\">What to do if your homeowners insurance is canceled</h2>\n<p>If you get a cancelation or non-renewal notice, call your current insurance company right away. There may be something that can be done to keep coverage in force. For example, if you missed a payment, you may simply need to pay your premium. If you’re no longer living in your home, you may be able to get a landlord policy instead.</p>\n<p>Sometimes insurers allow you to remedy the problem before the cancelation date. For example, if your old roof is the reason for your nonrenewal, you might be eligible for coverage once it’s replaced.</p>\n<p>If your insurance carrier doesn’t offer a solution, shop around for a new policy. Different companies take on different risks. For example, one company may have a <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breeds list</a> and not insure homes that have German shepherds. Another company may happily insure your home regardless of the canine company you keep.</p>\n<p>Look for companies like Kin that specialize in insuring “risky” states. We offer <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> as well as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/mississippi/\">Mississippi</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a>. </li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While other insurance carriers have stopped offering new policies in these states, we believe in serving homeowners who need our solution the most.</p>\n<p>If you’ve shopped around and still can’t find takers, consider contacting your state’s FAIR plan. The Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) is a state-run program that provides insurance for those who can’t get a policy from the private market. It’s a pretty common option for homeowners in California’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire zones</a>, for example.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been canceled or non-renewed, give us a call and see if we can help you out.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you pay for your home insurance through an escrow account, you’re not alone.</p>\n<p>Many homeowners set up an escrow account through their mortgage company so they can use part of their monthly payment to cover insurance premiums and property taxes. While those with less than 20 percent down on a house are usually required to have an escrow account, any homeowner can request one through their mortgage company.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many folks think switching <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> is a hassle if the policy is paid for via escrow. That misconception may keep them from saving hundreds or thousands of dollars a year.</p>\n<p>Switching your coverage when you have an escrow account is actually easy to do, and it can reduce your monthly expenses. It’s also worth noting that you have the right to change insurance companies at any time for any reason.</p>\n<p>In this article, we take a look at how to change your homeowners insurance with an escrow account so you can see how simple it is – even when you’re in the middle of your policy term.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getyourcurrentdeclarationspage\">1. Get your current declarations page</h2>\n<p>When you’re <a href=\"/blog/finding-new-homeowners-insurance/\">shopping for new home insurance</a>, don’t make the switch on price alone (although that’s a high priority!). Request a copy of your declarations page from your current company, or if you don’t know who your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> is, you can find out through your mortgage company.</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a> lists your coverages and limits so you can directly compare your new quote to what you currently have. Pay close attention to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a> (dwelling insurance) and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a> (personal property insurance) – you don’t want to shortchange these. Though you may decide some coverage options aren’t as important as they seemed when you first bought insurance, match each coverage to ensure you’re accurately comparing prices.</p>\n<p>If you just go on price, you may get less coverage, and that can leave you vulnerable when a storm hits.</p>\n<p>Get more tips in our guide for <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/best-home-insurance/\">finding the best home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2checkthemortgageeclause\">2. Check the mortgagee clause</h2>\n<p>Your new policy will have a mortgagee clause that states the insurance company will pay the mortgagee (i.e., you lender) if you experience a loss involving your home. The mortgagee clause includes your lender’s official name and address, and if it isn’t properly filled out, your lender may not get the information it needs.</p>\n<p>Your lender may think that you’re no longer insured, which may cause it to buy <a href=\"/glossary/force-placed-insurance/\">force-placed insurance</a>. This is usually much more expensive than the coverage you buy for yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2buythenewpolicy\">2. Buy the new policy</h2>\n<p>Buy your new policy <strong>before</strong> you cancel the old policy – you don’t want a <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-lapse/\">lapse in coverage</a> that could leave you uninsured for damages that happen in that window. You’ll have the option to pay for your new policy (usually in full) with your escrow account. For Kin, you just need to submit the name of your mortgage company so we can bill them for the new policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4cancelyouroldpolicy\">4. Cancel your old policy</h2>\n<p>Give your old insurance company a call and let them know you have changed insurance and want to cancel your policy. Tell them the date you got new coverage, even if it was a couple days earlier. If you have any unused premium, you’ll receive a prorated refund based on your new policy’s start date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5sendrefundstoyourescrowaccount\">5. Send refunds to your escrow account</h2>\n<p>Mortgage companies usually pay premiums annually. So if you switch in the middle of your policy term, your old insurance company may owe you a refund for the unused premium. This is typically sent to you directly, not your mortgage company.</p>\n<p>Lenders may cover any shortage if you don’t have enough funds in your escrow account to pay for the new premium. When that happens, you can usually repay them in a lump sum or over a stretch of months.</p>\n<p>Another option, however, is to send the refund to your mortgage company. That way, your lender can use the refund to cover the shortage, and you may avoid higher monthly mortgage payments as you rebuild your escrow account.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage company may send you a notice to ask for approval to pay the new insurance company. Once you approve, they will send the payment, and your new policy will be squared away.</p>\n<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeschanginghomeinsuranceinescrowcostmoney\">Does changing home insurance in escrow cost money?</h2>\n<p>Changing home insurance in escrow doesn’t necessarily cost any money. However, your new insurance company may require a down payment to start the new policy. In that case, you may need to make a payment if there isn’t enough in the escrow account to cover the cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"willmymortgagepaymentchangewheniswitchinsurers\">Will my mortgage payment change when I switch insurers?</h2>\n<p>If you have an escrow account, your mortgage monthly payment may go up or down. Your mortgage portion hasn’t changed – that stays the same unless you <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinance the mortgage</a>. Your total monthly mortgage payment typically only changes if your property taxes or your homeowners insurance costs have increased or decreased.</p>\n<p>If you see a change and aren’t sure what caused it, you can request an audit of your escrow account. Your mortgage company will review the account and let you know the results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canichangehomeownerspoliciesmidterm\">Can I change homeowners policies mid-term?</h2>\n<p>If you want to change your insurance company for any reason, you can. Think you’re paying too much for insurance and want to cut costs? No problem. Had a claim that wasn’t handled well? You can change insurance companies. Just because the insurance is handled through escrow doesn’t mean you’re stuck with that insurance company.</p>\n<p>No matter where you are in your policy term when you switch – near the renewal date, mid-term, or just a couple months in – the same steps outlined above apply if you pay through escrow. You can switch policies at any time.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote</a> to see if you can get better coverage at a better price.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in July 2020.

    body: "<p>South Carolina may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of hurricanes, but the Palmetto State has definitely seen its share of storms. It ranks fifth on the list of states with the most hurricanes. Luckily, only five of those have been major hurricanes (i.e., Category 3 or above), but even a Category 1 hurricane can cause damage to roofs and siding.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to reduce your chances for this type of damage is by preparing for the Charleston, SC, hurricane season. Let’s take a look at when the hurricane season starts and how you can better prepare for a hurricane or tropical storm in Charleston.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whenishurricaneseasoninsouthcarolina\">When is hurricane season in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The hurricane season in South Carolina lasts from the beginning of June to the end of November. Typically, the peak months span between mid-August to mid-October, with September seeing the worst storms.</p>\n<p>Of course, some homeowners face a greater risk for hurricane damage because of where their homes are located. For homeowners in Charleston, SC, hurricane season is usually more risky. Their county has some 90 miles of coastline, making it more likely to see hurricanes than most of the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"charlestonschurricaneseasonhowtoprepare\">Charleston, SC, hurricane season: How to prepare</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most challenging part of preparing for hurricane season in South Carolina is getting started. Homeowners often push hurricane prep off because they’re unsure where to begin.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, start small with a list of preparation steps so you can check items off as you go. We’ve compiled several suggestions to get you started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getemergencysupplies\">Get emergency supplies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stock up on nonperishable foods like cans of vegetables and beans, rice, and other easily prepared items.</li>\n<li>Set aside money for emergencies like hotel stays, food, and other expenses.</li>\n<li>Don’t forget about your pets! You want to make sure you have a <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet disaster preparedness plan</a> so your furry friends have what they need if you have to evacuate.</li>\n<li>Store enough clean water to last you and everyone in the house a few days. You may need drinking water, but you’ll also want to be able to cook and clean.</li>\n<li>Check your first aid kit to see if you have enough supplies to take care of everyone in your household. While you’re at it, stock up on any prescription medications so you have them on hand during an emergency.</li>\n<li>Keep all of your vehicles fueled up and consider having an extra gas can filled and accessible. As the storm nears, it might also be a good idea to have a vehicle relatively packed for a quicker evacuation.</li>\n<li>Buy a backup generator, a fire extinguisher, and extra flashlights. Keep extra batteries with your emergency supplies.</li>\n<li>Find a safe, water-proof place to store all your important documents like medical information and identification documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it doesn’t exactly fall in the category of “emergency supplies,” insurance is another important item to check. Make sure all your insurance policies are up to date and active, including your <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina homeowners policy</a>, flood coverage, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. Having solid coverage in place before a storm hits can help you recover from Charleston hurricane damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"planforemergencyscenarios\">Plan for emergency scenarios</h3>\n<p>Another important step in getting ready for hurricane seasons is planning for the various emergency situations you might face during a major storm. For this step, you might want to start with scenarios within your household and work outward.</p>\n<p>For instance, emergency services will likely be busy during a hurricane, so you want to make sure people in your household know basic first aid, how to work the fire extinguisher, and other critical skills. Here are a few common emergency situation you can plan for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power outages</strong>. What will you do if the power goes out? How will you cook food or charge critical electronics and other essential appliances? Get tips in our article <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prep-for-a-power-outage/\"><em>How to prep for a power outage.</em></a></li>\n<li><strong>Communications</strong>. Do you have a way to communicate with emergency services and stay updated with the latest information during a hurricane? If not, it may be time to invest in a hand-cranked or solar power emergency radio.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical.</strong> Does everyone in the household know how to use all the first aid equipment and other lifesaving techniques?</li>\n<li><strong>Flooding</strong>. Hurricanes typically cause flooding, so knowing <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-flood/\">what to do during a flood</a> is key to your disaster plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Evacuations</strong>. Where will you go if you need to evacuate your home? Are you going to a local shelter or staying with family in a safer area? Do you have more than one route for getting to a safer location? You want to answer all of these questions, and write down your plans and routes so you don’t forget in the heat of the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> You may not have a lot of time to evacuate, so you might want to put together a grab-and-go kit with essentials, such as food, medications, and cash.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prepareasastormapproaches\">Prepare as a storm approaches</h3>\n<p>Hurricanes are one of the few catastrophes that give some warning. That means you may have some time to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Board up windows with shutter boards or plywood.</li>\n<li>Put appliances on counters or move them to the second floor.</li>\n<li>Secure fences, bring in patio furniture, and tie down any fixtures in your yard.</li>\n<li>Move your vehicles into a protected area like a garage and preferably on higher ground.</li>\n<li>Check the <a href=\"https://www.scemd.org/prepare/know-your-zone/\">evacuation zones in South Carolina</a>. (Authorities announce evacuations based on these zones.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever you do, pay attention to the latest weather updates and emergency notifications. If you’re asking yourself, “Is Charleston, SC, being evacuated?” check the city's website. It lists Charleston evacuation plans that include <a href=\"https://www.charlestoncounty.org/departments/emergency-management/hurricane.php#zones\">evacuation zones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.charleston-sc.gov/1693/Transportation-Evacuation\">pick-up points</a> for people who need transportation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startingyourhurricaneseasonpreparation\">Starting your hurricane season preparation</h2>\n<p>The Charleston, SC, hurricane season might seem a long way off, but it’s really just around the corner.

    body: "<p>Full disclosure: we initially planned to time this post to correspond with the start of hurricane season (June 1) to help Florida homeowners understand their flood risk at a time when it was particularly relevant.</p>\n<p>But the tool we’re about to share with you was (ahem) flooded with popularity after being featured on a local media outlet. As of now, though, it’s up and running again, so we’re excited to spread the word.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsafloodanalysismemofam\">What’s a flood analysis memo (FAM)?</h2>\n<p>A flood analysis memo (FAM) is the report you get when you submit a request to <a href=\"https://www.nofloodflorida.com/\">No Flood Florida</a>, a group founded by two water resources engineers who were struck by the devastation caused by hurricane-related flooding and decided to do something about it.</p>\n<p>No Flood Florida combines data from FEMA and local sources to compile reports that give homeowners a concrete snapshot of their flood risk exposure. The group’s goal in providing these reports is to empower Florida homeowners to make informed decisions about their houses, finances, and futures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoshouldgetafam\">Who should get a FAM?</h2>\n<p>Today, anyone who’s interested in learning about a vacant property or a single-family home can request a FAM. Below is the list of Florida counties where the service is available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alachua</li>\n<li>Brevard</li>\n<li>Broward</li>\n<li>Charlotte</li>\n<li>Citrus</li>\n<li>Collier,</li>\n<li>Desoto</li>\n<li>Duval</li>\n<li>Flagler</li>\n<li>Franklin</li>\n<li>Gulf</li>\n<li>Hardee</li>\n<li>Hernando</li>\n<li>Hillsborough</li>\n<li>Indian River</li>\n<li>Lake</li>\n<li>Lee</li>\n<li>Leon</li>\n<li>Manatee</li>\n<li>Marion</li>\n<li>Martin</li>\n<li>Miami Dade</li>\n<li>Orange</li>\n<li>Osceola</li>\n<li>Palm Beach</li>\n<li>Pasco</li>\n<li>Pinellas</li>\n<li>Polk</li>\n<li>Sarasota</li>\n<li>Seminole</li>\n<li>St. John</li>\n<li>St. Lucie</li>\n<li>Sumter</li>\n<li>Volusia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re thinking of building, buying, or selling property in one of these areas, requesting a FAM may be wise. Knowing your flood risk will allow you to make a better-informed decision about how to proceed with your plans. It will also give you a sense of what to expect during major weather events.</p>\n<p>You should probably get a flood risk analysis, even if you don’t think your home’s in a high-risk flood zone. While flood insurance is only required by properties in Florida that are mortgaged, it’s a product that <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">everyone in Florida should consider</a>, as recent hurricane seasons have shown.</p>\n<p>Another good reason to look into your flood risk? <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Homeowners insurance in Florida</a> almost never covers flood damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsthebenefitafloodriskanalysis\">What’s the benefit a flood risk analysis?</h2>\n<p>One of the major benefits of applying for a FAM is that the information it contains will likely be more thorough than relying on any single rating factor (like your <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-zones\">flood zone designation</a> set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency).</p>\n<p>Practically speaking, having a FAM on hand could give you a concrete idea of what might happen to your home or property when the next big hurricane hits. That’s important in part because flooding from hurricanes is not covered by traditional homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Surprised?</p>\n<p>You’re not alone. A lot of people mistakenly think their homeowners insurance covers hurricane damage. But here’s the deal: homeowners insurance only covers wind damage associated with hurricanes (this is what you might hear referred to as “<a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>”). So if a hurricane blows your roof off, your homeowners policy will likely pay for a replacement roof. That coverage may be subject to a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> that’s separate from your policy’s normal deductible.</p>\n<p>But if that same hurricane causes a nearby river to rise so high that it floods your living room, your homeowners policy won’t pay for repairs. For that type of coverage, you’ll need a flood insurance policy.</p>\n<p>And to know how much coverage you’ll need on that flood policy… well, that’s where the FAM can come in handy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtorequestyourfloodanalysismemo\">How to request your flood analysis memo</h2>\n<p>If you’re ready to receive a detailed flood risk breakdown, you can request one through No Flood Florida’s “Contact” page. After submitting your information, you will receive the report via email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherprecautionstotaketopreventflooding\">Other precautions to take to prevent flooding</h2>\n<p>If you live in Florida, you know that hurricane season is in full swing. If you haven’t already assessed your home’s risk of flood, there are <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">several steps you can take</a> to shore up its defenses, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Securing your windows.</li>\n<li>Moving any electronics above ground level.</li>\n<li>Securing outdoor furniture before a storm hits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For longer-term protection, consider upgrading your roof according to <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">Florida’s wind mitigation guidelines</a>. Essentially, these outline how to maximize the strength of your roof to minimize the likelihood that it will be damaged in high winds. In many cases, upgrading your roof may decrease your homeowners insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you live in a flood-prone area, carry <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.

    body: "<p>The homeowners insurance industry is built on risk models that help companies decide which homes to insure and which ones to walk away from. Forecasting how much they might pay in claims allows insurers to cover those costs. The more accurate an insurance company’s predictions are, the more likely it is for the company to be profitable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, climate-related risks, such as rising seas, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, and worsening droughts, have made the old forecasting models nearly obsolete. And when insurance companies aren’t sure what the risks are, they take steps to protect themselves. This often means leaving areas most exposed to climate-related risks.</p>\n<p>Kin is different because we're built to tackle the climate crisis head on. How? By integrating weather modeling into our tech infrastructure, we get <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">ultra-granular exposure measurement</a> that enables us to serve high-exposure markets.</p>\n<p>In non-insurance speak? We look at a lot more (and a lot better) data so homeowners in places like California, Florida, and Louisiana pay less for essential coverage.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhECgrwRlgI?autoplay=0&rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Video Transcription</em></p>\n<p><em>[Sean Harper speaking] As the world warms, the weather is getting much more extreme. Last year (2020) we got hit by five hurricanes in the United States. That's more than we've ever been hit by before. The last four years have been historic wildfire years in all of the American West. So legacy insurance companies crave stability, and they have a hard time responding when anything changes. And so what you see happen is in places where the weather becomes more extreme, more variable, the big insurance companies that you know of, they often just pull out, which leaves people who live in those areas with a really big problem which is they can't get insurance. They can't get good insurance. At Kin, we've built an insurance company that can respond really fast to change. We can do that because we're high tech and because we're using a lot of data that's never been used in the industry before. That allows us to provide insurance in places where other companies can’t, which is really important because you can't actually live there unless you're able to get insurance.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whytraditionalinsurancecompaniesarentreadyforclimatechange\">Why Traditional Insurance Companies Aren’t Ready for Climate Change</h2>\n<p>Legacy insurance companies are built on outdated and inflexible technology. This makes it difficult – even impossible – for them to respond quickly to new information and external changes. Most also rely on just a few details to figure out how risky a home is to insure, and much of the information they get comes directly from the person applying for coverage. Those answers for some key questions are often guesses at best.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest problem for traditional insurance providers is that they think they can outrun climate change. Put simply, climate change is a global problem, and there won't be anywhere to run in 10 years. Still, legacy insurers are responding by tightening their underwriting guidelines, and the few consumers who fit those guidelines may find themselves priced out of coverage.</p>\n<p>The data insurers need to improve their ability to insure homes in high-risk areas is available. And it's time to adapt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimpactofclimatechangeonfloridahomeownersinsurance\">The Impact of Climate Change on Florida Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Right now, it's hard to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a>. Insurance companies have been paying out large claim settlements for catastrophic storms for years, but climate change has upped the price tag, causing insurers to either raise premiums or opt out of the Sunshine State altogether. In fact, insurance companies in Florida <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2021/05/20/three-florida-property-insurers-will-drop-a-total-of-50000-policies/\">recently dropped 50,000 policyholders</a>.</p>\n<p>Just because you already have insurance doesn't make you safe from losing it. An insurance company can choose not to renew coverage when your policy expires. This is called a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">non-renewal</a>, and insurance companies sometimes use it to get risky homes off of their books. With more homes exposed to natural disasters because of climate change, more insurance providers are non-renewing homeowners policies to better protect their bottom line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeskininsurancerespondtoclimatechange\">How Does Kin Insurance Respond to Climate Change?</h2>\n<p>While it's true <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">every home will likely be impacted by climate change</a>, that doesn't mean every home will be impacted the same way. Everything from the building materials to the foundation type to the terrain it's built on can impact a home's ability to survive major damage.</p>\n<p>That’s why we retrieve reliable data from a variety of sources, including the government, satellite images, and real estate archives. Once we’ve collected this data, we use advanced technology to analyze it thoroughly. This allows us to get more accurate readings of how much money a home should be paying for insurance – even in regions that are repeatedly bombarded by hostile weather. The end result is affordable home insurance for more people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customercareduringdisastersclaims\">Customer Care During Disasters &amp; Claims</h3>\n<p>Claims can be particularly tricky for legacy insurance companies because of the influx of losses during a catastrophic event. Overloaded, already slow systems mean long wait times for customers to even file claims. Long processing times often leave customers wondering if they’ll ever see their damaged homes repaired.</p>\n<p>Our solution is to create systems that interact with customers directly during a crisis. First, we text customers who are in harm’s way with resources to help them prepare. Then we send a post-storm text to find out if they’re safe and to get information we need if they’ve suffered any damage, including pictures that can help us get a claim started for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattheclimateemergencymeansfortheinsuranceindustry\">What the Climate Emergency Means for the Insurance Industry</h2>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">recent climate report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, the climate emergency is here and it’s already impacting our lives. As climate change intensifies, it will continue to impact home insurance. Premiums will likely keep rising and quality coverage will be harder to get.</p>\n<p>However, that’s only true if insurance companies can’t adjust to changing times. At Kin, we know better data and direct-to-consumer distribution are key to handling the new normals that climate change brings. We’re not only better able to assess risk, but we can also help our customers best mitigate it.</p>"

    body: "<p>The impact of climate change on the insurance industry is substantial. As more frequent and severe storms hit cities across the US, more people are experiencing catastrophic losses. The increase in these losses forces many traditional insurance companies to raise their home insurance rates. Some have even found the situation so unmanageable that they’re pulling out of high-risk regions, or worse, becoming insolvent.</p>\n<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way, at least that’s what our co-founder and CEO Sean Harper. believes. He acknowledges that climate change is terrible and needs to be stopped. However, he also points out that the impact of climate-related risks like hurricanes is something we can model. And that means that while it may be a large expense, it's a manageable one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howclimatechangeimpactshomeinsurance\">How climate change impacts home insurance</h2>\n<p>The impact of climate change has been an area of concern for the insurance industry going back at least two decades. But as the number of <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions\">billion-dollar disasters</a> steadily increases, so does the anxiety. The cost of paying a large number of catastrophic claims means many insurers have to rethink their <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a> and even their ability to sell policies in some locations.</p>\n<p>For homeowners, that turns into two for important questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Will I be able to find <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>?”</li>\n<li>“Will I be able to pay for it if I do?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take Florida as an example. Hurricanes batter the state’s coastline every year. Add to that the increased cost of doing business in Florida, and it’s easy to see <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">why insurers raise premiums</a>, send <a href=\"/glossary/non-renewal/\">non-renewal notices</a> to homeowners, or leave the state altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyinsurersshouldbepreparedforclimatechange\">Why insurers should be prepared for climate change</h2>\n<p>Climate change is going to cause big expenses for <a href=\"/glossary/property-and-casualty-insurance/\">property and casualty insurance</a>, and the costs are most likely going to be passed on to consumers. One <a href=\"https://www.karenclarkandco.com/news/publications/\">report on insured wind losses</a> shows that our warming climate has caused more Category 3 and above hurricanes. The additional storms have already pushed losses up by 11 percent above what we’d expect if climate change wasn’t a factor.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the report also says global temperatures are projected to increase by an additional 0.4 to 1.3 degrees C by 2050 and that will most likely cause average annual hurricane wind losses to increase an additional 10 to 19 percent by 2050. That’s a big jump, but it’s spread out over 30 years. Plus, insurance companies have this information and can use it to prepare for the cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howinsurerscanprepareforclimatechange\">How insurers can prepare for climate change</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies have to incorporate climate science when they create their catastrophe models, but they can also use technology that helps them price their policies more fairly. For example, we’ve done this by taking in more information about every homeowner that applies for coverage. Looking at this <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data</a>, much of it from public records, allows us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set premiums that more accurately reflect the actual risk for each home.</li>\n<li>Ask <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-questions/\">fewer questions on our application</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, these two outcomes make getting insurance easier.</p>\n<p>Technology is also key to speedy claims process, as you can see in <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-ida-case-study/\">our response to Hurricane Ida</a>. Because we have access to so much data, we were able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how our customers might be impacted by the storm.</li>\n<li>Alert them that the storm was coming and provide safety tips and shelter listings.</li>\n<li>Send post-storm wellness checks.</li>\n<li>Get aerial imagery for 94 percent of our impacted customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another step that <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> can take is to use <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">reinsurance</a> to protect their business in the event numerous policies have to be paid out at once. Essentially, reinsurance is a contract between your insurance company and a reinsurer. The insurance company pays the reinsurer to take on some of the risk that comes with covering homes. By passing on some of its risk to the reinsurer, the insurance company is able to offer more affordable coverage in areas that are prone to certain, catastrophic <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important way insurance companies can help their policyholders is to educate them about their risks. <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">Home insurance discounts</a> are one way we encourage our customers to take action, but we also provide educational content on things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">Florida wind mitigation</a>.</li>\n<li>Basic <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">Disaster preparedness</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these can help homeowners harden their property against damage – and that can reduce their chances of filing claims.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the impact of climate change on the insurance industry may be unavoidable, but it’s also predictable. Insurance companies have to find ways to get homeowners the protection they need at an affordable price.</p>"

    body: "<p>Hurricane season is well underway, which means homeowners along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast are (hopefully!) prepared for the possibility of fierce storms hitting their homes. But it looks like climate change’s impact on hurricanes means people beyond this area may see more named storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morepeopleexposedtohurricanerisk\">More people exposed to hurricane risk</h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00859-1\">study published in Nature Geoscience</a>, tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes in the Western hemisphere; typhoons in the Eastern hemisphere) are moving towards midlatitude regions. The expanding storm zone exposes more people and properties to hurricane risk, including those in high-density cities like Boston and New York.</p>\n<p>The basis for the changes is a shift in wind patterns known as <a href=\"https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/hadley.html\">Hadley cells</a> that create jet streams. In Hadley cells, warm air at the equator rises, cools as it moves towards a pole, and then sinks as cold air returns to the equator. Unfortunately, warmer temperatures at higher latitudes pull the jet streams towards midlatitude regions and can potentially bring hurricanes with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesclimatechangeaffecthurricanes\">How does climate change affect hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Before we discuss how climate change affects hurricanes, let’s take a quick look at how these powerful storms form. According to the National Ocean Service, hurricanes start when a low pressure system causes warm, humid air near the ocean’s surface to rise. The air cools as it rises, forming clouds and thunderstorms. At the same time, warm air from the surrounding area takes its place in the low pressure system. The pattern continues, creating the rotating clouds we see in hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Hurricanes require warm ocean temperatures and humid air﹘two conditions common in tropical regions. But climate change has made both more prevalent, and scientists say that may <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\">transform how hurricanes act</a> in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expanding storm zone.</strong> As we already noted, hurricanes are finding their way to northern regions more frequently and putting more people in harm’s way.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher wind velocity.</strong> Experts anticipate hurricanes will have higher wind velocities as ocean temperatures rise. Essentially, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, creating stronger winds and more hazardous conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased rainfall.</strong> Warmer air can <a href=\"https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/ocean-observation/understanding-climate/air-and-water/\">hold more water vapor</a> than cooler air. The result is the potential for wetter storms and an increase in flooding in many communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Slower moving storms.</strong> Scientists have yet to figure out why, but hurricanes have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/616814022/hurricanes-are-moving-more-slowly-which-means-more-damage\">slowed by 10 percent</a>. Many believe that warmer temperatures mean there is less difference in pressure between the poles and tropics, slowing down the currents that carry storms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long story short? Climate change is increasing the impact of hurricanes for more people than ever before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"otherwaysclimatechangeimpactsweather\">Other ways climate change impacts weather</h3>\n<p>Scientists say that climate change has impacts beyond the frequency and ferocity of hurricanes. With the changing climate comes warmer summers, colder winters, and generally more volatile, less predictable weather. Tornado alley – long a staple of the American midwest – has actually <a href=\"/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">shifted east</a> in recent years to now include much of the American south.</p>\n<p>The ways in which <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change affects homes</a> and homeowners are significant. As climate change rearranges weather patterns, it also alters the risk homeowners – in terms of both the type and severity of damage caused by extreme weather. These impacts are already causing home insurance premiums to go up in areas already feeling the consequences of climate change</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparingforhurricanesmovingforward\">Preparing for hurricanes moving forward</h2>\n<p>When it comes to hurricanes, knowledge is power. You can take steps to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare for hurricane</a> by fortifying your home against the possibility. Depending on your situation, that might mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning an evacuation route.</li>\n<li>Purchasing hurricane supplies, like a generator, spare gas, and sand bags.</li>\n<li>Installing <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> and a wind-rated garage door.</li>\n<li>Making a disaster kit.</li>\n<li>Storing valuable and important papers above the ground floor in a waterproof pouch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to be prepared to either shelter in place or evacuate, and you should have a clear plan for either option. Either way, you want to have enough emergency supplies to sustain yourself and your family after a storm hits because it may be days or weeks before emergency help can assist.</p>\n<p>Next, increasing hurricane risk means you want to review your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most home insurance policies cover damage caused by hurricane winds, but water damage is another issue. If your hurricane risk has gone up, then you might want to invest in <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, take a good hard look at your insurance company. You want to make sure that it has the <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">financial strength</a> to come through on catastrophic claims. Without that, you could have trouble getting back to normal after a hurricane. Check out our <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-ida-case-study/\">response to Hurricane Ida</a> to get an idea of just how seriously we take our claims process.</p>"

    body: "<p>Florida home insurance is expensive, to say the least. Our most recent data shows the average Floridian pays just under $2,000 per year for their coverage. That makes the Sunshine State the third most expensive for homeowners insurance, just behind Louisiana and Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the state legislature has signed bills to hopefully bring homeowners some relief from <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida’s increasing insurance rates</a>. Unfortunately, it’s going to take some time before the new laws’ impact makes its way to the people who need it the most. Until that happens, it’s up to Florida homeowners to figure out how they can control their home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>That’s where we can help. Our Kinfolk have decades of industry experience under their collective belts, so we know a thing or two about saving money on home insurance. Here are a few ideas for Florida homeowners who want to control their insurance costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardenyourhomeagainstrisk\">Harden your home against risk</h2>\n<p>Does it seem unlikely that an insurance company would want to help homeowners lower their insurance costs? In a recent <a href=\"/blog/you-asked-we-answered/\">Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit</a>, our CEO Sean Harper acknowledged that it might seem counterintuitive, but pointed out that when homeowners live in a safe home, “we pay less for <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance/\">reinsurance</a> we need to insure that home.”</p>\n<p>Florida state law requires <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> to set premiums that cover their reinsurance costs and the claims they expect to have. So basically, when reinsurance prices go up, insurers that rely on reinsurance have to raise their rates, too.</p>\n<p>Hardening your home against risk can go a long way towards controlling your home insurance premiums. In Florida, a large part of the overall premium is driven by hurricane risk, but homeowners can mitigate that risk by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Securing your roof.</strong> Roofs in need of repair are more vulnerable to wind and rain, so start by inspecting your roof for <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">signs of damage</a>. You may also want to consider improving your roof-to-wall attachments. Florida home insurers give discounts to homeowners with <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Protecting your windows.</strong> Whether you get <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> or impact-resistant windows, you want to guard against flying debris that could damage your windows and let rain in.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps and cracks.</strong> Keeping water out is a major concern, so check the exterior of your home for openings and seal them up with caulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Diverting water. Y</strong>ou want your gutters to move water away from your foundation, but they can’t do that if they’re clogged with debris. Keep them clean and set up downspouts to divert water.</li>\n<li><strong>Trimming your trees.</strong> Hurricane winds can knock down even healthy branches, so hire a professional to trim them back and to remove dead or dying trees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners can also look to <a href=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\">My Safe Florida Home</a>, a program that provides owners of site-built, single-family, residentials properties with funds for hurricane mitigation inspections and home-strengthening improvements. Recent legislation allocated $150 million in funds to the program. </p>\n<h2 id=\"understandhowyourcoverageworks\">Understand how your coverage works</h2>\n<p>No one expects homeowners to be experts on their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> – that would be asking a lot! But the more you know, the better you can control your costs. For example, insurance companies usually offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for behaviors that are beneficial to them, like installing security alarms. State governments can do that too, which is why so many Florida homeowners know to ask their insurers about <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspections</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">Deductibles</a> are another coverage feature that you can use to control your costs. Essentially, a deductible is the amount of risk you’re responsible for in a loss. If you’re comfortable taking on more of the risk, you can increase your deductible to lower your premium.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that you want to select a deductible you can afford even if you’re hit with a catastrophic loss.</p>\n<p>Another feature of your policy that you may want to look into is how your property is valued. Typically, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>, the part that insures the structure of your home, is based on your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This means their insurers don’t subtract depreciation when figuring out the amount of the loss in a claim.</p>\n<p>However, Florida homeowners with older roofs may want a policy that has a schedule for your roof based on its age. Instead of paying for a brand new roof, a policy with a <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">roof surfacing replacement endorsement</a> pays a specific percentage of what your roof is worth based on its age. This can save you a lot in premium, but it does mean you get less money if your roof is damaged. Again, the key is figuring out what you can afford and weighing it against what amount of risk you’re comfortable with.</p>\n<p>We should note that the Florida Senate Bill 2D prohibits insurers from refusing to insure or renew a homeowner’s policy with a roof that is less than 15 years old solely based on its age. If your roof is at least 15 years old and your insurer requires you to replace your roof before it will issue or renew your policy, then you’re allowed to pay for a roof inspection. If that inspection reveals your roof has 5 or more years of useful life left in it, then your insurer cannot deny coverage based on your roof’s age.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shoparound\">Shop around</h2>\n<p>One common misconception about home insurance is that policies are all the same. What you buy from Insurance Company A varies little from Insurance Company B, so it doesn’t really matter which policy you choose.</p>\n<p>But as our CEO pointed out during the AMA, insurance companies all have different algorithms they use to price and quantify risk. As a result, premiums, and what you get for them, can vary quite a bit, so it just makes good sense to look at several companies before you decide. Just remember that when you <a href=\"/blog/how-to-compare-home-insurance/\">compare home insurance policies</a>, you want to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium.</li>\n<li>Coverage limits.</li>\n<li>What’s covered.</li>\n<li>What’s not covered.</li>\n<li>Claims processes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/reviews/\">Customer reviews</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also apply this tip to the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a house</a>. Most people know that you want to look at several homes before you make an offer, but we think you should also keep insurance in mind as you shop.</p>\n<p>New homes are typically less expensive to insure because they’re more likely to meet modern building codes. Plus, owners of newer homes often benefit from innovations in construction methods and building materials.</p>\n<p>Focusing your location more inland means you’ll find more homes that haven’t been as adversely impacted by extreme weather as those closer to the water. And narrowing your search even further by avoiding high risk flood zones can also help you control your overall home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>Seeing your home insurance rates go up year after year can be incredibly frustrating, but there are things you can do now to help you take control of those costs. Whether you make updates to your home, adjust your coverages, or shop for a new insurer, you can be better equipped to weather the storm until reforms improve the situation.</p>"

    body: "<p>Maintaining the basics in your life right now is probably top of mind, and you’re not alone. Most folks are wondering exactly how stay-at-home-orders will play out financially and affect necessities and household bills such as home insurance.</p>\n<p>It’s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html\">47 million people</a> will lose their jobs or be furloughed during the <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-coronavirus/\">coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the US could see an unemployment rate of at least 32 percent.</p>\n<p>With those projections on the horizon, will <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> be impacted? Some variables could affect costs, payments, and claims down the road. Here’s our take.</p>\n<h2 id=\"willcovid19raisehomeinsurancepremiums\">Will COVID-19 Raise Home Insurance Premiums?</h2>\n<p>We haven’t seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic in our lifetimes, so we can’t model how this pandemic will affect home insurance premiums (yet). The closest comparison is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-pandemic-history.htm\">1918 flu pandemic</a> that infected one-third of the world’s population – about 500 million people – and killed more than 50 million people (675,000 in the United States).</p>\n<p>But remember, in 1918, we didn’t have flu vaccines, antibiotics to control secondary infections, or pharmaceuticals to help. Science has come a long way since then, and we are in a much stronger position to combat the disease.</p>\n<p>That’s a long way of saying, in the immediate future, that could actually mean less risk from a home insurance standpoint. Most folks are at home if they are able, which reduces some risks. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer break-ins and burglaries may occur because many people are at home.</li>\n<li>Homeowners can address incidents like bursting pipes faster.</li>\n<li>Fewer liability claims may occur because people aren’t visiting each other’s homes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, the temporary dip in risk likely won’t reduce home insurance premiums in the long term.</p>\n<p>There’s also the flip side: pandemic stress that spurs an economic recession could lead to more insurance fraud, which tends to drive up insurance rates. Some studies show <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/nz/news/breaking-news/why-does-insurance-fraud-increase-during-a-recession-236772.aspx\">insurance fraud rises during economic downturns</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s also the chance of civil unrest during uncertain times. While most homeowners policies cover damages and losses from civil unrest, an increase in these types of claims could mean premium increases.</p>\n<p>Again, all of this is conjecture. Only time will give us the information we need to analyze the pandemic’s impact on the industry at large.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoescoronavirusaffecthomeownersinsurancepayments\">How Does Coronavirus Affect Homeowners Insurance Payments?</h2>\n<p>If you’re a homeowner who has experienced financial hardship because of the pandemic, you may have concerns about making payments for bills like your mortgage and insurance.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you should know.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/03/25/562263.htm\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> has asked all states to implement continuity plans for consumers. Every state is addressing the pandemic slightly different, so it’s important to look at specifics where you live. For example, California is offering a 60-day deferral for premium payments – no one can be canceled for non-payment during this period.</p>\n<p>For those concerned about making payments, reach out to your insurer and ask about your options. Most carriers, including Kin, are willing to work with you during this time if you’re experiencing hardship. We’re all in this together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwillhomeinsuranceinspectionsbehandledwhileshelteringathome\">How Will Home Insurance Inspections Be Handled While Sheltering at Home?</h2>\n<p>If you need to buy home insurance right now, whether you’ve just bought a new home or you’re shopping for a better policy, you might need to have a home inspection as a condition of the policy.</p>\n<p>Understandably, you probably don’t want to break safer-at-home mandates to have an inspection done in your home. Luckily, carriers like Kin offer “self-serve inspections.” All you need is a smartphone to take photos of your home.</p>\n<p>Exterior-only inspections may also be an option during this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwillclaimsbeprocessedduringthepandemic\">How Will Claims Be Processed during the Pandemic?</h2>\n<p>Life happens even in extraordinary times. So while we hope you don’t <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">experience a claim</a>, know that you won’t be left in the lurch if you need to draw on your coverage during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>As soon as you experience damage, do what you can to mitigate the damage (e.g., shut off the water if your pipe bursts), and call us. We offer <a href=\"/claims/\">virtual inspections</a> to limit the people in your home and to speed up processing. Essential workers like plumbers are still able to work, and we will help you sort out next steps to get your covered repairs underway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcanhomeownersdotosaveonhomeinsurancerightnow\">What Can Homeowners Do to Save on Home Insurance Right Now?</h2>\n<p>Many Americans may experience financial duress because of the coronavirus pandemic. To put yourself in a good position to save money on home insurance, you might consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shopping around for a new policy.</strong> Take the time to see if your current insurance is the best possible price. Many homeowners don’t realize that the insurance recommended by their real estate agent or mortgage lender isn’t always the best priced policy. Those policies that you started with may not even provide added coverage such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. We’ve found the homeowners who switched to Kin save an average of $500 a year.</li>\n<li><strong>Making your home safer.</strong> Things like water leak detection devices, smart home security systems, and fire alarms can reduce your home’s risk exposures. By investing in things that make your home safer, you are reducing the risk of loss and become eligible for homeowners insurance discounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing your deductible.</strong> Higher deductibles reduce premiums because your insurer will pay out less for covered claims. Just make sure you only take on a deductible you could comfortably spare with little notice. See if moving from a $500 to $1,000 deductible will make a difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking about discounts.</strong> Every company offers <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> – make sure you get as many as you’re eligible for. Ask us about discounts when you get a quote.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s hard to know what the future holds, but one thing is certain: taking care of your health and your family is just as important as it’s ever been. Take comfort where you can find it. Control what you can to make your home safer. Ask for help when you need it. We’re just a phone call away: <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for doing your part to <a href=\"/blog/work-from-home-tips/\">help flatten the curve</a>.</p>"

Unfortunately, housing prices are soaring this year, and that’s making it difficult for house hunters to find the home of their dreams.</p>\n<p>If <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a home in a seller’s market</a> seems impossible, then maybe it’s time to think about remodeling. You may find that an updated kitchen or an additional bathroom makes all the difference in your home. Even better, remodeling often increases your home’s value, which can come in handy when you do finally sell.</p>\n<p>However, some of the issues that are driving up home prices, such as supply chain issues and inflation, also impact the cost of home improvement projects. We took a look at the price tag for popular renovations so you can plan a realistic budget for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourkitchen\">Remodeling Your Kitchen</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-project-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>The median price for remodeling a kitchen is $12,000.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2021--US-Houzz-and-Home-Study.pdf\">Houzz & Home survey</a>, kitchen renovations are some of the most popular upgrades, accounting for 27 percent of interior home improvement projects in 2021. As with most remodels and renovations, the cost depends on the size of the undertaking. You could spend just a few thousand dollars to replace your cabinets or $100,000 to make your kitchen into a dream cooking space. That said, the median price is $12,000, but homeowners with kitchens larger than 200 square feet spent 14 percent more for major overhauls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourmasterbathroom\">Remodeling Your Master Bathroom</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-project-master-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Remodeling larger bathrooms ends up costing more.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>For many homeowners, their master bathroom is their oasis, making it another popular room to renovate. But even when the space is small, remodeling it can be expensive. The median price tag is $8,000, but bathrooms over 100 square feet went up dramatically. Those costs homeowners around $18,000 for a complete remodel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourguestbathroom\">Remodeling Your Guest Bathroom</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-project-guest-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Homeowners spent a median $3,200 on remodeling their guest bathrooms.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>The Houzz survey revealed that 25 percent of homeowners chose to renovate their guest bathrooms rather than their master bathrooms. Price could be a big factor here, as the median cost is just $3,200. And spending on high traffic areas can mean more impact for less money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installinghardwoodfloors\">Installing Hardwood Floors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-project-floor.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Installing hardwood floors costs up to $4,000 per 200 square feet.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Noncarpet flooring is a popular choice with many homeowners. Thirty-eight percent of them purchased it compared to just 14 percent who chose carpet for their homes. While this can seem like an easy project, it can be a significant and costly undertaking. Hardwood flooring can cost from $2,400 to $4,000 for every 200 square feet to install, so you may want to consider an alternative, like engineered wood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automatinghomesystems\">Automating Home Systems</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-improvements-tech.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Smart automation systems can help you save on energy costs.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Not all home improvement projects focus on cosmetics. For example, using smart technology to automate your home’s thermostat, sprinklers, and lighting is a growing trend. The median cost is just $400, but some of what you spend may come back to you as you save on energy costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradingyourplumbing\">Upgrading Your Plumbing</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-improvements-plumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <p align=\"center\"><i><small>The average homeowner spends $1,175 to upgrade their plumbing.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>The cost of most home improvements depends at least partially on your ambitions, and this may be particularly true when you want to upgrade your plumbing. Repiping an entire house can cost up to $15,000, depending on the type of plumbing pipe you want, while replacing a portion might only cost $360. The national average, however, is <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/plumbing/install-new-plumbing-pipes/\">$1,174</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradingyourelectrical\">Upgrading Your Electrical</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-improvements-electric.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Upgrading electrical panels may cost as much as $4,000.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Your home’s electrical systems may also need upgrading. In fact, homeowners with <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a> may find themselves ineligible for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Replacing these panels can cost between <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/electrical/upgrade-an-electrical-panel/\">$500 and $4,000</a>, but other jobs, like installing under-cabinet lighting, often cost less.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paintingyourhomesexterior\">Painting Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cost-of-home-improvements-paint.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>A fresh coat of paint typically costs between $1,000 and $7,000</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Painting your home’s exterior not only helps protect it from the elements, but it’s an easy way to <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">boost your curb appeal</a>. The cost of painting the outside of a house is based largely on the number of stories and square footage and can range from $1,000 to $7,000.

    body: "<p>Let’s be real: no one wants to pay more for insurance than they have to.</p>\n<p>And for most of our customers, saving on insurance is not just a matter of convenience or preference – it’s a matter of making homeownership in the state sustainable. Florida continues to outrank the rest of the country for <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">highest home insurance rates</a>. It comes second only to Louisiana for highest prices paid for coverage, and its rates keep increasing. (Check out our guide for a more comprehensive look at <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a> throughout the country.)</p>\n<p>As of last quarter, several prominent Florida insurance companies <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2020/02/25/559166.htm\">filed for “staggering” rate increases</a>, some as high as 36.5 percent. You can imagine the strain that would put on anyone’s budget, nonetheless homeowners who are already paying top dollar for coverage.</p>\n<p>This is a long way of saying: we take our mission to help homeowners save money on insurance seriously. And according to our latest Customer Savings Survey, we’re delivering on our promise – and more.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what the data shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdocustomerssaveonaveragewithkin\">How Much Do Customers Save on Average with Kin?</h2>\n<p>Based on survey responses from 2018 - 2020, our customers save $604 on average when they switch to Kin.</p>\n<p>For 2020 alone, we’ve helped our customers save $574 on average, and we anticipate that number will increase before the year's through. Compared to other Florida insurance companies, we are 15 percent cheaper on average. <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">Learn more about how we stack up to the competition</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownerschoosekin\">Why Do Homeowners Choose Kin?</h2>\n<p>We’re always curious about what brings customers to our door, and our survey shows that price is (unsurprisingly) the biggest motivator, with better service coming in second. Here’s the full breakdown.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Why%20Do%20Homeowners%20Switch%20to%20Kin.png?width=964&name=Why%20Do%20Homeowners%20Switch%20to%20Kin.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We’re not surprised that better service and ease are big driving factors in purchasing decisions. Usually, getting homeowners insurance means going to an agency, answering a bunch of complicated questions about your home, and waiting (sometimes for days!) to get a quote.</p>\n<p>We know homeowners insurance is supposed to be a digital product – you can’t exactly hold insurance in your hands, can you? – and that allows us to simplify the experience. Most customers can get a quote and buy online in minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wouldhomeownersrecommendkintoafriend\">Would Homeowners Recommend Kin to a Friend?</h2>\n<p>Our survey also shows we're surpassing every other insurance company in customer satisfaction. We ask every customer how likely they are to recommend us to a friend to measure our Net Promoter Score, and the results are impressive.</p>\n<p>Our latest results show we have an NPS score of 84, well beyond the average of 35 for the home insurance industry. Whereas most folks wouldn't recommend their insurance company to someone they care about, our customers seem eager to share their experience.</p>\n<p>Here's a snapshot of how our NPS compares to national insurance companies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/nps-chart-1.png?width=1844&name=nps-chart-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thetakeaway\">The Takeaway</h2>\n<p>We hope this peek behind the curtains proves that you don’t have to choose between saving money and enjoying excellent service from your insurance company. But don’t take our word for it. Let our customers – who’ve left us more than <a href=\"/reviews/\">1,700 reviews on Trustpilot</a> – do the talking.</p>"

Deck Your Doorways</h2>\n<p>Tabletops, stair railings, and mantles almost always get decorated. But you can lift a room’s holiday vibe by decking the doorways, too. Add inexpensive string lights to door frames to make them sparkle – extra credit for finding lights shaped like stars or snowflakes!</p>\n<h2 id=\"3changeupyourornaments\">3. Change Up Your Ornaments</h2>\n<p>Create your own tree ornaments with pine cones you find in your backyard or around your neighborhood. Keep them natural or spray paint them metallic gold, attach a small looped piece of string to the top with hot glue, and you're set! This is a fun activity for children (with supervision, of course!) and may even become a <a href=\"/blog/holiday-traditions-to-try-this-year/\">new holiday tradition</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4addgreenerytoyourmantle\">4. Add Greenery to Your Mantle</h2>\n<p>Between candlesticks and stockings, fireplace mantles can get a little overloaded with <a href=\"https://porch.com/advice/store-seasonal-decor-like-pro\">holiday decor</a>. Keep things subtle by laying long green pine boughs along the mantle with ribbons that match your <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design aesthetic</a>. This can tie together the overall look of your room.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5replaceyourtreeskirtwithaplanter\">5. Replace Your Tree Skirt with a Planter</h2>\n<p>The purpose of a tree skirt is to hide your tree stand, but that’s not the only option you have. Instead, kick it up a notch with a planter. You’ll still need your tree stand, but baskets and boxes can hide it just as well – as long as you find one that has a flat bottom and is wide enough for your stand. A true DIYer may want to decorate a cardboard box as a present and use that to hide their tree stand.</p>\n<p>Just make sure you can still water the tree if you have a real one! Dried out <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">Christmas trees can be a fire hazard</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6createauniqueholidayscene\">6. Create a Unique Holiday Scene</h2>\n<p>Collectibles that create a holiday scene on your mantle have been around for years now. Create your own unique display with figurines that are important to you, whether that’s action figures, nutcracker dolls, or other items you’ve accumulated over the years. Simply use boxes to create different levels, white batting to simulate snow, and then place your figurines in whatever positions amuse you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7pickacolorscheme\">7. Pick a Color Scheme</h2>\n<p>Choosing two or three colors for your holiday decor goes a long way toward making your home look polished. This is true even if you’re drawn to colors not usually associated with winter holidays (hot pink, anyone?). Stick with your chosen colors – from gifts and ornaments to table linens and throw pillows – to create a cohesive and memorable palette.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8rethinkyourflowerarrangements\">8. Rethink Your Flower Arrangements</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to arrange flowers is to drop them in a lovely vase and leave them be. (This includes poinsettias, which often get left in the green planters they come in.) However, you might try clipping blooms and placing them in low glass dishes. You can even do that with poinsettia bracts – just be sure to burn the ends. This keeps the sap from oozing out and helps them live longer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9useevergreensandglass\">9. Use Evergreens and Glass</h2>\n<p>Glass containers can make anything look elegant. Place evergreen sprigs in glass containers of different shapes and sizes, such as candle holders and decanters, and then set them in various places throughout your home. This simple holiday home decorating idea is an easy and inexpensive way to make any space feel more festive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10makebottlebrushtrees\">10. Make Bottle Brush Trees</h2>\n<p>This is an activity your children will love! You can <a href=\"https://www.smilemercantile.com/blogs/tutorials/how-to-make-sisal-bottle-brush-trees-from-scratch-diy-craft-tutorial\">make your own bottle brush trees</a> using sisal fiber, floral wire, cork, and clothespins, or buy them pre-made and paint or dye them all sorts of fun colors. (You have to bleach the sisal fiber if you dye them, so you may want to do that step before your kids get involved.) You can use these as holiday decor on their own, but they could make an excellent addition to a holiday scene on your mantle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11updateyourwreath\">11. Update Your Wreath</h2>\n<p>Wreaths don’t have to be made from evergreen boughs. Instead, make them out of items that mean something to you, like family photos or materials that fit your decor, and then hang them throughout your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12hangyourstockingswithcare\">12. Hang Your Stockings with Care</h2>\n<p>Even without a fireplace, you can still make sure your stockings are hung with care. Just find a space with enough ledge to put a stocking holder on, like a bookshelf, kitchen island, or window frame. To make the area stand out, decorate it with other holiday items to create a festive tableau.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13accentyourchandelier\">13. Accent Your Chandelier</h2>\n<p>Your chandelier is already a focal point, so why not decorate it with berry garlands, paper dreidels, or colored ribbons? This can be the perfect accent for holiday dinner parties, but make sure your decoration don't touch the lights. No sense in risking a fire for style and charm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14addextrashimmertoyourcelebration\">14. Add Extra Shimmer to Your Celebration</h2>\n<p>Few things look more beautiful than candlelight, and you can create more sparkle with a few well-placed mirrors. Adding reflective surfaces to your mantle, bookcase, or even your tablescape can increase the delicate glow of the candles for a peaceful effect. Just be sure to keep your candles away from flammable items like fabric or paper, and never leave them burning while unattended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15decoratewithcandy\">15. Decorate with Candy</h2>\n<p>Whatever your tradition, holiday-themed treats can be a fun way to celebrate. Filling glass jars with Hanukkah gelt or using <a href=\"https://thegardeningcook.com/diy-candy-cane-vase/\">candy canes to decorate a vase</a> is a great way to add some whimsy to your holiday decor.</p>"

    body: "<p>There's a lot to love about homeownership. But what happens when you're ready for a change of scenery? Moving on a whim isn't an option for most people, but redecorating can help ensure you continue loving your space, even as your taste changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoredecorateyourhomeonabudget\">How to redecorate your home on a budget</h2>\n<p>The conventional wisdom in home decoration is to spend on the big stuff and save on the small stuff. This isn’t something we’re here to refute – it’s great advice. Because spending money can be stressful, we’ll start by outlining areas where you can save on home decor.</p>\n<p>Once you’re on a roll, we’ll hit you with five more recommendations and convince you to purchase original artwork. (Think about it.)</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a new homeowner or you’ve been settled for years, decorating is a good opportunity to reassess your assets and exposures. As you decorate, we recommend updating <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">your home inventory</a> and documenting any changes as you go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/#where-to-save-the-small-stuff\">Where to Save</a> | <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/#where-to-splurge-the-big-stuff\">Where to Splurge</a> | <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/#parting-advice-for-the-home-decorator\">Tips for the Home Decorator</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretosavethesmallstuff\">Where to save: The small stuff</h2>\n<p>When it comes to furniture like a couch or a mattress, it’s easy to justify the spend. You’ll rest on these pieces more than anywhere else, even if you’re a triathlete. For coffee tables and smaller, trendy accents, we’ve pulled together a few tried-and-true strategies for saving.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home-decor-4.jpg?width=986&name=home-decor-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"1upcycle\">1. Upcycle</h3>\n<p>Also called “creative reuse.” You can upcycle at many different levels – it can be as simple as repurposing plain vases from the florist as part of a seasonal display.</p>\n<p>Or you can get fancy: you can finally make use of the old shutter sitting in the garage to display your niece’s art and holiday cards. You can turn over an old wicker wastebasket and make it a side table! <a href=\"https://www.upcyclethat.com/\">Upcycle That</a> is a helpful resource for digging in at whatever level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2paint\">2. Paint</h3>\n<p>A fresh coat of paint is an affordable way to spruce things up, especially in high-traffic areas of the house. For example, if you're sick of the old color, go lighter and brighter. Yellow is a popular indoor color for a reason.</p>\n<p>Paint your wooden chairs! Paint them different colors! This may not sound like your usual aesthetic, but it can add dimension to your color palette (and it’s much cheaper than buying new chairs). Or paint your ceiling and pretend you're in Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Two cautions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t forget to clean the walls and <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/painting-the-kitchen-1822118\">prep before you paint the kitchen</a> or the front hall.</li>\n<li>Don’t be too thrifty when you select your paint. While changing the color of a room is a budget-friendly way to change the look of an entire space, we don’t recommend skimping on the quality of the paint you buy. This applies to brushes and tools as well. Do not pick up the cheapest roller on the shelf – the lousy felt will make lousy trails across your wall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3trythemirrortrick\">3. Try the mirror trick</h3>\n<p>Want more natural light in a room? Add a mirror instead of investing in a new hole in your wall. Place your mirrors across from windows for maximum impact. We’ve all heard this advice before, and that’s because it’s an effective way to create the illusion of open space and abundant light.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to save money, mirrors are one of the best items to pick up second-hand. Head to garage or estate sales with measurements, and you should be able to find a few interesting vintage options.</p>\n<p>Mirrors don’t have to be heavy, framed pieces to be effective. An affordable panel set in the back of a bookshelf can do wonders for a room without calling attention to itself. (It may, however, inspire you to dust more proactively.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"4replacelightfixturesaddaccentlighting\">4. Replace light fixtures &amp; add accent lighting</h3>\n<p>Even swapping out a lampshade will impact a room by changing the color and the tone of the light. Lamps are also great to buy used, but be sure to test any secondhand fixtures with a working bulb and outlet before purchase.</p>\n<p>In addition to adding table lamps, consider a few small spotlights, strategically placed to highlight art or beloved plants. These can add dimension to a room.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/storage.jpg?width=1000&name=storage.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"5saveonfunctionalormultifunctionalitems\">5. Save on functional or multifunctional items</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking to fill white space on a bedroom wall and you need a place to hang your party dresses, a row of hooks may be the solution.</p>\n<p>Multifunctional items are another great way to save. If you're looking for seating and storage in a bedroom or living area, you may need an ottoman more than a used trunk and a chair. If the upholstery happens to match your new duvet cover, all the better!</p>\n<h3 id=\"6rearrangethefurniture\">6. Rearrange the furniture</h3>\n<p>This may not require spending any money at all, but it will take some physical effort, a little imagination, and a measuring tape. If you’re not sure where to begin, consider choosing a new focal point for the room. Instead of the window, is there a mirror or wall hanging that could serve a center for your new arrangement?</p>\n<p>Look for ways to open the space for new uses. Have you been looking for a clear stretch of floor where you can lay down your yoga mat? Keep this functional goal in mind and see how this impacts where you put your furniture.</p>\n<p>If one poorly placed outlet has been stopping you from moving your bed to the wall across from your bedroom window, consider purchasing an extension cord. It’s worth an extra ten dollars to get a longer or higher-quality cord to hide against the baseboard. Find a way to work around whatever obstacle has been keeping you from making this small change. It will have a big impact on how you live in your space.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7getintoplants\">7. Get into plants</h3>\n<p>Houseplants are a great way to add dynamic decoration. Hanging plants in the windows draws attention to the outdoors, even on a cloudy day.</p>\n<p>If your window treatments will allow, consider plants that will climb across a trellis, including one that might crawl across a curtain rod.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">a beginner plant owner</a> or an expert, the most affordable way to get more plants is to cultivate self-propagating clippings (succulents and spider plants are great at this).</p>\n<p>Plants grow year round, but they tend to go on sale in September in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cabinet-doors-1.jpg?width=1000&name=cabinet-doors-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"8removethecabinetdoors\">8. Remove the cabinet doors</h3>\n<p>While you may consider refinishing or painting your cabinets, one of the biggest changes to a kitchen that comes at the lowest cost is removing the cabinet doors and reorganizing their contents.</p>\n<p>You may want to lay down some contact paper to freshen them up, but otherwise this spruce is nearly free.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretosplurgethebigstuff\">Where to splurge: The big stuff</h2>\n<p>Before you embark on a splurge, we recommend making sure the fundamentals of your house are in order. If you’re weighing home maintenance against the big stuff you want to buy, check out our <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re embarking on a remodel, consider a few tweaks to your insurance to make sure you have appropriate coverage throughout construction and after.</p>\n<p>Investigating how to furnish your home on a budget will yield many blogs posts with links to coupons and tips, but the most important factor may be when you shop. There is a retail season for everything, and most industries have sales twice a year – we’ll includes notes on these throughout.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home-decor-6.jpg?width=1000&name=home-decor-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"1floors\">1. Floors</h3>\n<p>If your floors are in good shape, invest in a beautiful area rug. Take care of it and keep it clean. Even if you have wall-to-wall carpeting, you can add an area rug. <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/advice/saving-money/what-month-to-make-the-purchase/\">The best time to buy area rugs is in January</a>. If your floors have seen better days, you have two main options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redo the hardwood floors that are hiding under the old carpet.</strong> This is a major undertaking, but it will have a significant impact on the look and feel of your home. There’s no substitute. For a task of this scope, you may want to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hire a good contractor</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider installing new carpet or hardwood flooring.</strong> There are, of course, other flooring options, but we’re writing this from a cold state in winter where tile floors sound unappealing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2walls\">2. Walls</h3>\n<p>You have a few options to spruce up your walls when you're ready to spend a little money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Original art</strong>. If you really want something beautiful that you’ll have forever, consider investing in original art. Check out local galleries and show schedules, as this is an industry that doesn’t adhere to an international calendar. Also, local art schools that have master's shows can be a great place to shop without breaking the bank. If you do acquire an early masterpiece, you may want to <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled it</a> on your home insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Window treatments.</strong> Beautiful drapes are not passé. Investing in some beautiful fabric and a custom valance can accentuate the height of a room.</li>\n<li><strong>Shades.</strong> They can help to <a href=\"/blog/prep-your-home-for-winter/\">winterize your home</a>. The amount of light you let in impacts everything from the color of the walls in the afternoon to where you’ll choose to position your favorite reading chair.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/new-couch.jpg?width=1000&name=new-couch.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"3livingroom\">3. Living room</h3>\n<p>If you’re sick of the print on your furniture, we have two splurge solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in a custom slipcover. Why custom? Pre-made slipcovers are often disappointing. If your furniture is still in good shape, but you’re looking for a change, a slipcover or outright reupholstery may be worth the spend.</li>\n<li>Get a new couch. It’s important. It’s inevitable. As with your mattress, there comes a point at which you must invest in a new place to rest while you watch Netflix. <a href=\"https://www.payoff.com/life/money/when-is-the-best-time-to-buy-furniture/\">They typically go on sale in August and February</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4diningroom\">4. Dining room</h3>\n<p>Perhaps you’ve successfully hidden the worst gouges in your IKEA tabletop with a seasonally appropriate runner for years. Perhaps you inherited an over-polished cherry piece from your great aunt that takes up the whole room. Dining room tables rarely break, so replacing yours might never feel urgent, but it may be time.</p>\n<p>When you’re ready, here are a few questions to guide your purchase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Size: Are you looking to go bigger or smaller?</li>\n<li>Shape: Are you ready to swap out your round table for a rectangle?</li>\n<li>Position: If your table is centered in your dining area, consider how this impacts how you’re using the space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like much of the furniture industry, the deals cycle around in August and February.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5kitchen\">5. Kitchen</h3>\n<p>Here are two ways to give your kitchen an entirely new look without breaking the bank:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install a backsplash</strong>. This may be the least necessary place to redecorate, but if you’re looking to splurge and you have the money around, updating your backsplash can be an awesome, impactful way to change up your kitchen.</li>\n<li><strong>Redo the cabinets and countertop</strong>. Cabinets add valuable storage to a room full of gadgets. The design of your countertop and kitchen can add functional space for cooking with your family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the last item on our splurge list because these changes can be wildly expensive, even at a basic level. If you’re just starting to think about replacing this piece of your kitchen, we recommend <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/countertops/buying-guide/index.htm\">the comprehensive guide to buying a new countertop</a> from Consumer Reports.</p>\n<h2 id=\"partingadviceforthehomedecorator\">Parting advice for the home decorator</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home-decor-7.jpg?width=1000&name=home-decor-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Ready to get started? We have a few more tips to set you on the right path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan as much as possible</strong>. Have a vision, or develop one along the way. If at the end of this list, you find yourself wondering where to start, make a list of things you want to remove, replace, or acquire. Any level of planning is better than none, especially if you’re on a budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Be decisive</strong>. Decisions you waffle over show at the seams: there’s usually a concrete reason that slipcover gave you pause. Maybe the green paisley really <em>does</em> look like a bunch of aggressive turtles. Go with your gut and trust yourself to know what you want your space to look like.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your insurance when you’re finished</strong>. The property portion of your homeowners insurance covers the contents of your home for their specific value. If you made any major adjustments (or acquired any valuables like original art), you’ll want to check to see if your policy still covers you – and if not, to update it so it does.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy decorating!</p>"

    body: "<p>If you live in California, chances are good that you’ve heard the term “defensible space” in the last few years.</p>\n<p>And if you live in a <a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/more/fire-safety-laws/\">state responsibility area</a>, you’re likely aware that you are required to follow state laws for maintaining defensible space around your home.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll explain what defensible space is, how homeowners can maintain it with landscaping and other planning, and what its limits are. You should walk away with a clear idea of how to create defensible space around your home and where you can turn for further information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisdefensiblespace\">What Is Defensible Space?</h2>\n<p>Defensible space is a way for <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/rmrs_2004_barkeley_y001.pdf\">California homeowners</a> in the West.</p>\n<p>This means that, as with other destructive natural weather patterns, like <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">hurricanes and tornadoes</a>, homeowners who face wildfire risks must take steps to protect themselves and their property.</p>\n<p>Maintaining defensible space is one of those steps. Defensible space is a barrier around a home that has two goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To prevent wildfires (and other fires) from reaching the house.</li>\n<li>To give firefighters a safe buffer zone where they can fight fires near the house.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These two goals are related, of course: when it’s easier for firefighters to do their job, there’s a lower chance that a fire will reach your house. Then again, for fast-moving fires, you can’t always expect firefighters to arrive in time. In these situations, the defensible space itself may be enough to keep embers from igniting your home.</p>\n<p>Defensible space itself generally consists of two zones, which form concentric circles around your house (and other relevant structures, like a garage). Collectively, the two zones create a <a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\">100-foot barrier around your home</a>. Here’s a little more information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zone 1 is between 30 and 50 feet wide</strong>. In this zone, homeowners should eliminate dead plants, plant matter, leaves, and needles from the yard and gutters. Trees should be trimmed so that they’re at least 10 feet away from other trees and so that no branches overhang your roof or chimney. Large fuel sources (wood piles, propane tanks, etc.) should be moved out of Zone 1. Generally, there should be plenty of space between flammable vegetation and your house, deck, patio, porch, or garage.</li>\n<li><strong>Zone 2 is between 50 and 70 feet wide</strong>. In this zone, homeowners should keep grasses no higher than four inches and eliminate “ladder” plants – i.e., plants close enough together to transfer fire. That means creating both vertical and horizontal space between plants. Remove flammable plant matter from this zone, too (leaves, bark, pinecones, branches, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figure 1 illustrates what Zone 1 and Zone 2 of defensible space might look like. Figure 2 illustrates what vertical spacing for plants might look like.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/defensible-space-zone.jpg?width=600&name=defensible-space-zone.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1 (</em><a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\"><em>Source</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/vertical-space.png?width=624&name=vertical-space.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 2 (</em><a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\"><em>Source</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n<p>Worth noting: since 2008, new homes built in high fire-risk areas in California have had to meet fire-resistance criteria. It outlines which materials homes should be constructed with to minimize the likelihood that wildfires will ignite the property.</p>\n<p>For example, metal screens are more fire resistant than fiberglass screens; slate roofs are more fire-resistant than shake or shingle roofs; and composite decks and porches are more fire resistant than those made from wood (obviously).</p>\n<h2 id=\"defensiblespacecurbappeal\">Defensible Space &amp; Curb Appeal</h2>\n<p>There’s a myth that creating defensible space around your home will tank its curb appeal. Luckily, that’s only a myth.</p>\n<p>In reality, the same defensible space that can protect your home and family from wildfires can also look beautiful to you and prospective buyers, if you decide to sell. See Figure 3 for an example of a home with defensible space landscaping that looks quite lovely.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/defensible-space-landscaping.jpg?width=600&name=defensible-space-landscaping.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 3 (</em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/oregondepartmentofforestry/14179765885/in/photostream/\"><em>Source</em></a><em>)</em></p>\n<p>So how can you create a functional and aesthetically pleasing 100-foot border of defensible space around your home? Follow these landscaping tips and you should have no problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landscapingfordefensiblespace\">Landscaping for Defensible Space</h2>\n<p>First, a caveat: California is a big state, so best practices will vary a little based on where you live. But generally speaking, the following rules can help homeowners create defensible space around their homes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjust for hills</strong>: If land slopes down from your home, know that your fire risk is greater and you may have to create a larger area of defensible space. Fires can reach uphill fuel (like dry plants) more easily, which means fire burns faster uphill. Plus, steeper hills increase the speed of the fire, which also increases its heat and intensity.</li>\n<li><strong>Think about prevailing winds</strong>: Fires typically follow prevailing winds, so familiarize yourself with how winds blow near you. Be sure to leave an extra cushion of defensible space on the windy side of your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Create space between plants</strong>: When plants are too close together, they make it easy for fire to spread. This is why it’s important to leave both horizontal and vertical space between plants in your landscape.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose the right plants</strong>: Trees with low resin or sap content burn less easily than those with higher contents. Plants like succulents with a high water content don’t ignite as easily as dry grasses. Generally, native plants tend to work better than non-native plants (more on the best plants for defensible space below). It’s also important to choose plants with deep roots, which will help prevent erosion after a fire, even if the tops of the plants are burned.</li>\n<li><strong>Include non-plant landscaping elements</strong>: Stone or rock walkways create both visual interest and a natural firebreak. Other stone and rock elements can both break up your plants and minimize your yard’s fire risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choosing the right plants can have a big impact on the effectiveness of your defensible space, so it’s worth spelling out which plants tend to work best to minimize fire risk. Here’s a breakdown.</p>\n<p>| Plant Type | Examples | Suitable for defensible space landscaping? |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fire-resistant groundcover plants | Ornamental strawberry | Yes |\n| Ignition-resistant plants | Rockrose, ice plant, aloe | Yes |\n| Fire-resistant shrubs | Hedging roses, bush honeysuckles, currant, cotoneaster, sumac, shrub apples, California redbud | Yes |\n| Conifers | Pine, fir, cedar, juniper, redwood, spruce, yew, larch | NO |\n| Low-resin trees | Hardwoods like maple, poplar, and cherry | Yes |\n| Drought-resistant native plants | Red monkey flower, California fuchsia, California lilac | Yes |</p>\n<p>Note: the best plants for your yard will also depend on your region. For detailed guidance on which plants to use in your yard to create defensible space, consult with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A local plant nursery or garden store.</li>\n<li>A local landscape contractor.</li>\n<li>A representative from <a href=\"https://ucanr.edu/About/Locations/\">your local UC Cooperative Extension</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"maintainingyourdefensiblespacelandscape\">Maintaining Your Defensible Space Landscape</h2>\n<p>In addition to adding the right plants to your homestead, you also have to remove plants and plant matter that could contribute to the spread of flames. One easy way to do that is by hiring a herd of goats to clear out your land.</p>\n<p>That’s right, goats.</p>\n<p>We talked to Scott Morris, co-founder of San Diego-based 805 Goats, about how bringing goats to your home can make the job of maintaining defensible space easier.</p>\n<p>First of all, he noted, “They’re great for hilly terrain.”</p>\n<p>If your land is mostly flat, it’s probably cheaper and faster to hire a human landscaping crew to clear away unwanted brush and debris. But if you have a hilly property, goats are likely the more economical choice (Morris estimated that his goats would cost about 30 percent less than contractors, but he also acknowledged that every property is different).</p>\n<p>“They’re also quiet,” Morris said. “Oh, and they love poison oak and poison ivy. That’s a preferred vegetation for them. Those plants are like ice cream for goats.”</p>\n<p>That’s important for homeowners with these poisonous plants on their properties: many landscaping companies won’t send workers out to remove those plants because contact with their oils can leave employees unable to work for weeks. And if you don’t feel like exposing yourself to the plants by clearing them yourself, goats are probably a good bet.</p>\n<p>We also asked about rose bushes and other plants homeowners may not want goats nibbling on. Morris reassured us that they have a plan for that.</p>\n<p>“We keep goats in the intended area by putting up a portable fence,” he explained. “The day before, we cut a fence line and put up a fence around the area where the goat herd will work. Then we move the fence as the goats work through the vegetation.”</p>\n<p>Intrigued? Check out <a href=\"https://www.805goats.com/\">805Goats.com</a> if you’re in the San Diego area, or do a quick search for landscaping goat herds near you if you live elsewhere in the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thelimitsofdefensiblespace\">The Limits of Defensible Space</h2>\n<p>Defensible space is a crucial part of wildfire readiness in California, and maintaining defensible space is the law in many areas.</p>\n<p>But it’s also important to acknowledge that there are limits to what defensible space can do. While it can reduce the likelihood that your house will burn in a wildfire, it is not 100 percent effective. Sometimes, even the best-maintained homesteads will burn.</p>\n<p>We reached out to Chris Schnepf, the researcher whose work we quoted earlier, to ask whether he thought the current wildfire situation in California was a “new normal,” and if so, what that meant for homeowners.</p>\n<p>“Fire is still fire,” he said. “But fire seasons are getting longer, and we still have a backlog of fuel accumulations to deal with in many regions of the West.”</p>\n<p>He went on to say that, “Regarding homeowners, it’s more important than ever for their homes to be prepared to reduce ignition likelihood, especially from the larger fires that send lots of embers ahead of them.”</p>\n<p>So vigilance remains important. And part of that vigilance is preparing for the worst-case scenario – that is, the times that your defensible space doesn’t prevent the spread of flames. In those situations, the <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> included in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can help you rebuild and recover after the loss of your home.</p>"

Their goal is to facilitate the purchase of insurance with one of the carriers they represent.</p>\n<p>A critical benefit of working with an agent is that they can bind an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">insurance policy</a> for you. This means that you can get coverage by making the down payment of the policy while the policy is still being finalized in underwriting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"typesofinsuranceagents\">Types of insurance agents</h3>\n<p>Some agents represent only one carrier. These agents are referred to as “captive” agents because they only write policies for one carrier. Agents that are free to write policies for multiple carriers are referred to as “independent” agents.</p>\n<p>Since captive insurance agents only work for one company, they may have a greater understanding of the products offered because they are only expected to know what that specific company has. However, they are limited to only selling in that domain.</p>\n<p>Independent agents must know multiple companies' products, and that can result in greater flexibility and ability to compare policies. In fact, independent agents are often confused with insurance brokers because they can try to sell policies from any of the carriers they are affiliated with. Independent agents may not have as in-depth knowledge about a specific carrier’s insurance product, but they can shop between carriers to try to get a better rate for their client.</p>\n<p>All insurance agents get paid a commission for placing a policy with an insurance carrier. They do not charge additional fees like a broker can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesaninsurancebrokerdo\">What does an insurance broker do?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_616228190.jpg?width=300&name=shutterstock_616228190.jpg\" alt=\"An insurance broker on the phone, reviewing a file\" /></p>\n<p>Like an insurance agent, an insurance broker is an intermediary between the insurance buyer and the insurance company, representing the buyer.</p>\n<p>Insurance brokers cannot bind insurance policies. This means that they can only take the application and submit it to the insurance company. You don’t have coverage until the insurance company approves the application. Brokers operate by soliciting business from buyers and submitting their completed applications to the insurer. This may be a critical difference between agents and brokers if you need to get coverage quickly for a home purchase or mortgage application.</p>\n<p>Insurance brokers get paid a commission by the insurance company it places the policy with and may also charge a broker’s fee for shopping the policy around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"typesofinsurancebrokers\">Types of insurance brokers</h3>\n<p>An insurance broker can either operate by <em>retail or wholesale</em>. A <em>retail broker</em> generally deals directly with the customer to get them insurance and is more common than a wholesale broker. When you work with a retail broker, they will usually request quotes for you from different insurance companies to find you the best policy or the best price or both.</p>\n<p>However, not every policy can be handled by a retail broker. In instances where standard coverage is not available, like if you were trying to insure a <a href=\"/blog/high-value-home-insurance/\">high-value home</a> or a particularly risky property, the torch is passed to a <em>wholesale broker</em> whose line of work is more specialized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoifindanagentorbroker\">How do I find an agent or broker?</h2>\n<p>When you are buying a home, your real estate agent will usually connect you with their insurance agent or broker of choice. It often makes sense to explore this connection; your agent likely has a good feel for the local market, and they typically send you to people who they’ve had good experiences with before.</p>\n<p>However, you may want to do your research and ask neighbors. It can be too forward to ask for rates, but checking to see if they’ve had a positive experience can provide an unbiased option for review. You may also want to read <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kin.com\">reviews of home insurance companies</a> as well agents and brokers, too.</p>\n<p>The important thing is to be confident in the relationship that you have with your agent or broker, and to be confident that you have the right coverage for your home at a price that suits your needs and leaves you covered for the biggest risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directtoconsumerinsurancecompanies\">Direct-to-consumer insurance companies</h2>\n<p>Our model is a little bit different than traditional insurers.

    body: "<p>Whether you rent or own, one of the eight dwelling-based home insurance policies can help protect you from disaster. Make sure you have the right policy, based on your lifestyle, possessions, and tolerance for risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepolicyforms\">Home Insurance Policy Forms</h2>\n<p>HO1 - Basic Form: It is, as the name suggests, basic. So basic, in fact, that it is slowly becoming obsolete. It covers so few risks that mortgage companies won't accept them as a guarantee that they'll recoup payment in the event of a total loss. They typically only cover <strong>named perils</strong>, which are exactly what it sounds like: fire, smoke, lightning, and other events that the insurance carrier is able to name in advance.</p>\n<p>If you read our post on the <a href=\"/blog/six-essential-home-insurance-coverages/\">different components of a home insurance policy</a>, then you'll know that this omits some pretty common coverage. The most worrisome exclusion, from a homeowner's perspective, is personal liability. This means that if someone is injured on your property, you're on your own to cover damages.</p>\n<p>A cousin of the HO1 is the HO2. This is called a Broad Form policy, and covers more named perils than the HO1, but still does not cover anything else. While this policy covers things like falling objects, weight of snow, ice, and sleet, or damage caused by faulty household systems and pipes, it does not include any coverage for personal liability.</p>\n<p>An HO3 policy, or Special Form, is the most common type of home insurance in the country. This covers all of the named perils in an HO1 and HO2, but layers on many other types of coverage. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unnamed Perils - This includes things that aren't specifically written into your policy. For example, if your neighbor loses his glasses and accidentally drives into your garage door, that's covered.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use Insurance</a> - An HO1 or HO2 would pay for your home to be rebuilt if your home burns down, but where will you stay? That's the sort of thing that's covered by Loss of Use Insurance. Personal costs that arises as a result of being unable to use your home is covered by Loss of Use Insurance.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability Insurance</a> - This covers damages that result, on or off your property, as a result of your actions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments Insurance</a> - This covers medical payments for third parties in the event of an injury on the insured location. If your cocker spaniel gets fussy and bites your daughter's friend, the trip to the emergency room would likely be covered by this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only policy in this list that doesn't cover homeowners, the HO4 is more commonly known as renters insurance. In industry terminology, it's the \"tenant's form.\" This is similar to a home insurance policy, with the coverage for structures removed. Your personal property is covered, and typically there's some personal liability coverage as well.</p>\n<p>An HO3 on steroids, the HO5 is known as the Comprehensive Form, and it's appropriate. This policy covers more perils, and typically at higher limits. As such, this is typically only offered on newer homes.</p>\n<p>We should note that there are many perils that aren't covered by any of policies we've talked about so far. These include, but are not limited to: earthquakes, landslides, floods, acts of terrorism, and neglect. Each of those policies can typically be purchased separately, aside from neglect.</p>\n<p>An HO6 is condo insurance, and is a combination of renter's insurance (HO4) and the immediate structure surrounding the domicile - the unit's floors, walls, and ceiling. The condo association needs a commercial policy that covers all common areas and external structures.</p>\n<p>Mobile homes are covered by the HO7. The protection is similar to an HO3, but the nature of the risk is understandably different. Having a structure that's not attached to the ground is riskier, especially in areas prone to <a href=\"/flood-insurance\">floods</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, or tornados. As a result, many carriers will not cover this risk. At this time, we're unable to cover mobile homes.</p>\n<p>Finally, an HO8 policy covers older homes, or homes that are particularly difficult to replace. It's similar to an HO1 or HO2 in the sense that it only covers named perils, so make sure to be aware of what's covered and what's not in your policy.</p>\n<p>For all of the above policies it's important to understand what's covered, and how you'll be paid back for your claim in the event of a loss. The former requires you to understand what perils and accidents you'll get compensated for, while the latter is about replacement cost and actual cash value. If your policy covers your structure and property to replacement cost, you'll get an amount equal to the cost of a new version of the lost item. If it's only actual cash value, you'll get the current value. This means that if you need to replace something that depreciates in value (like electronics), you'll be paying mostly out-of-pocket.</p>\n<p>Check out our guide on <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">types of homeowners insurance</a> to learn more.</p>"

For example, Floridians may plan for hurricanes and floods, Californians may plan for wildfires and earthquakes, and Midwesterners may plan for tornadoes.</p>\n<p>If you need some guidance about your area’s biggest risks, ask your insurance company.</p>\n<p>Some of the most common disasters to plan for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hurricanes</li>\n<li>Floods</li>\n<li>Sinkholes</li>\n<li>Tornadoes or waterspouts</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/brief-history-of-wildfires/\">Wildfires</a></li>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mapping out a plan for these events could make all the difference in getting you and loved ones to safety in time. Once you know what to expect, follow these steps to document your plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1outlinesafetymeasurestotakebeforeadisaster\">1. Outline safety measures to take before a disaster</h2>\n<p>For every type of emergency you may face, outline steps you need to take before it happens. For example, in any disaster, know where you and your family need to go. Other action items may be specific to the disaster. Here are some pointers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodshurricanes\">Floods &amp; hurricanes</h3>\n<p>Depending on the type of <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood</a>, you may have some warning. Flash flood warnings or news flashes may alert you to rising water from storm surges or an overflowing creek. If you have time, pack valuables and take them with you. What can’t come with you should be moved to higher ground or placed on counters. Never leave pets behind if you expect floodwaters or hurricanes to hit your home.</p>\n<p>Plan for hurricane winds, too. Store patio furniture, outdoor decor, and hanging planters – these can easily become projectiles when lifted by high winds. Fill your bathtub with water before the storm hits in case water lines are shut off or damaged. You can use it to flush toilets. And if you have hurricane shutters, get them in place. Learn more about <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">how to prepare for a hurricane</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n<p>There’s usually not enough time to evacuate before an earthquake, so you’ll often need to shelter in place. Be prepared to drop, cover, and hold on to what you can. Evaluate your home or workplace and designate a spot that’s far from windows and that has something you can shelter under, like a table or desk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wildfires\">Wildfires</h3>\n<p>Many who have lost <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">homes in wildfires</a> say that they come on so fast that you only have minutes to react. If you live in a wildfire zone, plan on how you will get your family and pets out quickly and safely. Pay attention to wildfire conditions during hot summer days and always be aware of your surroundings. Know that when you must leave, you won’t have time to pack anything. Having a go-bag by the door or in your car can help make sure you have your essentials when you need them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tornadoes\">Tornadoes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornadoes</a> often happen with only moments to spare. If you live in an area prone to tornadoes, know where to shelter – usually a basement or a bathroom. Avoid exterior rooms, especially those with a lot of windows. If you’re able, get under something sturdy like a heavy table or workbench, and cover your body with a blanket to protect yourself from shattered glass.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2understandwhentoshelterinplacewhentoevacuate\">2. Understand when to shelter in place &amp; when to evacuate</h2>\n<p>When safe, local authorities and rescue workers may advise you to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Planning_Considerations_Evacuation_and_Shelter-in-Place.pdf\">shelter in place</a>. Sheltering in place means that you have enough food and water resources to stay in your home and hunker down through the disaster.</p>\n<p>Some life-threatening disasters may call for a <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">mandatory evacuation</a>. In these cases, rescue workers may have to leave the area for their own safety, too, and can’t respond to distress calls if you stay. You may also need to evacuate after a disaster. For example, if an earthquake damages the structure of your home, it won’t be safe to shelter in place.</p>\n<p>When evacuating, don’t leave your pets behind! They need you in times of upheaval more than ever. Bring a disaster kit with essentials such as food, water, toiletries, medicine, pet supplies, and basic emergency equipment like flashlights, batteries, and first aid kits. You probably have most of these items in your home – putting them in one bag that you can grab before you head out will ensure you have your essentials.</p>\n<p>If you must leave, make sure everyone in your household knows where they’re supposed to go. This is your <strong>designated emergency meetup</strong>. It can be an aunt’s house out of town, a school, or a shelter. All that matters is that everyone knows about it so if you’re separated, you have a plan to find each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3knowwhotocontact\">3. Know who to contact</h2>\n<p>Your state often provides emergency assistance in the form of shelters, recovery programs, and mass care. The specifics vary based on where you live, but it’s helpful to know where to turn after a major disaster when you need reliable information.</p>\n<p>In Florida, the <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/dem/about-the-division/\">Division of Emergency Management</a> is a great post-storm resource. It acts as a liaison between local and federal agencies to coordinate recovery efforts, and it maintains the <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/information-line/\">State Assistance Information Line (SAIL)</a>. The SAIL hotline is <a href=\"tel:1-800-342-3557\">1-800-342-3557</a>, and its operators can help guide Florida residents on road closures and alternate routes, available shelters in impacted counties, shelters designed for special needs patients, hotels and motels that accept pets, boaters instructions for moving watercraft to safer ground, and re-entry information once it is safe to return to the affected area.</p>\n<p>California’s Office of Emergency Services manages the state’s emergency evacuation routes, mass care and shelter programs, recovery programs, and emergency repatriation. You can <a href=\"http://www.calalerts.org/\">sign up for emergency alerts here</a> for notices about earthquakes and other emergencies. The alerts will also let you know about evacuation orders and warnings.</p>\n<p>Your contact list should also include family members to let them know you’re safe. That way, rescue workers know to spend their resources searching for folks who are missing.

    body: "<p>Any insurance professional will tell you that having insurance does not provide protection against things going wrong. And when something inevitably <em>does</em> go wrong, a person’s disaster preparedness will affect outcomes at least as much as their insurance policies.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we decided to check in with how Americans are doing on the disaster preparedness front, specifically as it relates to the kinds of risks that affect homeowners. To do that, we looked at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html?s_areas=00000&s_year=2017&s_tablename=TABLES06&s_bygroup1=15&s_bygroup2=12&s_filtergroup1=2&s_filtergroup2=1\">US Census data</a> that examines disaster preparedness for all occupied units in the country.</p>\n<p><em>(Note: while the full US Census is conducted only once every 10 years, this disaster preparedness data is updated more often; the most recent data available, which we used, is from 2017.)</em></p>\n<p>Here, we’ll take a look at how Americans are doing overall, highlight a few differences by age group, and offer some tips for creating a disaster preparedness plan. Our findings are focused on 10 aspects of disaster preparedness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a generator</li>\n<li>Having enough nonperishable food to last the household for three days</li>\n<li>Having at least three gallons of bottled water per person</li>\n<li>Having a household communication plan if cell service is disrupted</li>\n<li>Having an agreed-upon meeting location</li>\n<li>Having an emergency evacuation kit</li>\n<li>Having access to vital financial information</li>\n<li>Having evacuation funds up to $2,000</li>\n<li>Availability of an evacuation vehicle</li>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Flood insurance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wherewerestrongondisasterpreparedness\">Where we’re strong on disaster preparedness</h2>\n<p>We live in a big country, and the disaster risks vary from one region to another. Because we didn’t break our data down geographically, we focused on preparation measures that offer universal benefits. Let’s start by looking at where we’re doing best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"foodwater\">Food &amp; water</h3>\n<p>Collectively, Americans are pretty good at having enough nonperishable food in the house: about 85% of us have enough to last the household for three days, and that number doesn’t fluctuate much by age group.</p>\n<p>We could be better about bottled water, though: while 62% of Americans overall have adequate bottled water on hand, younger groups perform worse on this metric (see Figure 1).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Adequate%20Bottled%20Water%20Supply%20by%20Age%20Group.svg\" alt=\"\" /><em>Figure 1</em></p>\n<p>The bad news is that even in the best-performing age groups, only about two-thirds of Americans have adequate water supplies for a disaster. The good news: bottled water is relatively cheap and easy to come by. Even better, it doesn’t expire, so by stocking up now, you can check something off your disaster preparedness to-do list and not worry about it moving forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"accesstofinancialdocuments\">Access to financial documents</h3>\n<p>Another area of strength for the nation’s disaster preparedness plans: access to important financial information. Overall, 83% of Americans note that they can easily access financial docs in the event of a disaster, and no group falls below 80%.</p>\n<p>The nation’s youngest homeowners deserve a special shout out, though: 91% of homeowners ages 25 to 29 have easy access to these documents (see Figure 2).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Easy%20Access%20to%20Financial%20Documents%20by%20Age.svg\" alt=\"\" /><em>Figure 2</em></p>\n<p>If you’re among the 20% or so of Americans without an easy way to get to your financial records, consider setting up a cloud storage system that you can access from any desktop or mobile device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evacuationvehicle\">Evacuation vehicle</h3>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly in a country of drivers, about 96% of Americans have a vehicle they could use to evacuate in the event of a disaster. The only group notably lower than that is those aged 75 and older, where access to a vehicle came in at 92%.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to argue with numbers that strong, so we’ll highlight two takeaways in the event of a disaster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to have spare gas on hand, especially during hurricane, tornado, or <a href=\"/blog/brief-history-of-wildfires/\">wildfire</a> season (or whatever disasters threaten your area of the country).</li>\n<li>If you have friends, neighbors, or family who are 75 or older, be sure to check in on them when evacuation orders are in place to make sure they have a way to get to safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"disasterpreparednessgrayareas\">Disaster preparedness gray areas</h2>\n<p>Not all the numbers told a clear story. Two items we looked out stood out as being less obviously either a win or an area for improvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"generatorownership\">Generator ownership</h3>\n<p>Only about 22% of Americans have a generator; however, it’s hard to know whether that’s a problematically low number. Generators are less common among younger homeowners (only 8% of those 25 to 29 and 13% of those 30 to 34 have one), so it’s possible that this is somewhat self-selective: those who see a greater need for a generator are more likely to have one.</p>\n<p>We’re inferring this in part because older Americans are more likely to have health-related reasons for investing in a generator, while younger homeowners may be more willing to wait out a power outage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evacuationfunds\">Evacuation funds</h3>\n<p>At first glance, the numbers for having adequate funds to evacuate in the event of a disaster seem strong: 86% of Americans have “up to $2,000” to evacuate a distance of 50 miles.</p>\n<p>But the wording of that question leaves some room for doubt: “up to” $2,000 means a fund could be well under that figure. Still, the wording of the question suggests that most Americans are confident that they have enough cash on hand to get themselves to safety in event of a disaster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disasterpreparednessareastoimprove\">Disaster preparedness areas to improve</h2>\n<p>Now for the areas of disaster preparedness where we’re not doing as well. The good news for these is that they’re fairly easy to fix. And for the most part, doing so is also inexpensive. Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emergencycommunicationsplan\">Emergency communications plan</h3>\n<p>In the event that cell service goes down, only 26% of us – that’s about one in four – have a plan for getting in touch with our loved ones. And even among the most prepared age groups, only 30% have a plan (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Emergency%20Communication%20Plan%20by%20Age.svg\" alt=\"\" /><em>Figure 3</em></p>\n<p>So how can you make an emergency communication plan? Set aside an hour or so to follow <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Family_Comm_Plan_508_20150820.pdf\">these tips from FEMA</a>: write down contact information for members of your family and important outside parties (e.g., your doctor’s office). And remember that if cell service is spotty, a text is more likely to go through than a call, because the former uses less bandwidth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emergencymeetupplan\">Emergency meetup plan</h3>\n<p>Only 38% of American households with two or more people have an agreed-upon meetup location in the event of a disaster. As with the emergency communications plan, even the top-performing age groups aren’t cracking the 50% mark (see Figure 4).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Agreed-Upon%20Meeting%20Place%20by%20Age.svg\" alt=\"\" /><em>Figure 4</em></p>\n<p>The good news is that deciding on a meetup spot is the kind of disaster preparedness you can do in just a few minutes of discussion. When you choose your location, be sure to take into account how easy it is to reach from where you and other members of your family are likely to be during the day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evacuationkit\">Evacuation kit</h3>\n<p>Slightly more of us have evacuation kits than emergency meetup plans, which is great! Still, though, only slightly more than half of Americans (55%) have such a kit ready.</p>\n<p>That number is fairly consistent across age groups, meaning close to half of us should put stocking an evacuation kit on our to-do lists. What should go in the kit? FEMA’s <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/kit\">Ready.gov recommends including</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>A flashlight</li>\n<li>A radio and NOAA weather radio with tone alerts</li>\n<li>A first aid kit</li>\n<li>Batteries</li>\n<li>A whistle</li>\n<li>Dust masks</li>\n<li>Plastic sheeting</li>\n<li>Duct tape</li>\n<li>Moist towelettes</li>\n<li>Garbage bags</li>\n<li>Plastic ties</li>\n<li>A wrench or pliers</li>\n<li>A manual can opener</li>\n<li>Local maps</li>\n<li>A cell phone with chargers and a backup battery</li>\n<li>Non-prescription health and wellness supplies (painkillers, contact solution, etc.)</li>\n<li>Prescription medicines (though you’ll have to keep these up to date)</li>\n<li>Cash</li>\n<li>… and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the items in an emergency kit need to be replaced to ensure they’ll work when you need them. If you haven’t already, add creating (or updating) your kit to your annual list of <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance chores</a> to make sure you stay on top of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodinsurance\">Flood insurance</h3>\n<p>Across age groups, only about 11% of homeowners have flood insurance. This, despite the fact that FEMA’s official position is that <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">anywhere it can rain, it can flood</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s true that only some homeowners are required by their mortgage lender to carry flood insurance, it’s also true that standard homeowners insurance does not include coverage for flood damage. In the event of a flood disaster, those without a dedicated flood policy will likely have to cover the cost of repairs out of pocket.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the 89% of Americans who don't have a flood insurance policy, read up on what it can do for you – especially if you live somewhere that gets heavy rain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingyourselfupforsuccess\">Setting yourself up for success</h2>\n<p>Nobody likes to think about what will happen in the event of a disaster. But having a plan in place can make a major difference in how your life unfolds when the disaster is over. In some cases, it might even save your life, the lives of your loved ones, or the life of your pet.</p>\n<p>And while your insurance policy can help you rebuild after a disaster strikes, nothing can replace a disaster preparedness plan for helping you weather the storm – whatever type it is.</p>"

    body: "<p>Splitting up is hard. It's even harder when you own a home together.</p>\n<p>Deciding how to handle a joint financial agreement like a mortgage in the midst of this process can make a divorce feel even more complicated.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how to keep your house, whether you’ll have to refinance, or how to remove your spouse from the mortgage after the divorce. The answers to these questions aren’t straightforward. But it may help to frame your mortgage as a project to resolve that’s separate from your divorce because, really, it is.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage loan agreement is a legally binding contract separate from any divorce agreement. Even in an amicable divorce, if both of your names are on the mortgage, your lender has to agree to any changes to the mortgage document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetoutofasharedmortgage\">How to get out of a shared mortgage</h2>\n<p>There are three basic ways out of a shared mortgage in the event of a divorce:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sell</strong>. Close out the mortgage by selling the house, then split what’s left as part of the divorce agreement.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick one owner</strong>. One spouse keeps the house and refinances to get the other off the mortgage. (It’s usually not possible for the party who stays to assume the existing mortgage – more on that below.)</li>\n<li><strong>Hold</strong>. If financial circumstances prevent you from making a change right away, you may opt to share the house temporarily while you wait for better financial conditions. Even as your divorce moves forward, you’re not required to make any changes to the mortgage until one of you is in a position to refinance on your own or the house sells.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s look at the logistics of updating your mortgage (and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>), and run through the most common mortgage arrangements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even in an amicable divorce, if both of your names are on the mortgage, your lender has to agree to any changes to the mortgage document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"removingaspousefromamortgageafterdivorce\">Removing a spouse from a mortgage after divorce</h2>\n<p>If you own a home with your spouse, it’s likely that both of you are on the mortgage and on the title deed. Make sure both are updated after your divorce, however you choose to proceed.</p>\n<p>Here are some options for how to handle the mortgage after a divorce.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option1sellthehouseandsplitwhatsleft\">Option 1: Sell the house and split what’s left</h3>\n<p>Identify who is staying in the house and who is leaving. Before you apply to refinance after a divorce, you’ll need to know if the person who’s staying is 100 percent responsible for the mortgage and whether there will be alimony.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to get a <a href=\"https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/when-to-use-a-quitclaim-deed\">quitclaim deed</a> to remove your former spouse from the title. (Your homeowners insurance company will want a copy of this as well.)</p>\n<p>Until your refinance agreement is final, the person who’s leaving the house isn’t released from the liability of the mortgage and will need to stay on the insurance policy until they have been removed from the mortgage agreement.</p>\n<p>With the proceeds from selling the property, you can repay the loan you took out (your mortgage), and split any money left over with your former spouse. Goodbye, shared mortgage!</p>\n<p>In this case and the next, be ready to pay <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">capital gains tax</a> on any income from the sale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option2buytheotherout\">Option 2: Buy the other out</h3>\n<p>It’s common in divorce for one spouse to try to buy the other out and take 100 percent ownership of the house. In this case, the person who will remain on the title would get a quitclaim deed and write a check for the agreed-upon equity. (And, of course, update the home’s insurance policy accordingly.)</p>\n<p>Refinancing may or may not make sense for you based on a number of factors at the time of your divorce, including current interest rates, your individual credit score, and how far into your mortgage you are. If you’re within the first two or three years of paying off your mortgage, you’ll approach this differently than if you’re in year 10 of a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Refinancing 10 years in may mean that your payment goes down significantly each month, whereas it’s likely to go up if you’re in the first two years and still mostly paying off interest. Your homeowners insurance payments may also increase significantly, as you’ll be the only one liable for the property.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option3keepthemortgageasisfornow\">Option 3: Keep the mortgage as is for now</h3>\n<p>In this scenario, both spouses stay on the mortgage, though one may move out of the house. This may happen if neither spouse has the financial wherewithal to assume the mortgage independently.</p>\n<p>Things are more complicated when both spouses stay on the mortgage for an interim period after the divorce. In the event that your former spouse who is no longer living in the house stops making payments, language in a divorce decree outlining their financial obligations can be difficult to enforce. And delinquency or late payments impact everyone’s credit score.</p>\n<p>Still, if neither of you qualifies to refinance independently (as you’d need to do to assume the mortgage), you may want to hold where you are. If you opt to live with the mortgage as is, you’ll both need to stay on the homeowners insurance as part of the mortgage loan agreement.</p>\n<p>If both parties stay on temporarily, the divorce agreement will typically define a certain amount of time in which one or both parties must get their income, credit, or rate qualifications within range for refinancing or a buy-out.</p>\n<p>In this case, you’ll need to maintain your <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a>, as major changes are likely to occur if one party moves out and scheduled items change hands. You’ll also want to do your best to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">avoid homeowners insurance claims</a> while you await a resolution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option4assumethemortgage\">Option 4: Assume the mortgage</h3>\n<p>You may be wondering why it isn’t possible for one party to <a href=\"https://pocketsense.com/can-assume-mortgage-after-divorce-3502.html\">assume full responsibility for the existing mortgage</a> after a divorce. The answer is that this <em>may</em> be an option, but most mortgages are not assumable and the fees involved can be high. If you are interested in more information, contact your mortgage lender directly to ask if you are eligible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option5nomortgagenoproblemprobably\">Option 5: No mortgage, no problem (probably)</h3>\n<p>Of course, in situations in which there’s no mortgage and you own your property outright, the transfer of property in a divorce is much simpler – it’s just a transfer of ownership. The sole owner will need a deed recorded to remove the former spouse. They’ll also need to contact the insurance company to update their home insurance policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nomattertheoptionprotectyourselffromliability\">No matter the option, protect yourself from liability</h2>\n<p>Untangling yourself from a shared mortgage can be complicated. But that doesn’t mean you can’t approach this head-on. (Though you may need to seek legal counsel at some point.)</p>\n<p>To get insight on how to approach this process, we spoke with mortgage expert Neda Mohammadi, the director of national sales operations at <a href=\"https://www.lend.us/\">LendUS</a>. Mohammadi is also a loan advisor, and she offered up a credo for those going through a divorce: “Stay current.”</p>\n<p>What she means by this is, “always stay current on your liabilities.” No matter who is living in the house or responsible for paying, as long as both of your names are on the mortgage, don’t let your mortgage fall behind.</p>\n<p>“As soon as you fall behind, you’ll limit your ability to get other financing for 12 to 24 months,“ she said, which means you won’t have the opportunity to buy a new home.</p>\n<p>“The same thing goes for property taxes,” she added. “Delinquency or penalties start adding on. This gets very costly the longer it goes on. It gets very hard to catch up.” And this can hinder everyone’s financial future and the speed of divorce proceedings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenindoubtgetcounsel\">When in doubt, get counsel</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, there are many options for refinancing to remove your former spouse from your mortgage. You should start by speaking with your divorce lawyer or by reaching out to your lender directly to find out more about their process for applying for changes.</p>\n<p>Modifying a mortgage is rarely swift or cheap; you will encounter fees throughout this process, and they may be significant. But in the end, with the right help, you may end up with a better monthly payment for your new budget.</p>\n<p>Even in an amicable divorce, do not rely on your former partner to make financial decisions or keep up mortgage payments. Whether or not you’re the one keeping the house in the divorce, protect yourself to ward off legal trouble down the road.</p>"

    body: "<p>Forgoing home inspections before buying a home is becoming more and more common, especially in hot real estate markets. Buyers may offer to buy as-is and waive their inspection to sweeten a bid on a home. But that strategy is not without risk. Homebuyers are then responsible to <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">make repairs to the home</a> on their own.</p>\n<p>Even if you had an inspection before you bought the home, houses require maintenance. By knowing what to look for, you may save yourself thousands in damage and repair costs by catching a problem before it gets out of hand.</p>\n<p>Learn how to spot check your home for minor issues before they become big problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toolsyouneedtoinspectyourhomeforminordamage\">Tools You Need to Inspect Your Home for Minor Damage</h2>\n<p>To do a DIY home inspection, you may want to make sure you have the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Binoculars</li>\n<li>Flashlight</li>\n<li>Gloves</li>\n<li>Protective eyewear</li>\n<li>Notepad and pen</li>\n<li>Camera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you examine your property, be sure to take notes and photos. That way you can document and keep an eye on possible problem areas.</p>\n<p>Ready to get started?</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspecttheattic\">Inspect the Attic</h2>\n<p>An attic is one of the first places you want to check for poor ventilation, water damage, and openings. Open the hatch and take a look around without walking into the attic. Do you see sunlight coming through the attic (and not through a window)? If so, this is a good sign that your roof has a hole and may cause a leak. Damaged wood and rusted nails are also signs of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> and a possible roof leak.</p>\n<p>If your soffit (lower roof) intake is obstructed by insulation, that may be a sign of poor ventilation. Keep an eye out for black mold – this must be removed ASAP because it is toxic.</p>\n<p>Remember to leave walking in the attic to the professionals – it’s very easy to fall through if you don’t know where to step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspectthehomesexterior\">Inspect the Home's Exterior</h2>\n<p>Grab those binoculars! With these puppies, you can scan the roofline, high walls, and chimney without the extra danger of a hike up the roof. Primarily, you’re looking for symmetry, alignment, and obstructions when you examine the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gutters and downspouts</strong>. Cracks, clogged elbows, and debris in the gutter may contribute to damaged foundation. These problems may keep water from draining away from the foundation like it’s supposed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Siding</strong>. Peeling, cracking, and fading paint may indicate surface deterioration and signal it’s time to hire a professional to replace the siding.</li>\n<li><strong>Chimney</strong>. Are pigeons roosting in your chimney? Congratulations on the new pet, but leaves or bird nests can block chimney ventilation. Be sure to look for cracks in the bricks and mortar skirting the chimney – you don’t want water to seep in.</li>\n<li><strong>Roof</strong>. Curling, cracked, and missing shingles are a good sign that your roof needs a repair or replacement (especially if it’s 25 years or older). Be especially vigilant for a roof that sags. That issue requires immediate expert attention.</li>\n<li><strong>Foundation</strong>. The grade around the foundation should be 8 inches below the siding. Watch out for cracks that are both horizontal and vertical, or ones that are growing. Take photos to keep track of the cracks. If they grow, hire a pro!</li>\n<li><strong>Driveway and garage</strong>. Watch out for loose and cracking asphalt, which may indicate current or future problems with the foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows</strong>. Rotting, peeling caulk can let in unwanted water and air. Repair this right away.</li>\n<li><strong>Decks, stairs, and porches</strong>. Cracked boards and missing screws may signal termite damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"inspectthehomesinterior\">Inspect the Home's Interior</h2>\n<p>Get your flashlight ready. It’s time to take a look inside your home and inspect the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Walls and ceilings</strong>. Look out for mildew, usually recognizable by dark, blotchy stains. Brown ring stains may indicate a broken pipe.</li>\n<li><strong>Kitchen backsplash and counter</strong>. Catch dripping water behind counter space and cabinets. Look for an open space with leakage before it causes more damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tub surround</strong>. Check for loose or cracked bathroom tiles to avoid water in the walls.</li>\n<li><strong>Service panel</strong>. Rusty or scorched electric shorts are a hazard. If you see these, immediately call an electrician. If the wiring is spliced and outside the electrical box, call a licensed professional at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Joists</strong>. Joists with pencil-thick coiling around them could indicate termites. Call the exterminator before these pests cause structural damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety alarms</strong>. Make sure every bedroom has a smoke and carbon monoxide <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">alarm</a>. Test these alarms monthly to make sure they are in working order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your DIY inspection can help you catch problems before they snowball into bigger, more expensive repairs. When you spot a problem, call the appropriate specialist to handle it. Trying to make a repair that is outside your comfort zone or expertise may only add to the problem and jeopardize your safety.</p>"

    body: "<p>Your credit score <em>can</em> affect your home insurance rate, but how that works varies by where you live and who your insurer is. Some states, such as Florida, use credit scores when determining your home insurance premiums. While most people understand that insurance companies use credit, the majority of people don’t know how or why companies use it. Gaining insight on this can help you improve what insurance companies call your credit-based insurance (CBI) score, leading to better rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesyourcreditscoreaffectyourhomeinsurancerates\">How Does Your Credit Score Affect Your Home Insurance Rates?</h2>\n<p>Before we can explain how your credit score impacts your homeowners insurance premium, we have to define our terms. The credit score you may be thinking of ﹘the one that represents your credit risk ﹘ is not what we’re discussing here. That’s your Fair Isaac Corporation Score (FICO). Instead, we’re looking at your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">insurance score</a>, also called a credit-based insurance score (CBI).</p>\n<p>Both your FICO credit score and your CBI are based on information found in your credit report. However, insurance companies connect certain details in your credit history to your insurance risk, and that gives them an idea of how likely you are to file a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim</a> on your policy.</p>\n<p>Only seven states allow insurers to use your credit history to help determine your insurance rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California</li>\n<li>Hawaii</li>\n<li>Maryland</li>\n<li>Massachusetts</li>\n<li>Michigan</li>\n<li>Oregon</li>\n<li>Utah</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note that your credit score is only one of many factors that <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">impact your home insurance premium</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"factorsthatimpactinsurancescores\">Factors That Impact Insurance Scores</h3>\n<p>Every insurance company has its own method for calculating your insurance score. However, most consider these factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length of credit history.</strong> A longer credit history is usually looked on favorably, but what’s considered “long” can vary by insurer.</li>\n<li><strong>Bank and credit accounts.</strong> Having several accounts in good standing is usually a positive, but any accounts in collections typically have a negative impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Late payments.</strong> Fewer (or no) late payments is better for your insurance score.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit mix.</strong> Insurance companies often evaluate the types of debt you carry, such as student, auto, and <a href=\"/glossary/home-loan/\">home loans</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit applications.</strong> Applying for credit from multiple places can negatively impact your insurance score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the only details from your credit history that insurers may consider when determining your home insurance rates. Moreover, insurance companies weigh each component differently, so your CBI from one may not match what others assign to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownersinsurancecompaniesusecreditscores\">Why Do Homeowners Insurance Companies Use Credit Scores?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance companies use your credit history to determine your insurance score, and ultimately, your home insurance rates because they’ve found a correlation between creditworthiness and claims. By evaluating how a homeowner manages their finances, insurers can make reasonable calculations about how well the person takes care of their home. And when someone maintains their house, they’re less likely to file serious claims.</p>\n<p>But you should also know that insurance scores help reduce personal bias in the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a>. Every state has laws the prohibit insurance companies discriminating against consumers. However, if an underwriter didn’t have enough information, they sometimes had to go with their gut. Insurance scores allow underwriters to identify bad risks while minimizing the need for personal judgements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoimproveyourcreditscores\">How to Improve Your Credit Scores</h2>\n<p>Because your credit impacts so many aspects of your financial life, including insurance, it makes sense to keep your score as high as possible. Some simple ways to improve your credit score include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contesting inaccurate information on your credit report.</li>\n<li>Paying down revolving credit.</li>\n<li>Keep old credit accounts open, especially if they have a balance.</li>\n<li>Making a plan to pay off delinquent accounts.</li>\n<li>Paying your bills on time.</li>\n<li>Consolidating your debt for a better interest rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, you might not see much difference in your insurance score if you move from an average to a good credit score. But a poor credit score can have a big impact on your home insurance rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettinginsurancequotesdoesntaffectyourcreditscore\">Getting Insurance Quotes Doesn’t Affect Your Credit Score</h2>\n<p>People often worry about hard inquiries, the times a lender checks their credit history, impacting their overall credit score. That’s not a problem with insurance quotes because insurers make a soft inquiry, much like a utility company might make. You can <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get an insurance quote</a> anytime you want and not be concerned with your credit score getting dinged.</p>"

    body: "<p>A wise man once said “Don’t ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.” But even if you follow that sage advice, your fence may still come down, which might make you wonder “Does home insurance cover a fallen fence?”</p>\n<p>The answer, as usual, is it depends on what caused your fence to fall and the particulars of your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>To be clear, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> typically covers fences and walls. This protection is found in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures coverage</a>, also called Coverage B. However, every policy is different, which means you also have to consider your policy’s language and coverage limits. Plus, most policies have a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard deductible</a> that needs to be met before coverage kicks in.</p>\n<p>All of that said, let’s take a look at some common situations that may cause your fence to fall to see what’s typically covered by home insurance. These can give you an idea of how coverage usually works, but you should still read your policy or talk to your agent about your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windstormblowsyourfenceover\">Windstorm blows your fence over</h2>\n<p>Our first scenario is your fence being blown over by a windstorm. In most instances, homeowners insurance covers wind damage, even when it has named-peril coverage, like an <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 policy</a>. So in the case of a windstorm, your fallen fence is likely covered.</p>\n<p>However, some homeowners may have different deductibles for wind damage, especially if they live in areas prone to hurricanes or tornadoes, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> that applies to damage caused by a named storm.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a> that applies to damage caused by wind, hail, tornado, or similar events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we said, home insurance typically covers windstorms, so most policies include tornado and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance coverage</a>. People who have these separate deductibles simply have a different financial obligation for specific types of storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atreefallsonyourfence\">A tree falls on your fence</h2>\n<p>When a tree falls on your fence, then the question is really whose home insurance policy pays for the damage. Take a look at a few different situations:</p>\n<h3 id=\"yourtreefallsonyourfence\">Your tree falls on your fence</h3>\n<p>If your tree is healthy but somehow falls on your fence and damages it, then your homeowners policy likely covers the damage. However, if your neglect or failure to maintain it causes your tree to fall, then your claim may be denied.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yourneighborstreefallsonyourfence\">Your neighbor’s tree falls on your fence</h3>\n<p>This one gets a little complicated. Let’s start with a neighbor who neglects their trees to the point that it falls on your fence. In that case, you could probably file a claim on your neighbor’s home insurance. The same goes for damage caused by a neighbor who is pruning their trees. If you file that claim on your policy, then your insurer may look to get compensated by your neighbor’s insurance company.</p>\n<p>But what if a giant wind or heavy snow causes your neighbor's tree to fall on your fence? That’s often a claim for your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>You should also note that some states consider trees on property lines to be both property owners’ responsibility – which means both you and your neighbor could end up bearing the cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acarcrashesintoyourfence\">A car crashes into your fence</h2>\n<p>A car careening through your fence may seem unlikely, but it does happen. When it does, it’s pretty alarming. This situation can be covered by either your home insurance or by the driver’s auto insurance.</p>\n<p>Making the claim on the driver’s insurance is often the better option because having fewer claims on your policy helps you lower your home insurance costs. It can even make you eligible for <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>. However, if you can’t collect from the driver, your insurance policy will likely cover your claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourfenceisvandalized\">Your fence is vandalized</h2>\n<p>Vandalism is another distressing situation for homeowners. But whether a vandal spray paints your fence, takes a bat to it, or otherwise wreaks havoc on it, you can usually rest assured that your home insurance policy covers the damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"woodrotcausesafallenfence\">Wood rot causes a fallen fence</h2>\n<p>Wood rot in a fence is typically only covered when it’s caused by a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>.</p>\n<p>Clear as mud, right?</p>\n<p>Basically, this means that wood rot caused by an event already covered by your home insurance, like a pipe burst, is usually covered. But rot caused by something else, say neglect, usually isn’t. Homeowners have the responsibility to maintain their homes, and that includes fences, so you want to properly treat any outside wood to repel water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"termitesdamageyourfence\">Termites damage your fence</h2>\n<p>Much like with wood rot, <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">home insurance covers termites</a> in just a couple of unique situations. These are when:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A covered peril causes an infestation.</li>\n<li>An unknown termite infestation causes a sudden collapse.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, termite infestations are more likely to appear when a homeowners doesn’t maintain their property or ignores signs of a growing problem. The result? Termite damage to your fence is seldom covered by your home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofileaclaimforfencedamages\">How to file a claim for fence damages</h2>\n<p>If you have fence damage resulting from a covered peril, you can (and should!) <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a>. The sooner you get your claim in motion, the faster your damage can be assessed and fixed. Contact your insurer's <a href=\"/claims/\">claims center</a> to explain what happened, and make sure to take pictures of the damage to support your claim.</p>"

    body: "<p>Because your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is so central to your daily living, it’s natural to wonder about how it’s covered by your home insurance. No one wants to suffer through a hot Florida summer or cold New England winter with their HVAC on the fritz!</p>\n<p>Like most things in insurance, whether or not your homeowners policy covers your HVAC depends largely on the type of loss you have. But before we dive into loss scenarios, let’s make sure everyone understands the different ways home insurance might cover HVAC units.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeshomeinsurancecoverhvac\">How does home insurance cover HVAC?</h2>\n<p>Damage to HVAC units is typically covered in one of two coverage parts in <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage A, or your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>Coverage C, or your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your HVAC system is considered part of the home, then it’s likely covered by dwelling coverage. If you have a portable unit, then it probably falls under your personal property coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoeshomeinsurancecoverhvac\">When does home insurance cover HVAC?</h2>\n<p>For your home insurance policy to cover your HVAC unit, a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a> has to have caused the loss. Covered perils typically include things like fire or lightning strikes. If the damage is caused by a covered peril – that is, by an incident your homeowners insurance can pay for – then the damage to your AC or heater is probably covered.</p>\n<p>Let’s say a direct lightning strike fries your central AC unit. In that case, there’s a good chance your insurance will pay to repair or replace it. That’s because lightning damage is covered by most standard home insurance policies.</p>\n<p>The same is true for fire damage. If the unit is damaged as a result of a home fire, then the unit can probably be replaced. Again, this may come out of dwelling coverage or personal property coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverdamagetowindowacunits\">Does home insurance cover damage to window AC units?</h3>\n<p>While central air conditioning units are typically categorized as part of the structure of your house, window units are usually considered personal property. In practice, that means that your window unit is less likely to be covered.</p>\n<p>In many policies, like <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a>, central AC units have coverage for “open perils,” meaning they’re covered for anything <em>not</em> explicitly excluded. A window unit, on the other hand, is likely only covered for “named perils,” meaning it’s covered for only events that are specifically listed.</p>\n<p>Every policy is different, though, so check with your agent to find out what kind of coverage you have. In some cases, you may be able to secure coverage by scheduling your window unit specifically in your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoesnthomeinsurancecoverhvac\">When doesn’t home insurance cover HVAC?</h2>\n<p>You will likely have to pay for damage to your HVAC caused by events and perils not covered by your homeowners policy. For example, if your AC unit is ruined in a flood, your homeowners policy likely won’t offer coverage because flooding is excluded on most policies.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration: normal <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">wear and tear isn’t covered</a>. In fact, neglecting the system and having it break is not covered either. If your AC goes kaput after living a good life, it’s up to you to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverdamagecausedbyyourhvac\">Does home insurance cover damage caused by your HVAC?</h2>\n<p>Up until now, we’ve looked at situations where an event damages your HVAC system. But what happens if your HVAC actually causes the damage? Let’s take a look at a couple of examples to sort things out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"damagecausedbyacunits\">Damage caused by AC units</h3>\n<p>Air conditioners create water as they operate (as anyone who’s walked under a dripping window unit knows all too well). If your AC unit isn’t properly maintained, that water can <a href=\"https://www.cooltoday.com/blog/why-is-my-home-air-conditioner-leaking-water-inside-faq\">get into your home and cause damage</a>. And here’s the thing: if the leaking happens because you didn’t properly maintain the unit, your homeowners insurance <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered/\">may not cover the damage</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s because part of the contract with the insurance provider is that you must take steps to keep your home in good repair. Fail to do that, and you’ve essentially broken the contract, meaning the insurance company doesn’t have to provide coverage.</p>\n<p>Your best bet here is to keep your air conditioner in good working order, even if that means calling in an inspector every season. The cost of an inspection will almost certainly be less than the cost of repairing water damage your unit might otherwise cause.</p>\n<h3 id=\"damagecausedbyfurnaces\">Damage caused by furnaces</h3>\n<p>If your furnace causes a fire in your home, your insurance policy likely covers the damage. That’s because fire is a covered peril on most standard homeowners insurance policies. The cost of replacing your furnace? That’s probably not covered.</p>\n<p>As with AC units, it’s your job as a homeowner to keep your furnace in good working order. Part of that means making sure there are functioning carbon monoxide and smoke detectors to alert you of any problems before they cause serious damage or put you in danger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maintainingyourhvacdystem\">Maintaining your HVAC dystem</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to forget about HVAC appliances – which operate very much in the background – until they stop working. But scheduling regular maintenance can save you money on heating and cooling bills and help prevent damage caused by worn-out systems.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in September 2018.

    body: "<p>The idea of having termites in your house is enough to rattle any homeowner. But what’s even more upsetting it the damage they can cause and the cost of repairing it ﹘ as much as $3,000 according to some sources. That high price tag leaves many homeowners wandering if homeowners insurance covers termite damage.</p>\n<p>The shortest and most common answer here is no, home insurance usually doesn’t cover termite damage. The good news? The answer, as with most insurance-related questions, depends on the specifics of any particular.</p>\n<h2 id=\"istermitedamageevercoveredbyhomeinsurance\">Is Termite Damage Ever Covered by Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Termites can do a lot of damage, but most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policies</a> don’t cover these losses – in other words, your home insurance provider is unlikely going to send an exterminator to your house to eradicate the bugs or to repair structures damaged by termite activity.</p>\n<p>Why? Because termite damage is usually seen as a maintenance issue. As we’ve mentioned before, <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">wear and tear isn’t covered by home insurance</a>. Your <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">insurance policy</a> is a contract, and part of the deal you make with your insurance company is that you will maintain the quality of your house. So while you might want to make a claim for termite damage, your insurance provider will likely point out that the damage wouldn’t have happened if you had properly maintained your property</p>\n<p>That said, there are two scenarios where your insurance company may pay for termite-related damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario1termitescauseyourhousetosuddenlycollapse\">Scenario 1: Termites Cause Your House to Suddenly Collapse</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> may cover your damages if termites or other pests cause your home to suddenly collapse. Usually, this is only true if you couldn’t reasonably have known about the termites and the damage they were causing (i.e., the termites and their damage was hidden). But if you ignore signs that you have termites or choose to do nothing about them, then your insurance company will most likely deny your claim.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that your house has to literally collapse from termite damage for you to have a compensable claim. Cracked, bulging, or sagging wood typically won’t be covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario2acoveredperilcausesatermiteinfestation\">Scenario 2: A Covered Peril Causes a Termite Infestation</h3>\n<p>You might also be covered for hidden termite damage when a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> causes an infestation that leads to a loss. For example, let’s say a pipe bursts in your house. The water damage creates an environment that attracts termites and leads to an infestation that ultimately causes damage to your home. Because a burst pipe is a type of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage typically covered by home insurance</a>, then your insurer may also cover your hidden termite-related damage.</p>\n<p>However, your insurance company may deny your claim if you did not report the original cause of the loss, in this case, the burst pipe. It may also deny your claim if the termites or their damage is not hidden.</p>\n<p>Neither scenario is automatically covered by your home insurance. Whether or not your insurer covers a loss usually comes down to the circumstances surrounding the loss and the language in your insurance policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtospottermitedamageinyourhome\">How to Spot Termite Damage In Your Home</h2>\n<p>Termites aren’t always easy to see, but the following are signs that you may have a problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blistering or darkening wood.</li>\n<li>Swollen or buckling wood.</li>\n<li>Discarded termite wings.</li>\n<li>Stuck windows and doors.</li>\n<li>Peeling or discolored wallpaper or bubbling paint.</li>\n<li>Termite droppings, or frass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mud tubes are also a good indicator of termites. These long, narrow veins that run from the ground and up the side of your house protect termites from dry air.</p>\n<p>If you suspect a termite problem, call a professional exterminator to address it. They may have to tent your house or treat the ground depending on the type of termites you have and the extent of the infestation. You may even need to replace damaged wood to maintain the structural integrity of your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stoptermitedamagebeforeitstarts\">Stop Termite Damage Before It Starts</h2>\n<p>Damage from termites and other pests is seldom covered by homeowners insurance, so your best bet is to prevent problems in the first place. The good news is that general home maintenance activities can go a long way toward keeping an infestation at bay. Specifically, be sure to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a professional apply treatment regularly.</strong> Experts recommend treating every five to 13 years, depending on the type of treatment.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimize the soil-to-wood contact around your house.</strong> Keep mulch away from your foundation and make sure wood siding is at least six inches above the soil.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep water away from your foundation.</strong> Check your roof for leaks and that your downspouts direct water away from your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean up your yard.</strong> Termites feed on wood and paper, so remove dead trees and stumps quickly and don’t leave cardboard or newspaper in your yard.</li>\n<li><strong>Use borate.</strong> Before you prime or paint the wood portions of your home, spray borate on it to repel termites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A little extra investment upfront may reduce your chances for a termite infestation as well as other household hazards like mold.

    body: "<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 29 percent of the labor force was capable of working from home in 2018. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, we’re putting that estimate to the test.</p>\n<p>Companies across the country have moved to remote operations to keep their staff and consumers safe and to comply with <a href=\"/blog/work-from-home-tips/\">social distancing</a> orders.</p>\n<p>If you are one of the millions of employees suddenly calling your kitchen table your workspace, you may have some questions that go well beyond your ability to balance your newfound home-work life.</p>\n<p>Let’s answer one in particular. We’ve been getting a lot of questions about whether working from home affects homeowners insurance. The simple answer is that it can – it really depends on the kind of employee you are.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you should know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workingfromhomeandinsurance\">Working from Home and Insurance</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance isn’t business insurance. It protects your <a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">personal property</a> and personal activities. If something is deemed “for business use,” there are strict limits to how homeowners insurance handles that loss.</p>\n<p>For example, our policies offer some protection for business property (like a laptop) but there are limits. You’re covered for up to $2,500 for damaged or lost business property that happens in your home. If damage or loss happens away from home, though? Our policies cap that payout at $250.</p>\n<p>This limited home insurance coverage may apply to both the personal laptop you use for work or the laptop you use to run your home-based business.</p>\n<p>That’s not unusual for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policies</a>. Your risks as a homeowner are very different from your risks as a business owner or employee, as many home-based independent contractors or gig workers will tell you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insuranceneedsforindependentcontractorsvsfulltimeemployees\">Insurance Needs for Independent Contractors vs. Full-Time Employees</h2>\n<p>Independent contractors are business owners in the eyes of the law. That means they are responsible for paying their own taxes, covering their own liabilities, and buying their own insurance to protect their at-home office, equipment, and inventory. As we mentioned above, a home insurance policy alone is not enough to cover these obligations. You’ll need business insurance to address your work liabilities (e.g., if a client visits your home and has an injury) and cover business property (if it exceeds $2,500 in value or ever leaves your home).</p>\n<p>By contrast, full-time remote employees are entitled to have their employer provide the right tools and equipment to get the job done. (Even under normal circumstances, nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/70-percent-of-people-globally-work-remotely-at-least-once-a-week-iwg-study.html\">70 percent of professionals work remotely</a> at least once a week and 53 percent telecommute for at least half the week.) Some working from home employer obligations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying half their remote employee’s employment taxes.</li>\n<li>Providing liability coverage for the employee’s work.</li>\n<li>Covering business-owned equipment with commercial property insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The question is: who covers the stolen personal laptop the employee uses for work purposes while at home? If it’s a company-bought laptop, your employer will typically cover its replacement.</p>\n<p>But a personal laptop stolen from your home that you use for work could be covered by your homeowners policy. If possible, it’s worth asking your employer to cover its replacement anyway to spare you from filing a claim and risking a rate increase.</p>\n<p>If your full-time remote employment requires you to occasionally meet with clients in your home, be aware that homeowners insurance will not cover business-related visitor injuries. Your company’s general liability insurance should cover that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofillworkfromhomeinsurancegaps\">How to Fill Work from Home Insurance Gaps</h2>\n<p>If you’re a full-time employee concerned about liability and personal property while working from home, talk to your supervisor. Find out what coverage extends to you while you are performing company tasks from your home.</p>\n<p>Full-time work from home employees will usually have coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any business property provided to you while working at home.</li>\n<li>Limited coverage for personal property while performing work-related tasks.</li>\n<li>Workers’ compensation for injuries that happen to you while working (not during non-work hours or non-work tasks).</li>\n<li>Liability coverage for business-guest injuries on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a remote full-time employee, your benefits (including insurance) are extended to you while working from home just as they would be if a company sends someone to a conference and there is an issue with theft or injury while traveling.</p>\n<p>Independent contractors, on the other hand, generally <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-ideaexchange/2018/10/15/504001.htm\">get paid 10 percent to 20 percent more</a> because they cover all of their own business costs (insurance, taxes, etc.). A proper business insurance policy will typically cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your business property on and off your home premises.</li>\n<li>Business liability for injuries on or off your property or issues with your work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/do-i-need-business-interruption-insurance\">Business interruption insurance</a> to cover lost revenue when a covered loss forces you to temporarily half business operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we don’t offer business insurance, it is important to us to help clarify what is and isn’t covered during these unusual times. We’re here to help if you have other questions!</p>"

    body: "<p>As protests seeking justice for George Floyd took place across the country last week and continue, many homeowners are wondering if they’re covered for property damage that may accompany civil unrest.</p>\n<p>The short answer: yes.</p>\n<p>Your home and property are covered if they're damaged by fire, vandalism, or civil commotion. Let’s learn more about what “civil commotion” means in the insurance world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscivilcommotion\">What Is Civil Commotion?</h2>\n<p>Civil commotion is one of the covered perils in homeowners insurance policies. That’s true whether you have an <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho5-policy/\">HO5</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6</a>, HO7, or <a href=\"/glossary/ho8-policy/\">HO8</a> policy. Civil commotion is included in both <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named and open perils policies</a>, which at minimum cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li><strong>Riots or civil commotion</strong></li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Civil commotion usually refers to a public revolt that causes harm or property damage. It’s similar to a riot, a public disturbance by at least three people who leverage disorder to further a common purpose. The difference is a riot may or may not include property damage and is typically smaller in scale.</p>\n<p>Vandalism has a more straightforward definition: it’s intentional destruction of someone’s property. Vandalism may accompany civil commotion and riots.</p>\n<p>Your policy will usually not define civil commotion, riots, or vandalism outright, and legal definitions may vary depending on where you live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeshomeownersinsurancecovercivilcommotion\">How Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Civil Commotion?</h2>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/02/george-floyd-protests-live-updates/\">protests happening around the country right now</a> may, at one point or another, fit the category of “civil commotion.” As we saw in Minneapolis, Louisville, New York, Chicago, Columbus, Atlanta, and beyond, protestors have been met with heavy police intervention, with many states calling in the National Guard. In some cities, the chaos led to property damage and theft.</p>\n<p>While property damage has so far been limited to mostly commercial buildings, such as the Target in Minneapolis, it’s worth considering how residential property might be impacted if unrest continues.</p>\n<p>Say, for example, your community organizes a protest in support of police reform and ending extrajudicial violence. During the gathering, some outliers set fire to a trash can. The fire gets out of hand and spreads to a nearby home.</p>\n<p>The loss would be covered by homeowners insurance. In this case, it can pay for fire damage to the structure of the home and pay to replace damaged personal belongings.</p>\n<p>It may also trigger other coverages included in the policy, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>So if that fire made your home uninhabitable while it’s being repaired for fire and smoke damage, your loss of use insurance could help cover the extra costs you take on when damage displaces you. This coverage can pay for expenses beyond your “normal” obligations (like your mortgage and utilities).</p>\n<p>For example, loss of use insurance can pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Renting a new place temporarily</li>\n<li>A hotel stay</li>\n<li>Restaurant meals or takeout</li>\n<li>Laundromat visits</li>\n<li>Storage costs</li>\n<li>Transportation fees</li>\n<li>Pet boarding fees</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is vandalized, that’s also covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy. For example, if someone throws a rock through a window or tags your garage door, your policy can help pay to replace the windows and to clean up the graffiti and repaint.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, property can be repaired and replaced.</p>\n<p>To learn more about what homeowners insurance covers, <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">check out this guide</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Moving can be a headache, but one thing that makes a move easier? Knowing how your homeowners insurance can protect you along the way.</p>\n<p>So does <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> cover moving? The simple answer is that it does cover your belongings for some losses, but the moving company should have insurance that covers other circumstances. Understanding what is covered and what isn’t helps you better prepare for those potential accidents when getting your stuff from one home to the next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canhomeownersinsurancecovermybelongingsduringamove\">Can Homeowners Insurance Cover My Belongings During a Move?</h2>\n<p>Yes, for certain losses. Your homeowners insurance policy can cover your belongings in your home and outside the home. In fact, our policies can cover your belongings anywhere in the world. That includes in a storage facility.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance may also cover some sources of loss to your belongings while in transit if you hire professional movers. It really depends on your policy.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that damage from incidents like car accidents or dropping belongings usually isn’t a covered event, though. Standard <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> cover personal property on a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils</a> basis. That means it can cover damage from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge of water or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing of household systems</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these events probably won’t occur during a move and impact your personal belongings. But theft or fire could be a real risk, and in that case, your home insurance would likely cover the event.</p>\n<p>If you have <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property</a>, like jewelry and collectibles, they’re covered for all sources of damage except those listed as exclusions, like wear and tear, insects or vermin, war, and nuclear hazard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesmoversbusinessinsurancecover\">What Does Movers’ Business Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Under federal law, interstate movers are required to offer one of three different liability coverages to customers. It’s not traditional insurance – it covers consumers for damage or breakage of personal items while in the care of the movers.</p>\n<p>Those three liability options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Released value protection:</strong> Gives minimal protection against loss or damage based on the weight of the item. This coverage doesn’t exceed 60 cents per pound per article. It’s usually offered at no additional charge to customers but doesn’t account for the real value of your items.</li>\n<li><strong>Full value protection:</strong> Pays for the <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> (or the current market value) of your belongings if they are lost, destroyed, or otherwise damaged while in the mover’s care. This coverage is more expensive than released value protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Separate liability coverage:</strong> Compliments released value protection by providing coverage for the loss above the released value. This means that the mover is still responsible for the 60 cents per pound, but homeowners are adding policy coverage for the remaining difference in value. Movers will provide homeowners with a written record of the policy at the time it’s purchased.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"readthemoversagreement\">Read the Mover’s Agreement</h2>\n<p>Because movers offer different levels of coverage, it’s essential to talk to the moving company about how your property is covered while in their care.</p>\n<p>Confirm what coverage is available and read the contract to make sure you get what you ask for. Check the contract for any limitations or caps that might be applicable to certain types of items and the timelines for making a claim. You don’t want to miss out on your coverage simply because you missed a filing deadline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectingpropertywhenmovingyourself\">Protecting Property When Moving Yourself</h2>\n<p>When you box up and move yourself, you won’t have the mover’s protection to pay for any losses or damage. You only have your own coverage to count on.</p>\n<p>Call your insurance representative to review your coverage options. Find out what is automatically included in your existing homeowners policy and determine whether you can add more coverage to address your move.</p>\n<p>On top of checking your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a>, make sure that the rental truck is insured. You can call your auto insurance company to see if your coverage extends to a truck you rent for moving. If it doesn’t, you may want to take out the optional coverage offered by the rental company to protect you from accidents that may happen while driving the truck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"afterthemove\">After the Move</h2>\n<p>Remember that there might be a time limit to filing a claim after you move, so unpack as soon as possible to check items for damage. Take notes of the damage and pictures of what you can. This will help with the claim.</p>\n<p>Call the moving company and ask to file a claim for damages. Don’t throw the damaged items out – set them aside in case the moving company needs more proof. If the moving company doesn’t cover the loss, call your insurance company to see if the coverage you have in place will cover the items. Provide as many details as you can to help expedite the claim.</p>\n<p>While you have your insurance carrier on the phone, double-check for any <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> you may be eligible for in the new house.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning a move to a new house, give us a call. We’ll happily go over coverage that protects you during the move and help you find a new policy for your new home.</p>"

    body: "<p>Dog doors are a great way to give your canine companion some independence – and you a break from having to constantly let them out – by offering Fido the chance to come and go at will. Finding the right doggy door for your home may take a little bit of research, but the effort is worth it once you find one that saves you on energy bills and keeps you and your pets safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readthisbeforeyourbuyadogdoor\">Read This Before Your Buy a Dog Door</h2>\n<p>Choosing a dog door isn’t as simple as picking one out and having it installed. There are a few factors you want to consider first, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost.</strong> We found dog doors for as little as $65, as well as some that cost nearly $2,000. Oddly enough, the high-tech kinds that include a sensor for your dog’s collar weren’t the most expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Size.</strong> Pet doors usually come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. Pick one that allows your dog to move through it comfortably.</li>\n<li><strong>Security.</strong> If you have a large dog, like an Irish wolfhound or a Great Dane, you may end up with a pet door that a person can fit through. Plus, it’s not just potential criminals you need to consider. Small children getting out are also a concern.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy efficiency.</strong> A poorly designed or installed doggy door can cause your energy bills to go up.</li>\n<li><strong>Installation.</strong> While there are many pet doors you can install on your own, others require the help of a professional.</li>\n<li><strong>Location.</strong> You want to make sure your dog or cat can exit your home and enter a safe location, like an enclosed patio or your backyard. This may mean you want to evaluate your fence. Not only do <a href=\"/blog/good-fences-make-good-neighbors/\">good fences make good neighbors</a>, but they keep your pets safe, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing you probably won’t have to worry about is your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. As long as your pet door is properly installed and well maintained, then it shouldn’t cause you any headaches when looking for coverage – at least, not with us!</p>\n<h2 id=\"5typesofdogdoors\">5 Types of Dog Doors</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, a dog door was simply a space covered by a flap that let your dog nose its way out of your home. Now you have lots of different options to choose from that we’ve grouped into five categories. Keep in mind that within these groupings, you’ll likely find any number of materials and styles to fit your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"energyefficientpetdoors\">Energy-Efficient Pet Doors</h3>\n<p>Some dog doors have lightweight vinyl flaps that can become warped or bent, which may mean they’ll do a lousy job of keeping out the cold and wet. The better idea is to find an energy-efficient option to minimize energy loss. For example, a two-flap system is usually more energy efficient than the traditional single-flap entry.</p>\n<p>Most energy-efficient systems also have weatherstripping or an air-tight seal, and many use magnets to help keep the door closed when it isn’t in use. Not only does this help with your energy consumption in the home, but it can also reduce the number of unwanted insects coming in because there aren’t any gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doormounteddoggydoors\">Door-Mounted Doggy Doors</h3>\n<p>Door-mounted pet doors are what probably first comes to mind when people think about doggy doors. They commonly have a plastic or aluminum frame and a flap for your pet to push when it wants to be outside. Some have two or three flaps to improve energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>Door-mounted doggy doors are usually fairly easy to install and for your dog to use. Unfortunately, that means other animals (or worse) may also be able to use it, so you want to look for door-mounted dog doors that have some way of securing the flap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallmounteddogdoors\">Wall-Mounted Dog Doors</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a wall-mounted pet door is situated on the wall of your house rather than in a door. This may mean you install it in a hole drilled into the wall or you may end up with a tunnel running from the inside to the outside. Both can be tricky to install yourself, and you may have to patch the wall if you ever decide to move.</p>\n<p>Most wall-mounted dog doors come with sealed seams and are weatherproof, features that definitely fall in the plus column. The other big draw for wall-mounted pet doors is that they can be placed in less noticeable locations. That’s good for both curb appeal and security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slidingglassdoorinserts\">Sliding Glass Door Inserts</h3>\n<p>A sliding glass door insert is a panel that sits on your existing door track and has a dog door pre-installed at the bottom. You place the insert on the tracks, keeping your sliding glass door partially open, and lock it into place. This allows you to use your door as you normally would.</p>\n<p>This may be the easiest type of pet door to install, so it’s often less expensive than some of the other options on our list. It’s also a great idea for renters because installation doesn’t require you to cut or drill holes in your unit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hightechandelectronicpetdoors\">High-Tech and Electronic Pet Doors</h3>\n<p>All of the doggy doors on our list are manually operated by your pet – usually, with just a push of its snout. However, there are also high-tech and electronic pet doors that are ideal for people concerned about security.</p>\n<p>For example, some electronic dog doors only open when your dog is near by reacting to a chip on your dog’s collar. Others have timers that automatically open and close the door. This helps keep out unwanted intruders of both the animal and human varieties.</p>\n<p>We know you want to keep your animal companions as secure as possible.

    body: "<p>You know that point each winter when it seems like the cold and snow might never go away? Everyone’s a little on edge because they’re tired of looking at the same four walls? These 20 easy home projects may be just the thing you need to reinvigorate your head and your space!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1freshenaroomwithpaint\">1. Freshen a Room with Paint</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">Painting a room</a> is a low-cost way to give it a completely new look and feel. Maybe you want to go basic white or to add a splash of color on an accent wall. However the spirit moves you, take your time with cleaning the wall first and taping the trim so you don’t have to fix too many mistakes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2installsafetysystems\">2. Install Safety Systems</h2>\n<p>If you have a smart home security system you’ve been meaning to set up, now’s the time! Most take minutes to install. Consider adding some additional safety systems, too.</p>\n<p>For example, homes are twice as likely to experience water damage than fire and theft combined. <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">Water sensors</a> are easy to install and connect with your smartphone to monitor leaks. Just place them in areas that might be prone to water damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3updatecabinethardware\">3. Update Cabinet Hardware</h2>\n<p>If you want to give your kitchen a new look without spending on a full remodel, change out the hardware on your cabinets. You only need new hardware and a screwdriver. If you’re mounting new hardware on cabinet doors that had none before, create a template so you mount them uniformly across all cabinets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4hideyourcords\">4. Hide Your Cords</h2>\n<p>Technology makes life easier, but the jumble of cords that come with it can be messy. Luckily, there are plenty of creative ways to organize and hide all the wires and cables required to run our homes these days. For example, you could use zip ties and a wall-mount surge protector to hide your cords behind a bookshelf or entertainment center.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5addcrownmolding\">5. Add Crown Molding</h2>\n<p>Don’t be intimidated by a <a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/how-to-install-crown-molding\">crown molding project</a>. It’s an easy way to spruce up your space. Use a coated polystyrene, which is lightweight, easy to cut with a handsaw, and simple to apply with a joint compound. Just remember to measure twice and cut once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6degrimethehouse\">6. De-Grime the House</h2>\n<p>Homes accumulate dirt and grime on the exterior walls and eaves. If temperatures haven’t dropped too much, you can tidy up the exterior with a power washer. Spray your home’s walls starting at the top and work your way down. It’s cheaper than repainting, and it really brightens up your home’s facade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7installastairrunner\">7. Install a Stair Runner</h2>\n<p>Have some bare stairs in your home? Install a runner – it creates traction that makes your stairs safer. You’ll need a non-slip runner and tacking to set the runner in place. Be sure to measure the space and outline the runner so the tacks are uniformly lined up on the stairs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8installweatherstripping\">8. Install Weatherstripping</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">Lower your energy costs</a> this winter by <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/n/how-to/weather-strip-your-doors\">installing weatherstripping</a> around windows and doors. You can use peel-and-stick strips and place them around doors and windows to keep cold air from entering your home through gaps. That keeps the furnace from kicking on more frequently and reduces overall energy consumption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9replaceyourfurnacefilter\">9. Replace Your Furnace Filter</h2>\n<p>While you’re thinking about energy consumption, take a few minutes to <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">change the furnace filter</a>. This reduces the work the furnace needs to do – it’s harder to produce heat through a clogged filter – and that keeps your heating costs lower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10installnewwindowtreatments\">10. Install New Window Treatments</h2>\n<p>New window treatments can refresh the look of a room, keep heat out, and help improve energy efficiency in your house. Best of all, they are easy to switch out if you already have curtain rods installed. Just measure the length of your windows, find new curtains that are the right length, and replace your old ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11shampoocarpets\">11. Shampoo Carpets</h2>\n<p>Carpets endure a lot, from grass-stained shoes to muddy paws to accidental spills, so now’s the time to give them some love. Deep clean your rugs by renting a steam cleaner. Vacuum your carpets really well before you steam clean them to make sure you have as much of the dirt, hair, and dust out of the carpets for a more effective clean.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12paintkitchencabinets\">12. Paint Kitchen Cabinets</h2>\n<p>Just as painting a room can dramatically change its look, painting your kitchen cabinets can give your kitchen a whole new feel. Remove the doors of all cabinets. Sand the doors and cabinet frames and clean any dust and grime. Put on a fresh coat of paint. Let the cabinets completely dry before you reinstall them. For extra credit, combine your freshly painted cabinets with new hardware for an updated look.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13cleandryerducts\">13. Clean Dryer Ducts</h2>\n<p>Lint in your dryer duct doesn’t just make your dyer less efficient – it’s also a fire hazard. This home improvement task is more about muscle than cost. Unplug and move the dryer out of the way and vacuum the duct with a shop vac to clear the space. Clean the area behind the dryer while you have it pulled out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14organizeyourclosets\">14. Organize Your Closets</h2>\n<p>The first step to organizing your closets is to gather the items you no longer need and either toss them out or donate them. Next, take a moment to think about what sort of storage makes the most sense for you. Do you need more hooks and rods? Additional shelves? Baskets or boxes to keep your items neatly corralled? Any of these options may work, but if you’re not sure, there are tons of online resources to help you figure it out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15createachalkboardwall\">15. Create a Chalkboard Wall</h2>\n<p>Give your little ones a place where they’re allowed to write on the walls by creating a chalkboard wall. Chalkboard paint is inexpensive and an easy way to transform a room that you may need as a home learning environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"16installaprogrammablethermostat\">16. Install a Programmable Thermostat</h2>\n<p>Replace an old dial thermostat with a programmable one – it’s easier than it seems! You can program your thermostat to run lower during the day and increase it at night, depending on your preferences. Customizing its output can reduce your energy bills. Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-install-a-thermostat/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90ebfe13c6\">how-to video to help you get started</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"17installlampdimmers\">17. Install Lamp Dimmers</h2>\n<p>This is a super easy home improvement project and it can transform your home’s lighting. Simply find a plug-in lamp dimmer (about $20 at most home improvement stores), and plug the lamp into the dimmer and the dimmer into the wall. Voila! You now have ambient lighting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"18updateplumbingfixtures\">18. Update Plumbing Fixtures</h2>\n<p>Changing out your old plumbing fixtures is a simple way to change the look of your kitchen or bathroom, but it may also help with your water bills. Look for products with a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/watersense/watersense-label\">WaterSense</a> label from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>\n<p>One caveat: check the weather before you take on this project. You may have to postpone if the temperature is below freezing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"19testyourtoiletflapper\">19. Test Your Toilet Flapper</h2>\n<p>A leaky flapper triggers your fill value to constantly refill your tank, which basically means you’re throwing money down the toilet.You can test your flapper by putting a few drops of food coloring in your tank and waiting 20 - 30 minutes. If the color shows up in your toilet bowl, you have a leak.</p>\n<p>You may be able to stop the leak simply by cleaning your flapper. But if that doesn’t solve the problem, you may need to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"20getsomehouseplants\">20. Get Some Houseplants</h2>\n<p>Nothing livens up a room quite like a new plant friend. They decorate your space and improve the air quality. Plus, if you work from home, plants can also boost your productivity by 15 percent. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140901090735.htm\">Researchers found</a> that plants in your workspace can make you feel more physically, cognitively, and emotionally involved in your work.</p>\n<p>New to greenery? Check out our <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">beginner’s guide to houseplants</a> to find the right plants for you.</p>"

    body: "<p>For many, there’s no sound more soothing than that of a far-off thunderstorm or the pitter-patter of raindrops on a tin roof. But what happens when the thunderstorm isn’t so far off? How do we protect ourselves from the effects of thunderstorms and the damage they can leave in their wake? We’ll review some steps to protect your home from thunderstorm damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimportanceofpreparingforthunderstorms\">The importance of preparing for thunderstorms</h2>\n<p>Storm damage is a fact of homeownership. Research from the National Severe Storms Laboratory shows more than <a href=\"https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/thunderstorms/\">16 million thunderstorms</a> occur each year worldwide. The US sees approximately 100,000 thunderstorms per year, and at least 10 percent of them can be classified as severe.</p>\n<p>That’s over 10,000 severe storms that have the chance to damage homes every year. Whether it’s debris strewn throughout the yard or a <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-fallen-fence/\">fallen fence</a>, the chances are pretty good that you will likely need to clean up after a storm at some point in your homeownership experience.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, cleaning up can be costly, too. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates that severe storms <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/calculating-cost-weather-and-climate-disasters\">average $2.3 billion</a> per catastrophic event.</p>\n<p>While you can’t control Mother Nature, you can take steps to better shield your home from the effects of bad weather. But let’s first get familiar with the kind of thunderstorm damage to watch out for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"effectsofthunderstormsonyourhome\">Effects of thunderstorms on your home</h2>\n<p>So just what kind of damage can a thunderstorm cause? A serious storm can impact your home in several ways, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wind damage.</strong> Wind causes more than half the damage that results from severe storms. Anything in the path of a strong wind gust or a tornado is vulnerable to impact from wind-propelled debris. Even smaller storms that produce derechos – strong straight lines of wind ahead of storms – can cause hurricane-force winds of 75 miles per hour or more in a short timeframe.</li>\n<li><strong>Lighting damage.</strong> Lightning damage is less common than wind damage, but it can be costly to repair. The National Lightning Safety Institute estimates lightning-driven insurance claims average at least $4,234 per claim. Strikes directly to your home can severely damage your electrical systems and ruin unprotected appliances if there’s a <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Hail damage.</strong> Any uncovered structure, object, or person is susceptible to damage or injury during a hail event. Large hail can easily break windows and damage roofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Flood damage.</strong> Heavy downpours can inundate the ground and lead to <a href=\"/blog/what-is-flash-flooding/\">flash flooding</a>. Of the damage a storm can cause, flash flooding is the most costly. An inch of standing water can cost as much as $25,000 for repairs to the home alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhousefromthunderstormdamage\">How to protect your house from thunderstorm damage</h2>\n<p>Sadly, we can’t prevent storms – otherwise there’d be no need for storm shutters, surge protectors, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And that means you can’t prevent storm damage – but you can reduce a storm’s impact on your home. Here’s how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do your research.</strong> Historical weather trends for your region can give you a hint on what kind of damage to expect seasonally. For example, residents in the <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley</a> may be inclined to fortify their roofs to mitigate storm damage. (Of course, the possibility that <a href=\"/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">Tornado Alley is shifting</a> may mean more people will want to do this!)</li>\n<li><strong>Be prepared.</strong> Strong winds can turn any loose object into a projectile, so secure the space around you. Store grills and lawn furniture when not in use. Prune large trees around your home to prevent falling limbs that could roofs and windows. Invest in a lightning rod for your home to lower the likelihood of lightning strikes, and move your vehicles into a garage or covered parking if you can. Lastly, unplug electronics when a storm sets in if you don’t have surge protectors.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay safe.</strong> Make sure your family has a safety and evacuation plan in place to protect yourselves from injury during a storm. Identify a safe room in the house where you can huddle through high winds. Make sure this space is away from windows and located in a structurally sound part of your building, such as a closet or basement bathroom.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisit your policy.</strong> Home insurance plans cover most of the damage we’ve discussed so far, including damage from wind, lightning, hail, and fallen trees. However, home insurance does not cover flood damage. For that protection, you must have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Severe storms can be dangerous and costly, but with planning and preparation, you can weather them. When in doubt about what your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> covers, give your Kin agent a call.</p>"

    body: "<p>Let’s say you’re buying a home when your lender tells you that you need an escrow account. Would you know what that is and why you need it?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry. Escrow accounts are a fairly common practice when making a home purchase. They can even make your life easier when it comes to paying many of the extra expenses that come with buying a home. Let’s take a closer look at how escrow, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, and other costs work together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanescrowaccount\">What is an escrow account?</h2>\n<p>An escrow account is a reserve where money is held during a real estate transaction until certain requirements are met. Typically, a third party, like an escrow company or a mortgage servicer, serves as a go-between and manages the account.</p>\n<p>You may need an escrow account when <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house\">buying a house</a> to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect good faith money, ensuring it’s released to the seller of the home when the contractual terms are met.</li>\n<li>Hold on to funds you can use to pay your home insurance and property tax.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesanescrowaccountwork\">How does an escrow account work?</h2>\n<p>Escrow accounts are really not that complex in nature – they’re essentially holding accounts. Your money sits in escrow until you’ve either met the terms of a contract or your mortgage servicer needs it to pay bills.</p>\n<p>Take the first example. In that scenario, you put your deposit in an escrow account to show that you’re serious about buying the home. The seller gets to keep that money if you back out, but it goes to your down payment if the sale goes through as planned.</p>\n<p>In the second example, your mortgage company has established an escrow account after you purchased a home. It then puts some of your monthly mortgage payment into the account until your property taxes and home insurance premiums are due. When you have this type of escrow account, you make one payment for your mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, and the escrow company pays the appropriate party as required.</p>\n<p>You should note that escrow accounts usually don’t earn interest. As a result, you want to think carefully about whether using escrow to pay home insurance is a good idea for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesescrowpayhomeinsurance\">Does escrow pay home insurance?</h2>\n<p>If you have an escrow account, you likely pay your home insurance bill through it. This usually means you pay a portion of your insurance premium every month with your mortgage payment so that there’s money in the escrow account when the annual premium is due. Basically, you’re prepaying your home insurance bill.</p>\n<p>Lenders like using escrow accounts because they reduce the risk of a homeowner defaulting on a home because they either forgot to pay or didn’t save money for their home insurance or property taxes.</p>\n<p>Lenders contractually require homeowners to keep valid home insurance. This protects the lender’s financial interest in a home because they know it can be rebuilt and retain its <a href=\"/glossary/market-value-of-home/\">market value</a> if there’s a major loss. Lenders have a similar interest in making sure homeowners pay their property taxes. A city may be able to foreclose on properties delinquent in taxes. Requiring property taxes be paid through an escrow account reduces this risk, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doihavetopayhomeownersinsurancethroughescrow\">Do I have to pay homeowners insurance through escrow?</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you use escrow to pay home insurance depends on the contract you signed with your lender. If your lender requires an escrow account, then you most likely have to pay your insurance through it. If your lender does not require an escrow account, then you can choose to pay insurance through an escrow account or directly to your homeowners insurance company.</p>\n<p>Even if your mortgage servicer requires you to set up a home insurance escrow account, you get to decide who you want to insure your home. You still need to pick a company that meets your lender’s requirements, but other than that, the choice is yours.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, you can shop around for a new insurance company even if your escrow account has already been set up. When you do this, you send the new insurance information to the lender, who changes the insurance company. This may require a down payment and some escrow adjustments to ensure you have sufficient funds, but you might also receive a prorated refund from your former insurance company.</p>\n<p>Get more detailed information in our article <a href=\"/blog/change-homeowners-insurance-with-escrow/\"><em>How to change homeowners insurance with an escrow account</em></a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Making sure you can afford your mortgage payments is just as crucial as finding a home you and your family will love – if not more so! The size of your loan is a big part of your total cost of ownership, but so is the mortgage rate you lock in, as well as other house costs like property taxes and insurance. Plus you may have additional homeowners fees and private mortgage insurance premiums to pay.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at several factors that can impact mortgage affordability, starting with the 28/36 rule for how much debt you should have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthe2836rule\">What is the 28/36 rule?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/28-36-rule-mortgages\">28/36 rule</a> is a formula for determining how much debt an individual or household should take on. Basically, it states that a household should spend no more than 28% of its gross monthly income on total housing costs and 36% on debt, like credit card and auto loan payments.</p>\n<p>Lenders frequently use the 28/36 rule to decide whether or not to offer borrowers credit. The idea is that debt loads higher than the 28/36 limits will likely be difficult for a person or household to sustain and may eventually result in default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesthe2836ruleimpactyourhomebuyingbudget\">How does the 28/36 rule impact your home buying budget?</h3>\n<p>Most traditional lenders set a maximum household expense-to-income ratio of 28% and a maximum overall <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\">debt-to-income ratio</a> of 36% when using the 28/36 rule to evaluate your creditworthiness. To do this, they may ask about housing costs and comprehensive debt accounts in the credit application.</p>\n<p>Each lender creates their own standards for housing debt and total debt as part of its underwriting program. But the general idea is that the borrower’s living expenses (e.g., rent, mortgage payments) are at most 28% of their monthly or yearly income. The borrower’s entire debt obligation can’t be higher than 36% of income.</p>\n<p>For example, let's assume that a person earns $5,000 monthly. If that person follows the 28/36 rule, they might set aside $1,000 monthly for their housing costs and mortgage payment. This would leave an additional $800 available for paying back other kinds of loans.</p>\n<p>An easy tip to reduce the debt-to-income ratio is to consolidate multiple debts and clear your financial obligations before applying for a mortgage. When you <a href=\"https://www.ovlg.com/debt-consolidation/\">consolidate multiple debts</a> through a debt consolidation program, your monthly payments get reduced, and it becomes easier for you to get out of debt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisacreditscore\">What is a credit score?</h2>\n<p>Credit scores are three digit numbers that were created to help companies predict the credit behavior of businesses and individuals. The companies that develop credit scores typically look at factors such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-time payment history.</li>\n<li>Amount of unpaid debt.</li>\n<li>Amount of available credit being used.</li>\n<li>Number and type of open loan accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesyourcreditscoreimpactyourhomebuyingbudget\">How does your credit score impact your home buying budget?</h3>\n<p>Mortgage lenders also look at your credit score and credit report when deciding whether you qualify and when calculating your interest rate. They have several different credit scores to choose from, but lenders are more likely to use your FICOⓇ Score.</p>\n<p>The general rule is that a better credit score gets you a lower interest rate. Many mortgage lenders will only pay attention to your application if your score is at least 620. Even when the down payment is just 3% to 5% of the purchase price, a borrower with excellent credit is given the best terms. A borrower with a 3% down payment and a bad credit score (659 or lower), on the other hand, pays more throughout the life of the loan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creditscorerange\">Credit Score range</h3>\n<h3 id=\"creditscorerange-1\">Credit score range</h3>\n<p>| Range | Remarks |\n| --- | --- |\n| 800-850 | Excellent |\n| 740-799 | Very good |\n| 670-739 | Good |\n| 580-669 | Fair |\n| 300-579 | Poor |</p>\n<p>It is legally feasible to get a loan from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with a 500 credit score. However, you’ll probably have to meet other <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/home-loans/i/fha-home-loan-requirements\">requirements</a>, such as having:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Social Security number.</li>\n<li>No bankruptcies for the past two years.</li>\n<li>No short sales, foreclosures, or deeds in lieu of foreclosures for the past three years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional criteria may apply, and you should note that you may end up paying a lot more money then you would with a different type of loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatotherfactorsinfluencehowmuchhouseyoucanafford\">What other factors influence how much house you can afford?</h2>\n<p>How much house you can afford is determined partly by your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly income.</li>\n<li>Cash reserves for a down payment and closing costs.</li>\n<li>Monthly expenses.</li>\n<li>Credit history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These all influence your budget and how much of a down payment you can make. Your down payment varies based on the type of loan you take out, and it plays a significant role in determining your mortgage affordability.</p>\n<p>A larger down payment can result in a lower interest rate and more rapid home equity growth. On the other hand, a lower down payment can mean you end up with higher costs overall.</p>\n<p>For example, you may be required to pay for <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) if your down payment is less than 20 on a traditional loan. That can increase your monthly mortgage payment by the annual cost of PMI – usually around 1% of your outstanding loan balance. Once your remaining balance reaches 80% of the initial loan amount, you can ask to have PMI removed.</p>\n<p>That said, there are ways to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">buy a home for no money down</a>. Both the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Agriculture have loan programs that don’t require a down payment. Plus, there are loans that only ask for 3% to 5%, like an FHA loan that needs just a 3.5%.</p>\n<p>Other factors that influence your house buying budget are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest rates.</strong> The interest rate imposed on your mortgage affects its affordability. More often than not, homebuyers with high credit scores qualify for cheap <a href=\"/blog/how-does-mortgage-interest-work/\">mortgage interest rates</a>, though lenders also consider your income and other loans.</li>\n<li><strong>Property taxes.</strong> Buying a home means taking on the associated tax obligations, so you want to account for property taxes in addition to your mortgage payment. That bill can be very different depending on the value and location of your property.</li>\n<li><strong>Homeowners insurance.</strong> Getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> protects you from financial losses should you experience a catastrophe. <a href=\"/blog/11-factors-impacting-home-insurance-premium/\">Several factors impact premium</a>, but the average is just over $1,200 per year.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing costs.</strong> Closing is the last step in buying a home, and there are usually <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">closing costs</a> that must be paid at that time. These can range from 2% to 5% of the price of the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, you want to think carefully about how much house you can afford. If you base your decision solely on how much you want to spend each month on your mortgage payments, you may end up short.</p>\n<p>Instead, look at your whole financial situation. That starts with whether or not you can afford a mortgage as well as the other costs that come with homeownership. After you've done all of that, it's time to start looking for the perfect home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheauthor\">About the author</h3>\n<p>Lyle Solomon has extensive legal experience, in-depth knowledge, and experience in consumer finance and writing.

    body: "<p>Autumn means it’s time for apple picking, pumpkin patches, cozy evenings…and some fall home maintenance. A well-maintained home keeps the cold air out and the energy bills down, but it can also prevent many common winter home insurance claims.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of what to add to your fall checklist for home maintenance, and reasons why each is important to protect you and your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1checkforgapsinyourwallsandwindows\">1. Check for Gaps in Your Walls and Windows</h2>\n<p>Fall is a good time to take a close look at any caulk, weatherstripping, or sealant to make sure it’s still protecting you from the elements. Pay close attention to your windows, doors, and basement walls. Water damage might not be covered by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowner's insurance</a> if your provider thinks you could have prevented it with regular maintenance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2inspectyourroof\">2. Inspect Your Roof</h2>\n<p>Take a good look at your roof for any signs of wear that could be made worse by winter weather. This might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Curling, buckling, or otherwise damaged shingles.</li>\n<li>Rust, cracked caulk, or open seams on your roof or chimney flashing.</li>\n<li>A missing or damaged chimney cap.</li>\n<li>Patches of moss.</li>\n<li>Cracked or worn rubber around pipes and vents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These incidents can be due to wear and tear, which <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">isn’t usually covered</a> by your homeowners insurance policy. However, keeping your home in good condition means you’ll be less likely to have trouble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3haveyourfurnaceandfireplacecleaned\">3. Have Your Furnace and Fireplace Cleaned</h2>\n<p>By keeping your <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-hvac/\">heating systems clean</a> and in good working order, you can prevent fires or other damage to your home that might lead to a claim. The first step here is to inspect your air filters and either vacuum the dust and debris or replace them if it’s been more than a month since you last changed them. Next, have a professional inspect your HVAC system before the cold weather rolls in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4prepyouroutdoorplumbing\">4. Prep Your Outdoor Plumbing</h2>\n<p>Damage from a burst pipe is often covered by insurance policies, but it’s a headache you can usually avoid with a little extra work. You may need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drain your hoses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/how-to-winterize-a-sprinkler-system/\">Winterize your sprinkler system</a>.</li>\n<li>Shut off outdoor faucets.</li>\n<li>Insulate exterior pipes to prevent freezing and bursting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also want to check interior pipes for insulation, especially any in unheated areas, like garages, basements, and floor cavities above crawl spaces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5stockuponsupplies\">5. Stock Up on Supplies</h2>\n<p>Make sure you have a shovel and salt ready for winter weather and the accidents it can bring. If you use a gas snowblower, don’t forget to purchase extra fuel. By keeping your walkways clear of ice, you can keep your visitors from slipping and getting hurt. While your homeowners insurance typically <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">covers guests’ medical bills</a> from these kinds of injuries, it’s best to avoid any falls to begin with.</p>\n<p>In an area where there’s not a lot of ice and snow? Then you may want to use the end of <a href=\"/blog/atlantic-hurricane-season-2021/\">hurricane season</a> to double check the supplies in your disaster kit. Granted, that’s not really a fall home maintenance tip, but trust us﹘you’d rather stock up on now than be out of supplies during the next hurricane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6takecareoftrippinghazards\">6. Take Care of Tripping Hazards</h2>\n<p>Cracks in your walkways or driveways can become much bigger problems over the winter. When water freezes, it expands﹘leading cracks to become larger holes that guests might trip over. Sealing them now helps prevent injuries and the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability claims</a> that may follow. Be sure to also check any stairs and railings for damage that might also trip up your visitors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7cleanupoutside\">7. Clean Up Outside</h2>\n<p>Moving water away from your home’s foundation is key to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">reducing the risk of water damage</a>, so clear out your gutters and tighten any loose brackets so water can drain properly. You might also want to store outdoor furniture and equipment, like lawn mowers and grills. Your homeowners policy most likely pays to repair these items, but usually only when the damage is caused by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fallhomemaintenancecanprotectyouallwinter\">Fall Home Maintenance Can Protect You All Winter</h2>\n<p>Whether winters tend to be mild or severe where you live, making time for basic maintenance is essential to keeping your house in good working order. And if you’re interested in going beyond maintenance and dabbling in improvements, consider <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">applying for better home insurance</a>.

    body: "<p>One of the biggest barriers to buying a house for most first-time buyers is coming up with the down payment. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was founded in 1934 to help solve that problem.</p>\n<p>The FHA insures mortgages offered by partner banks to make it easier for first-time homebuyers to buy a house. Homebuyers can put down much less for the home than they would with a conventional mortgage, and the FHA mortgage insurance protects lenders if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage. It’s less risk for the lender and less barrier-to-entry for first-time buyers.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, the FHA has <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/fhahistory\">insured more than 46 million mortgages</a>. While the FHA loan makes homeownership easy, it still has some of its own requirements for down payments, credit scores, debt-to-income ratio, private mortgage insurance, and inspections. Let’s dig in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsfordownpaymentcreditscore\">FHA Loan Requirements for Down Payment &amp; Credit Score</h2>\n<p>No matter the <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">type of mortgage</a> you choose, credit scores are a big factor in your eligibility. The same goes for an FHA loan.</p>\n<p>Your credit score often determines the cost of the down payment. With conventional mortgages, the lender usually requires a 620 FICO score with 20 percent down payment – much higher than the FHA loan requires.</p>\n<p>An FHA loan has a minimum credit score of 500. If your credit score is between 500 and 579, the FHA requires a 10 percent down payment. If your credit score is 580 or higher, you only need to come up with 3.5 percent down. Put another way, that’s only $3,500 for every $100,000 borrowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsfordebttoincomeratio\">FHA Loan Requirements for Debt-to-Income Ratio</h2>\n<p>Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is the percentage of your monthly gross income used to pay for monthly expenses. Lenders look at two DTI ratios: total debt and mortgage debt. Lenders use maximum ratios to ensure borrowers have enough monthly income to pay all debts – particularly the home loan.</p>\n<p>An FHA loan is more generous than some other home loans when it comes to the maximum DTI. The FHA sets the limit at 43/31. The first number refers to your total monthly debt. That means that when you add up all your monthly expenses – mortgage, car payment, credit cards, student loans – it can’t exceed 43 percent of your monthly income. The second number is the maximum amount the mortgage can be of your monthly income – not more than 31 percent.</p>\n<p>For example, if you make $5,000 per month, you can’t have more than $2,150 going toward debt each month. The maximum mortgage payment caps at $1,550 per month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsforprivatemortgageinsurance\">FHA Loan Requirements for Private Mortgage Insurance</h2>\n<p>Private <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>, or PMI, is a type of insurance that protects lenders if a homeowners defaults on the loan. It’s required when you put less than 20 percent down on a home. Don’t confuse it with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, which protects the home against physical damage.</p>\n<p>With an FHA loan, homebuyers are required to have mortgage insurance and pay what is called upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP). The upfront amount is 1.75 percent of the loan amount paid at closing. It can also be rolled into the mortgage.</p>\n<p>The monthly mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is between 0.45 and 1.05 percent of the loan amount. The variation depends on the loan down payment and term. You pay the MIP for the life of the FHA loan if you put down less than 10 percent. If you put down 10 percent or more, you pay mortgage insurance premiums for 11 years.</p>\n<p>In either case, you can get PMI removed by refinancing to a non-FHA loan.

That’s why the FHA requires that the home must be the buyer’s primary residence. In other words, you have to live in the home you’re buying with an FHA loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsforinspectionsandappraisals\">FHA Loan Requirements for Inspections and Appraisals</h2>\n<p>All new home purchases with an FHA loan must meet minimum property requirements established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The <a href=\"/blog/when-to-walk-away-after-a-home-inspection/\">inspection report</a> must prove the home is safe, sound, and secure.</p>\n<p>While most homebuyers use the inspection report to negotiate for repairs or credits, the FHA looks at the report to make sure the home meets minimum HUD requirements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/4000.1hsgh.pdf\">HUD’s Single-Family Policy Handbook</a> has a complete list of the requirements, but the property must have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structurally sound foundation.</li>\n<li>Water drainage away from the home.</li>\n<li>Functioning utilities.</li>\n<li>Functioning appliances.</li>\n<li>Hot and cold water with adequate water pressure.</li>\n<li>No chipping or peeling paint.</li>\n<li>Properly functioning electrical outlets and switches.</li>\n<li>Windows that can open, close, and lock.</li>\n<li>No roof leaks and a roof with at least two years life remaining.</li>\n<li>Ventilated and damage-free attics and crawl spaces.</li>\n<li>No active termite infestation.</li>\n<li>No environmental hazards, unreasonable odors, or excessive noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An FHA loan can be denied if the property doesn’t meet these requirements. The inspection and the appraisal may happen at different times. While the inspection looks at the function of things in and around the house, the appraisal considers market value compared with other homes in the area.</p>\n<p>The appraisal must meet or exceed the amount of the loan. If your appraisal comes in under the loan value, the loan will either not be approved or you will have to come up with cash to make up for the difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finalnoteonfhaloanrequirements\">Final Note on FHA Loan Requirements</h2>\n<p>The FHA loan makes it easier for many new homeowners to afford a property, but it’s not without its requirements. Be sure to compare different types of mortgages to make sure you get the loan that’s right for your needs. But don’t be afraid to explore the FHA – it can be a great way to enter the world of homeownership sooner than you may have expected.</p>"

    body: "<p>Getting finances in order – whether that’s saving money or paying down debt – is one of the most common New Year’s resolutions each year.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/resolution-ideas\">one third of resolutions fail</a> before the end of January, homeowners – with mortgages and home repairs to contend with – have a lot of incentive to stick to their financial goals. Even a little wiggle room in a budget can be free up funds for home maintenance, paying extra toward a loan principal, or finally taking that vacation.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like you, you’ve come to the right place. Here are seven financial goals to help homeowners take control of their finances this coming year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1createorrevisityourhouseholdbudget\">1. Create or revisit your household budget</h2>\n<p>Revisiting your budget should be one at the top of your to-do list for the coming year. It’s the perfect opportunity to update your income and expenses and review your spending habits from last year.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t made a budget yet, now’s the time. Making a budget just means subtracting your fixed expenses from your income and then deciding how to allocate the rest of your funds.</p>\n<p>Start by making a list of all your home and living expenses. Some amounts are fixed while others fluctuate over the year, so be thorough and calculate averages when appropriate (like for utilities). Be sure to include expenses like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage payments</li>\n<li>Utility costs for gas, electric, water, garbage, and recycling</li>\n<li>Homeowners association or condo fees</li>\n<li>Internet, cable, and phone bills</li>\n<li>Home repairs</li>\n<li>Home and auto insurance</li>\n<li>Landscaping</li>\n<li>Home security</li>\n<li>Other loan payments, like car loans, student loans, or home equity loans</li>\n<li>Credit card bills</li>\n<li>Other expenses, like housekeeping, piano lessons, or pet care</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep track of your expenses and spending, try documenting them in a simple <a href=\"https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/budgeting-saving/google-sheets-budget-template-review/\">Google Sheet</a>. It’s easy to update from your computer or smartphone.</p>\n<p>You can also check out some apps that beautifully display your budget and track your spending. <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\">Mint</a> categorizes transactions from linked cards and accounts in a budget you can customize, and <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\">You Need a Budget</a> is great for type-A personalities who want to give every dollar a specific job.</p>\n<p>And if analog is your style, a handwritten budget is completely fine! Just keep it in a place you can easily access and consider making a copy.</p>\n<p>Once you have a full account of your home and living expenses, you can see what non-essential spending you can cut and how much money you have left to put toward savings and paying down debt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2setupafundforhomerepairs\">2. Set up a fund for home repairs</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/home-services-survey-0218/\">Bankrate survey</a> found the average homeowner spends $2,000 per year on <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance</a>, like small repairs and lawn care. That doesn’t include large repairs like replacing a roof or hot water heater, which can be several thousand dollars on their own.</p>\n<p>If you’re like <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/home-services-survey-0218/\">60 percent of Americans</a>, you may not be able to cover an unexpected expense like that with your savings.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s wise to create a fund to help pay for big home repairs. Ideally, every homeowner would have an high-yield savings account with three to six months’ worth of expenses stashed away. While that may seem like a lot if you don’t have much in savings right now, consistently contributing even $200 a month to a savings account would bring you to $2,400 by the end of the year plus interest.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The average homeowner spends $2,000 per year on home maintenance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3updateyourhomeinsurance\">3. Update your home insurance</h2>\n<p>We recently <a href=\"/blog/survey-fl-homeowners-insurance-cost/\">surveyed homeowners in Florida</a> and found that 40 percent don’t know how much they spend on their home insurance. The kicker? About 36 percent haven't compared their insurance in more than five years.</p>\n<p>That is a surefire way to leave money on the table, folks.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss opportunities to save on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a>. Take a few minutes each year to compare coverage offerings from multiple insurers before it’s time to renew your policy. Ask providers about their available discounts. You can even consider a higher deductible to reduce your premium.</p>\n<p>That said, price shouldn’t be the only deciding factor when comparing home insurance. You don’t want to pay less for a policy that leaves you underinsured. That will force you to pay more out of pocket when a major disaster strikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4paydownyourloanprincipal\">4. Pay down your loan principal</h2>\n<p>If you’re like many homeowners, your monthly mortgage payment is likely your biggest expense. So this goal is definitely a stretch goal, but if you can financially swing it, extra principal payments can significantly speed up paying off your mortgage.</p>\n<p>In fact, you can trim seven years off a 30-year fixed loan just by making one extra principal payment a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5paydownyourcreditcarddebt\">5. Pay down your credit card debt</h2>\n<p>Got some credit card debt? You’re not alone. The average US household has <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/average-credit-card-debt-household/\">$6,849 in revolving credit card debt</a>, and credit card debt has increased more than 34 percent in the past five years.</p>\n<p>To pay down your debt, make the minimum payments on each account each month. This is essential – you don’t want to miss payments and hurt your credit score.</p>\n<p>When you have extra to put toward paying down your debt, prioritize making payments on cards that have the highest interest rates. If you're struggling to make progress on those cards because of the high balance and interest charges, explore cards that offer a 0% APR on balance transfers. This will usually give you a year without interest charges so you can put more money toward paying off your balance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6takeadvantageofpropertytaxexemptions\">6. Take advantage of property tax exemptions</h2>\n<p>The average US homeowner pays about <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-property-taxes/11585/\">$2,279 in property taxes</a>, though that bill varies drastically depending on where you live. Because property taxes can be considerable, it’s smart to take advantage of tax exemptions when you can.</p>\n<p>Homeowners in many states can claim a homestead exemption, which means a certain amount of their home’s assessed value won’t be taxed.</p>\n<p>For example, homeowners in Alaska who are 65 or older don't pay taxes on the first $150,000 of their primary residence’s assessed value. The <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida homestead exemption</a> reduces a homeowner’s property taxes by $50,000, so a home worth $200,000 is taxed only for $150,000.</p>\n<p>Seniors, folks with disabilities, veterans, and energy efficient homes may also qualify for tax exemptions, depending on your state’s tax laws.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The average US homeowner pays about $2,279 in property taxes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"7consideranincomeproperty\">7. Consider an income property</h2>\n<p>With the rebounding housing market and stable mortgage rates, this might be a good year to invest in an <a href=\"/blog/saving-tips-first-time-homeowners/\">income property</a> if you can swing it. You can tap your home’s equity to buy a second home, so long as cash flow is good and so is your credit. You might even make enough off your investment property to help pay off your primary home’s mortgage faster. Just remember to save 40 percent of your rental revenue to cover repairs, utilities, taxes, and insurance.</p>\n<p>If buying a second home is not in the cards for you right now, you can explore making extra money by renting part of your home on Airbnb. Just <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">make sure your homeowners insurance will cover the extra risk</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>The tricky thing about homeowners insurance is that it’s all about trust. You don’t get a physical product, so you have to believe that your insurance company will be able to meet its obligations to you should you file a claim. This is why financial ratings are so important to insurance providers and policyholders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarefinancialstrengthratings\">What Are Financial Strength Ratings?</h2>\n<p>Financial ratings, sometimes called financial strength ratings or FSRs, are scores that help consumers know if an insurance company is financially healthy. They were created by independent ratings companies to indicate if an insurer can pay claims, especially in a catastrophic scenario.</p>\n<h2 id=\"independentfinancialratingcompaniesforhomeinsurers\">Independent Financial Rating Companies for Home Insurers</h2>\n<p>Six different companies rate home insurance companies, and each one has a unique way of evaluating financial strength::</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AM Best.</li>\n<li>Demotech, Inc.</li>\n<li>Fitch.</li>\n<li>Standard &amp; Poor’s Insurance Rating Services.</li>\n<li>Moody’s.</li>\n<li>Kroll Bond Rating Agency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best known of these rating companies is probably AM Best.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfactorsdofinancialratingcompanieslookat\">What Factors Do Financial Rating Companies Look At?</h2>\n<p>The independent rating agencies look at a company's records and financial statements to determine its FSR. Depending on the rating company, these statements might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balance sheets.</li>\n<li>Reports filed with regulators.</li>\n<li>Economic and industry reports.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">Reinsurance</a> information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demotech, Inc is unique among these financial rating companies in that it can evaluate new insurance companies. Newer insurance companies like Kin don’t have as much historical information, so Demotech, Inc focuses on pro forma financial statements, or statements that forecast future periods, for new insurers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagoodfinancialratingforhomeinsurance\">What Is a Good Financial Rating for Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>When you’re looking for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, you want to look for a company with a high rating. In fact, your insurance company’s <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">financial strength</a> is so important that your mortgage lender most likely requires your insurer to have achieved a certain rating. This generally means sticking to companies with an A grade because that indicates a company is in good financial standing with the capacity to handle catastrophic <a href=\"/claims/\">claims</a> scenarios.</p>\n<p>We’ve gathered the financial rating scales for the six independent ratings agencies and listed them below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambestfinancialratingscale\">AM Best Financial Rating Scale</h3>\n<p>| Rating Symbol | Rating Category |\n| --- | --- |\n| A+ | Superior |\n| A | Excellent |\n| B+ | Good |\n| B | Fair |\n| C+ | Marginal |\n| C | Weak |\n| D | Poor |</p>\n<h3 id=\"demotechincfinancialstabilityratings\">Demotech, Inc.

Many insurance companies like to get rated by AM Best because it’s a large, well-known rating agency that has been around a long time and focuses solely on insurance. But its rating method favors older, more established insurers.</p>\n<p>Other financial rating companies may not have been around as long as AM Best, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t as good. Demotech, for example, had its methodology reviewed and accepted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1990, just five years after it started.</p>\n<p>All in all, the six ratings companies have solid reputations for accurately reflecting an insurance company’s ability to pay claims and handle debts. Just remember that ratings can change, so you want to know what an insurance company’s rating is before you buy or renew a policy.</p>"

    body: "<p>Nobody wants to pay more than they have to for homeowners insurance. But some low-cost insurance options “save” you money by leaving out important protections. In the event of a claim, these policies end up costing you far more time, money, frustration – or all three.</p>\n<p>But don’t worry. There are ways to find lower-cost home insurance that actually offers adequate coverage.</p>\n<p>Don't pay more than you have to for homeowners insurance. Follow these tips to find good coverage at an affordable price.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1shoparoundandgoonline\">1. Shop around – and go online.</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been renewing the same homeowners insurance policy with the same carrier for years, you may be able to save money by switching carriers. Before you call up all the insurance agents in your community, though, try an online search. New technology (including the use of big data) means that some internet-based startups are able to offer better rates than the established players you’ve heard of.</p>\n<p>There are other reasons why local agents may not be able to offer the best rates. For one thing, they’ve got a lot of overhead (like renting an office) to pay for that online companies don’t. (Read more about why local agents might cost you more.)</p>\n<p>Another benefit of shopping online: you may be able to see and compare costs instantly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2readthefineprint\">2. Read the fine print.</h2>\n<p>Before choosing a low-cost home insurance policy, make sure you review the details of your coverage. In some cases, a low cost could equal less coverage, which could mean you’re not protected when you need it.</p>\n<p>One thing to look out for: if your policy is written on form HO-1 (also called a “named perils” policy), your protection will be limited. A named perils policy only covers you for events explicitly named in the policy, which means the carrier has lots of wiggle room to deny claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3checkonlinereviews\">3. Check online reviews.</h2>\n<p>Once you’re satisfied that the policy you’re considering offers adequate coverage, do a quick search for reviews of the company you’re thinking of buying from. Pay attention in particular to what customers say about customer service. The last thing you want is a poorly staffed service department: if it’s not easy to get in touch with the company, it won’t be easy to make a claim. That will be doubly (or triply) true in the event of a major disaster that hits lots of customers at once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4askaboutspecialoffers\">4. Ask about special offers.</h2>\n<p>Home insurance companies are all about pricing risk accurately, so if you can show that your house is less risky than others, you may be able to snag a lower-cost policy. For example, many home insurance companies offer lower prices for homes with <a href=\"/blog/1-tip-to-lower-florida-homeowners-insurance/\">roofs that are likely to withstand high winds</a>. If you’ve been meaning to get a new roof anyway, this could be a great way to kill two birds with one stone: update your roof, then save money on your insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Another common way to save is by installing a home security system.</p>\n<p>But keep in mind that every insurance company is different.

    body: "<p>Air leaks in your home don’t just leave you with an uncomfortable draft. They lead to higher energy consumption and a bigger carbon footprint. Finding air leaks in the house enables you to close them up and make your heating and cooling systems more efficient.</p>\n<p>But these leaks aren’t always obvious. In fact, they can be surprisingly sneaky and nearly invisible to the naked eye. Leaks usually come through cracks and openings in your doors and windows, but even your electrical outlets and floorboards could be sources of excessive air leaking.</p>\n<p>So how can you get rid of them? In this guide, we’ll explore some of the most common sources of air leakage and discuss how to find air leaks in a house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyitsimportanttofixairleaks\">Why it’s important to fix air leaks</h2>\n<p>Did you know that air leaks inside your home could result in you using <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ec479.pdf\">up to 30% more energy</a>? This not only translates to higher utility bills, but air leaking also means your HVAC system is working harder to maintain a comfortable temperature. The harder it works, the more likely your systems will eventually experience maintenance problems and potentially reduce the overall lifespan of the system.</p>\n<p>Knowing how to find where cold air is coming in not only allows you to maintain your HVAC system and a comfortable temperature — it can also improve the air quality in your home, keeping you and your family safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonsourcesofairleakage\">Common sources of air leakage</h2>\n<p>The key to knowing how to detect air leaks in houses is knowing where to look. Here are some of the areas you should check first yo find air leaks in a house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attic hatch</li>\n<li>Piping</li>\n<li>Wires</li>\n<li>Plumbing vents</li>\n<li>The tops of your basement’s walls</li>\n<li>Chimneys</li>\n<li>Recessed lighting</li>\n<li>Windows</li>\n<li>Doors</li>\n<li>Ductwork</li>\n<li>Baseboards</li>\n<li>Garages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hate to break it to you, but this is only a short list of where those leaks might be coming from. You could patch up one air leak and not realize there are five others in the same area! That’s why calling in a professional is best — they’re trained in how to find air leaks in houses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofindairleaksiniourhouse6ways\">How to find air leaks in iour house: 6 Ways</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to check for air leaks in houses might feel overwhelming, but there are a few methods you can try that may help you find leaks so you can air seal your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visualinspection\">Visual inspection</h3>\n<p>Weatherstripping and caulking eventually wears away, and it’s considered good practice to check your existing insulation visually. Take a look at the areas outside and inside your home for any cracks or gaps. You can also place your hand next to any suspected areas to detect a temperature change or air flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Visual inspections may help you find some leaks, but this method isn’t always reliable. You’d be surprised how many leaks aren’t visible to the eye.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingpressurizationtest\">Building pressurization test</h3>\n<p>If a visual inspection doesn’t turn up any leaks, try conducting a building pressurization test. First, you’ll need to wait for a windy day. Once you get one, you can follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off any combustible appliances, heaters, water heaters, and furnaces.</li>\n<li>Close all the doors, windows, and any fireplace flues.</li>\n<li>Turn on the exhaust fans inside your house. (You can also use a large window fan to remove the air from your home.)</li>\n<li>Light an incense stick and move it toward suspected areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the smoke is sucked out or blown into the room, you’ve found your leak.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can do this at home without the help of a professional, but it’s important to proceed carefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airleakdetectors\">Air leak detectors</h3>\n<p>Air leak detectors are used to — you guessed it! — detect air leaks. The most common type of detector is the smoke pencil air leak detector. These detectors will produce smoke so that you can easily see where the air is going. Similar to the pressurization test, you've found a leak if air is blown into the room or sucked out.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the budget, consider investing in an ultrasonic air leak detector. An ultrasonic air leak detector uses ultrasound waves to identify leaks. These are among the most accurate home leak detectors available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theflashlightmethod\">The flashlight method</h3>\n<p>The flashlight method is designed to catch larger leaks in windows and doors. Grab a flashlight (or use your smartphone) and wait until it’s dark outside. Turn out the lights in your home and shine a flashlight anywhere you think there might be a gap or a crack. Ask someone to stand on the other side. If they can see any rays of light coming through, you’ve found your leak.</p>\n<p>Note: The downside to the flashlight method is it’s only effective for larger cracks. However, as rudimentary as this method is, it’s still a highly effective way of finding sources of air leakage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dirtyatticinsulation\">Dirty attic insulation</h3>\n<p>Attics are one of the most common culprits when it comes to air leaks. They can also hurt the air quality of your home because attics are regularly filled with dust. This type of leak is typically a bit easier to diagnose — it’s hard to ignore dusty air flying around the home.</p>\n<p>Performing this test is essentially the same as doing a visual inspection. Check to see if your attic insulation has darkened, caused by dusty air coming in through cracks in your attic. You might even notice frosty areas on your insulation if warm air has come into contact with cold air in your attic. Not only is this one of the best tips for how to find cold air leaks in houses, but it may also help you prevent mold.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the winter, you’ll often find “frosty” areas in your attic because the warm air from downstairs is condensing and freezing when it reaches the cold air in your attic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blowerdoortest\">Blower door test</h3>\n<p>Professionals often use the blower door test. During this process, they seal an entire property and blow a depressurization fan through it. It’s typically installed within the doorway, creating a low-pressure wave indoors. This forces air through any leaks and cracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ordering a professional blower door test is one of the best ways to find those hidden areas that need to be insulated. While there are DIY methods, calling in experts is often your best choice..</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourhomewithkininsurance\">Protect your home with Kin Insurance</h2>\n<p>Air leaks can do real damage to a home’s heating and cooling systems, and HVAC repairs can put a major dent in your bank account.

    body: "<p>Ready to see what else is out there? Learn how to shop for a new home insurance policy like a pro.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thesmartwaytoshopfornewhomeinsurance\">The smart way to shop for new home insurance</h2>\n<p>There's no need to be at the whim of an insurance company. Arm yourself with knowledge so you can make informed decisions throughout the process of comparing and buying homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Before you shop for coverage, understand what your end goal is: a more affordable policy? Better protection? A <a href=\"/claims/\">better claims experience</a>? Knowing what you want will help you better compare offerings.</p>\n<p>Next, follow these steps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandthebasics\">Understand the basics</h2>\n<p>Every insurance company is a little different, but they mostly care about the same factors that influence the “riskiness” of your house (and therefore the cost of your insurance). Those factors include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age of your house.</li>\n<li>Construction materials.</li>\n<li>Proximity to a fire station.</li>\n<li>Geographic region (and likely weather events).</li>\n<li>Additional structures (like a pool).</li>\n<li>Safety and security features (burglar alarm, smoke detector).</li>\n<li>Safety of your neighborhood.</li>\n<li>Whether you own a dog (and if so, what breed).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that, in addition to your risk factors, a few other factors will affect the cost of your homeowners insurance premium, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The deductible you choose.</li>\n<li>Liability coverage limits you choose.</li>\n<li>Whether you cover property at its replacement value or actual cash value (ACV).</li>\n<li>Whether you endorse high-value items you own (like fine furs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But again, every insurance company is a little different. That’s why it’s important to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"shoparound\">Shop around</h2>\n<p>These days, it’s easy to apply for homeowners insurance online and compare rates. It’s always wise to see offers from at least three providers before choosing a new policy. If you’re quoted premium prices that are wildly different from each other, make sure you’re able to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"compareapplestoapples\">Compare apples to apples</h2>\n<p>This is where you’ll have to get into the fine print. No two homeowners insurance policies are exactly the same, so it’s up to you to make sure you understand factors that might affect cost differences. A few to keep your eye out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Property insurance</strong></a>: Policies that offer replacement-value coverage for your personal property tend to be more expensive than those that offer actual-cash-value coverage. In the event of a claim, replacement-value coverage offers enough money to replace your stuff with new equivalents. Actual-cash-value coverage only offers enough to cover buying items in a similar condition.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability limits</strong></a>: A policy that offers $100,000 in personal liability coverage may be less than one that offers $500,000 – but most insurers agree that the former level is inadequate. Saving money in the short term doesn’t always meaning saving down the road.</li>\n<li><strong>Deductible</strong>: The higher your deductible, the lower your premium. But keep in mind that your insurance isn’t that valuable if you can’t afford your deductible, which is the amount you’re required to pay before your benefits kick in.</li>\n<li><strong>Structure of the insurance company</strong>: One reason Kin is able to offer lower prices than other insurers is that we don’t have brokers, so we don’t have to pay broker taxes. We also don’t have brick-and-mortar locations: more savings. If a low price seems too good to be true, do a little digging to find out where the company is making cuts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lookbeyondcost\">Look beyond cost</h2>\n<p>It’s natural to want to save money on your new homeowners insurance. But keep in mind that there’s more to insurance than its cost. As you get close to choosing your new policy, try calling customer service numbers. How easy is it to deal with the reps? How long do you have to wait on hold?</p>\n<p>Other considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you manage your policy online?</li>\n<li>How are their customer reviews overall?</li>\n<li>How easy is it to make a claim?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you don’t end up switching from your current policy, seeking out new homeowners insurance can be a great way to reassure yourself that you’re getting the best coverage possible for your budget.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Enter your address</a> to get a quick a quote or talk to a representative by giving us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">(855) 717-0022</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>For the last three wildfire seasons (2018, 2019, and 2020), Californians have seen extremely high wildfire activity.</p>\n<p>How high? The Camp Fire racked up $16.65 billion in claims and expenses. And the damage from the 2020 wildfire season is still being tallied, but estimates put it in the <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/california-wildfires-cost-of-cal-fire-stanford-wildfire-research/6897462/\">$10 billion range</a>.</p>\n<p>The rising costs of <a href=\"/blog/california-wildfire-statistics/\">damage from wildfires</a> means that insurance providers are paying more in claims, which means they’re turning to their insurance providers – called reinsurers – with more claims on their policies. These reinsurers, which insure insurance companies, are feeling the pinch.</p>\n<p>That’s because reinsurers pay out not just for wildfire claims but also for other disaster-related claims: <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">floods</a>, typhoons, etc. So in years when several severe weather events cause serious damage around the world, reinsurers get hit hard.</p>\n<p>To manage their risk exposure, they typically raise prices for their customers (insurance companies), who in turn raise prices for homeowners or send nonrenewal notices, effectively <a href=\"/blog/cancelled-homeowners-insurance/\">canceling homeowners policies</a>. In fact, <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">nonrenewals in California</a> have increased <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/As-California-wildfire-risk-increases-insurance-15659805.php\">more than 31 percent since 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is a problem for those who live in areas with wildfire risk exposure. The good news is that if your current insurance provider sends you a nonrenewal notice or raises premiums beyond what you can afford, there are steps you can take to keep yourself covered for wildfire damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isfireinsurancemandatoryincalifornia\">Is Fire Insurance Mandatory in California?</h2>\n<p>Before we get to steps for finding more affordable fire insurance, let’s first address another question: do you even need it? While there is no state-level law requiring homeowners to have fire insurance, most mortgage lenders do require it as a condition of the loan. So if you have a mortgage on your house, it’s safe to assume that fire insurance is mandatory.</p>\n<p>Even if you own your home free and clear, carrying fire insurance is the safest option. Fires can spark from shorted-out appliances, lightning storms, neighbors’ candle use, and dozens of other activities you have no control over. Fire insurance helps make sure you and your family can live normally even if a disaster hits.</p>\n<p>Fire insurance is included in most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">standard homeowners insurance policies</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at how <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California homeowners</a> can find affordable fire insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1shoparoundforfireinsurance\">1. Shop Around for Fire Insurance</h2>\n<p>It’s a good idea to shop around for fire insurance even if you don’t live in California – or if you live in a region of the state that’s not prone to wildfires. In fact, it’s a good idea to shop around for just about everything, and fire insurance is no exception.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search online.</strong> Some newer insurance providers (like us!) sell directly to customers and don’t work with outside brokers to keep costs low. We’re also able to offer better rates than traditional insurance companies because we build risk models <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">based on granular data</a>, which lets us price coverage on a per-homeowner basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask friends for recommendations.</strong> If you have friends and family in California, ask them about companies they’ve worked with to insure their homes. Once you have a list of recommendations, start gathering quotes to compare.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, once you’ve explored additional coverage options, you’ll find one that works for your home and your budget. If you don’t, move on to the next step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2considernonadmittedfireinsurancecarriers\">2. Consider Non-Admitted Fire Insurance Carriers</h2>\n<p>Most of the insurance companies you’ve heard of are “admitted” carriers, which means they’ve been approved by a state’s insurance department. If the carrier went bankrupt, the state would cover payments for claims on active policies.</p>\n<p>Non-admitted carriers are not approved by a state’s insurance department. They’re less regulated so they can take on more risk. Non-admitted insurance carriers may be the only workable solution for someone in a high-risk wildfire zone.</p>\n<p>Non-admitted carriers are also sometimes called surplus carriers or specialty carriers. If you’re unable to find fire insurance through admitted carriers for your California home, see what some non-admitted carriers offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3callthecaliforniainsurancehelpline\">3. Call the California Insurance Helpline</h2>\n<p>If even after considering non-admitted carriers you can’t find a fire insurance policy to cover your home, it’s time to call California’s insurance helpline at 1-800-927-HELP.</p>\n<p>This line is maintained by <a href=\"http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0500-about-us/05-contact/\">California’s Department of Insurance</a> and is designed to help California residents figure out how to find adequate insurance. A helpline worker might point you toward the FAIR plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4considercaliforniafairplanfireinsurance\">4. Consider California FAIR Plan Fire Insurance</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/\">California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements</a> (FAIR) plan is an insurer of last resort. Its website explicitly states that it is designed only for those homeowners who have made a “diligent effort” to find coverage elsewhere.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find that coverage, though, the FAIR plan may be able to offer the fire insurance you need. If you do go this route, it’s important to understand a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You’re responsible for knowing how much coverage you need.</strong> This isn’t what you’d experience with mainstream insurance providers. At a provider like Kin, you’d work with a representative who would help you understand the value of your home, your risk exposure, and the amount and type of coverage you need. In other words, the insurance provider is the one who worries that you’re getting enough coverage. Not so with the FAIR plan. If you get insurance through FAIR, you’ll have to calculate yourself how much coverage to get. You may want to work with an insurance broker to do this. Luckily, the <a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/index.php/find-a-broker/\">California FAIR plan’s website explains how to find a broker</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>California FAIR plan fire insurance doesn’t cover theft or liability.</strong> In this way, it’s different from standard homeowners insurance, which includes coverage for both <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">theft</a> and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability</a>. If you purchase a policy through the FAIR plan, be sure to consider additional coverage to manage your other risks.</li>\n<li><strong>California FAIR plan coverage is limited to $1.5 million.</strong> If the cost of rebuilding your home is more than that, you’ll have to find supplemental coverage or attempt to self-insure by saving enough cash to make up the difference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whattoexpectfromcaliforniafireinsuranceprices\">What to Expect from California Fire Insurance Prices</h2>\n<p>If you live in California and haven’t yet heard from your homeowners insurance provider, you may be one of the lucky ones – it’s possible your policy will be renewed with no major premium increases. In fact, many homeowners in areas recently impacted by wildfires may be protected from cancellations or nonrenewals for a year. <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/140-catastrophes/MandatoryOneYearMoratoriumNonRenewals.cfm\">Insurance Commissioner Richardo Lara placed a freeze on nonrenewals</a> for wildfire risk for one year from the date of the area’s emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Individual cases may vary, though. One woman <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-californians-could-lose-home-insurance-after-wildfires-11572613200\">interviewed by the Wall Street Journal</a> noted that, after getting a nonrenewal notice for a $2,350 policy, the only replacement policy she could find cost $18,000.</p>\n<p>While that cost is extreme, it is likely less than the cost of rebuilding your home from scratch without insurance.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about whether Kin can cover your California home, <a href=\"/\">enter your address to find out</a>.</p>"

These disasters can and do spread across most western states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtomakeafiresafetyplanforyourhome\">How to Make a Fire Safety Plan for Your Home</h2>\n<p>Fire season used to be <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/impacts/infographic-wildfires-climate-change.html\">five weeks</a> long in the 1970s, then more than seven months by the early aughts. This spring, Vicki Christiansen, the chief of the US Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, told NPR, “It’s always fire season now.”</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/05/729720938/1-billion-acres-at-risk-for-catastrophic-wildfires-u-s-forest-service-warns\">over one billion acres</a> at risk for catastrophic burning this year, it’s important for homeowners to be aware of their local fire risk and to create a fire prevention and safety plan.</p>\n<p>Part of that plan means brushing up on your homeowners insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your have your home insurance company's contact information readily available.</li>\n<li>Understand how homeowners insurance covers fire damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find out how to anticipate fire risks, how to make a fire safety plan, and how to ensure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> protects your house.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It’s always fire season now.\"Vicki Christiansen, Chief of the US Department of Agriculture's Forest Service</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"knowyourlocalfireriskstakeprecautions\">Know Your Local Fire Risks &amp; Take Precautions</h2>\n<p>So what are the most common causes of house fires? They’re not all that surprising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooking fires</li>\n<li>Heating fires, including boiler or gas furnace explosions</li>\n<li>Open flames from fireplaces or candles</li>\n<li>Indoor smoking and cigarettes</li>\n<li>Wildfires, most of which are caused by human error</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you live in the woods of New England, you’re less likely to be worried about wildfires than a Californian, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t practice the same kind of diligence.</p>\n<p>All homeowners should take these fire prevention measures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install smoke detectors on each floor of the home and in utility rooms, rooms with fireplaces, rooms with appliances, and crawlspaces.</li>\n<li>Test all smoke detectors twice a year.</li>\n<li>Clean fireplaces at least once a year to prevent build-ups that can lead to fires.</li>\n<li>Kitchen fires are very common, so remove clutter and flammable items in and around cooking appliances.</li>\n<li>Never leave a burning candle or cigarette unattended.</li>\n<li>Keep candles and burners far from flammable materials like paper and curtains.</li>\n<li>Inspect outlets, all extension cords, surge protectors, and all cords to ensure there’s no fraying to help prevent electrical fires.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wherever you live, it’s also a good idea to <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">keep your trees trimmed</a> so that there are no branches hanging over your roof or within 30 feet of your home. This is your \"defensible space,\" a buffer between a dwelling and the grass, trees, and shrubs. Creating this space may protect your home from catching fire from direct flame or radiant heat.</p>\n<p>If you live in California, you may have to comply with <a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\">defensible space ordinances</a> to help curb the spread of wildfires. These regulations vary depending on where you live, but many counties require homeowners to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove all dead plants, grass, weeds, leaves, and pine needles from the yard, roof, and rain gutters.</li>\n<li>Keep trees trimmed so that branches are 10 feet from other trees.</li>\n<li>Keep dead branches 10 feet away from the chimney.</li>\n<li>Relocate wood piles so they are 100 feet away from the home, deck, or other structures.</li>\n<li>Remove or prune flammable plants, shrubs, and vegetation near windows and decks.</li>\n<li>Create a separation between trees and shrubs and outdoor furniture, wood piles, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prepareyourhomefortheworstcasescenario\">Prepare Your Home for the Worst-Case Scenario</h2>\n<p>If your house does catch on fire, your first priority should be to get out of the house safely as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>If your fire risk is external – like a wildfire – you’ll want to leave your house in the best condition to avoid a total loss. If you have time, these steps can help cover your bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove combustible items from your yard and store them in a safe place. These items may include firewood, fuel canisters, barbecue grills, and yard waste.</li>\n<li>Fill any large vessels with water to slow or discourage fire – pools, tubs, or garbage cans should be full if you have the time to do so. It’s also a good idea to keep rain barrels.</li>\n<li>Close all vents, windows, and doors to prevent drafts.</li>\n<li>Shut off natural gas, fuel oil, or propane lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Human error is the most common cause of house fires.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"makeafireplanandpracticeit\">Make a Fire Plan and Practice It</h2>\n<p>Your fire plan should address what you’ll do, where you’ll go, and how you’ll communicate with your family members and the outside world (including first responders) if there’s a fire in the area. Beyond making sure everyone knows to stop, drop, and roll, here are five steps to prepare your family for a house fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1stockup\">1. Stock Up</h3>\n<p>In case you have to shelter in place, keep a stock of drinking water and canned food to tide you over.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2testyoursmokealarms\">2. Test Your Smoke Alarms</h3>\n<p>Test your smoke alarms regularly. If you don’t have them attached to a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centralized alarm system</a>, you may want to consider upgrading (bonus: doing so may come with <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">home insurance discounts</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"3haveyouremergencybagspacked\">3. Have Your Emergency Bags Packed</h3>\n<p>Pack “go bags” for the family. One administrative bag should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directions to a safe place</li>\n<li>A list of personal contacts (in case your cell phone runs out of battery)</li>\n<li>Your driver's license (and the rest of your wallet)</li>\n<li>The deed to your house</li>\n<li>Proof of insurance</li>\n<li>Passports and social security cards, if you keep these documents in the house</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4practiceyourplanwithafamilyfiredrill\">4. Practice Your Plan with a Family Fire Drill</h3>\n<p>Make sure everyone in your family knows what the smoke alarms sound like and can identify the signs of a fire.</p>\n<p>To test your escape routes, run family fire drills to make sure everyone knows two ways out of every room in the house. This may sound extreme, but it won’t seem impractical if you ever find yourself in danger.</p>\n<p>As part of your drill, make sure you practice getting to your designated meet-up spot. If you live in a multifamily building with an elevator, it’s imperative that everyone knows to take the stairs or knows where to wait for a rescue if they’re unable to.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have a plan to <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">get your pets to safety</a>, too!</p>\n<h3 id=\"5testyouremergencycommunicationplan\">5. Test Your Emergency Communication Plan</h3>\n<p>You should have an emergency communication plan that accounts for what you’ll do if you get separated without your cell phones. Make sure everyone knows who to contact in case they can’t make it to the meetup spot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>90%​ of wildfires are caused by humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"makesureyourhouseisproperlyinsuredforfires\">Make Sure Your House Is Properly Insured for Fires</h2>\n<p>Fires are a covered peril in most standard homeowners insurance policies. There are a couple of common situations in which you may want additional coverage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you do not live in your house, you’ll likely need a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP-3 insurance policy</a>, which covers the structure in case of a fire.</li>\n<li>If you live in an area where wildfires are common, discuss which <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> are covered by your policy with your homeowners insurance company. If it’s not included, you may want to get additional earth movement insurance. This may seem unrelated at first, but mudslides commonly occur in areas that have been ravaged by wildfires where erosion is a serious problem. Part of the reason for this elevated risk is that scorched earth has more trouble absorbing water, which means a whole level of ground cover that is easily moved if those wildfires are followed by a rainy season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s worth noting that your homeowners insurance premium will be impacted by the <a href=\"/glossary/protection-class/\">protection class</a> of the area where you live. The protection class is determined by the Insurance Services Organization, and it can be difficult to change your home’s protection class on your own because so much of it is determined by the local infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have the right coverage for the risks near you. Talk to your homeowners insurance company to make sure your current level of coverage is appropriate for your home, any outbuildings on your property, and the contents of your house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetakeawaycontrolwhatyoucan\">The Takeaway: Control What You Can</h2>\n<p>Like most disasters, fires are hard to predict and difficult to prevent. The Insurance Information Institute says that <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-wildfires\">90 percent</a> of wildfires are caused by humans. Be cautious in your home and in the wild. Be attentive to flames wherever they’re present. There’s not much you can do to prevent a wildfire or an unknown electrical issue hiding in your walls, but you can take care of your home and maintain a working smoke detector system. Do everything in your power to <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/home-fire-preparedness.html\">prepare your home and your family</a> for a worst-case scenario.</p>"

    body: "<p>As if the pandemic, hurricanes, <em>and</em> wildfires weren’t enough, 2020 seems to have yet another horror up its sleeve: the fire tornado.</p>\n<p>Called a firenado for short, this rare event is a by-product of the wildfire and <a href=\"/blog/brief-history-of-wildfires/\">wildfire conditions</a>. The heat of the fire is so intense that it creates an actual tornado.</p>\n<p>If you’ve never heard of a fire tornado before, you’re not alone. August 15, 2020 marked the <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/weather-news/article244993335.html\">first time in history</a> that the US National Weather Service issued a warning about a fire-induced tornado near Loyalton, California.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisafiretornado\">What Is a Fire Tornado?</h2>\n<p>Fire tornadoes are vortices of flame and ash formed through extreme heat, turbulent winds, and uneven terrain. Currents of hot air generated by the fire flow upward, and air rushes in from the sides (i.e., an inflow jet), causing a horizontal wind. Air converges from all directions into the location of the updraft, and sometimes wind shear (air flowing in different directions) enters the mix. That’s the source of the fire tornado’s initial rotation.</p>\n<p>Once it gathers strength and speed, the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/extreme-events-fire-tornado\">fire tornado creates its own weather system</a>, concentrating the vortex in the lower atmosphere. Its vortex pulls up embers, ash, flames, dirt, and debris. It can have winds exceeding 140 miles per hour and last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Some fire tornadoes form a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, or a fire-generated thunderstorm, which doubles the effect of the fire by adding more heat into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>These are extremely dangerous, not just for the damage the vortex causes, but for the ash and embers flung to other areas that start more fires. The fire tornado’s path is generally unpredictable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedifferencebetweenfiretornadoesandfirewhirls\">The Difference Between Fire Tornadoes and Fire Whirls</h2>\n<p>While both fire whirls and fire tornadoes start with strong updrafts from the fire and inflows from the fire itself, the difference is intensity and size. A fire tornado generates so much heat that it forms an actual tornado.</p>\n<p>A fire whirl, also called a fire devil, is usually a relatively small whirlwind on the ground made of flame or ash. It’s made visible by smoke and caused by rising intense heat and turbulent winds, forming whirling eddies of air that can suck in debris and combustible gases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherearefiretornadoeshappening\">Where Are Fire Tornadoes Happening?</h2>\n<p>At the time of publishing, the Loyalton Fire in California currently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/loyalton-fire-tornado.html\">burns at only five percent containment</a> with more than 20,000 acres already burned. On August 15, 2020, this fire produced a fire tornado, triggering a tornado warning for the area with funnel winds thought to exceed 60 miles per hour.</p>\n<p>The danger is in the unpredictability of the vortex. Firefighters could work in what appears to be a safe fireline, but the winds can change in an instant and bring the formation right on top of them.</p>\n<p>With the area just hitting the prime of fire season, officials and residents are concerned that the hot weather conditions could bring more fire tornadoes.</p>\n<p>True fire tornadoes have only been documented twice before this. The first <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/fire-tornado/11014364\">confirmed violent fire tornado</a> was during the 2003 Canberra bushfires in Canberra, Australia. Rated F3, the tornado and fire claimed four lives and injured 492 people.</p>\n<p>The second was the Carr Fire in Redding, California in 2018, where the fire tornado was rated as an EF3 tornado, and its <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2018/12/07/511372.htm\">winds exceeded 143 miles per hour</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverfiretornadoes\">Does Home Insurance Cover Fire Tornadoes?</h2>\n<p>Yes, fire tornadoes are usually covered by standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. A typical <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> can cover both tornado and wildfire damage to the home, other structures, and belongings. This kind of policy covers all events except those explicitly excluded by the policy, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earth movement, such as an earthquake, sinkhole, and mudflow.</li>\n<li>Water damage from flood, sewer backup, or water seeping in through the foundation.</li>\n<li>Demolition of your home required by law to bring it to code.</li>\n<li>Seizure or demolition by a government agency or authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most home insurance policies at minimum cover these 16 perils:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge of water or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing of household systems</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even before fire tornados, California homeowners near the wildfire zones were feeling the heat. As wildfire season grows in length and intensity each year, insurers willing to offer affordable wildfire coverage are becoming more scarce. Given that nearly <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2019/09/12/california-has-most-homes-extreme-risk-wildfire-damage-season/2283377001/\">776,000 homes</a> are at extreme risk of wildfire damage and face about $220 billion in potential damages, that’s no small matter.</p>\n<p>Many of these homes <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">don’t qualify for traditional homeowners insurance</a> and can only get a California FAIR Plan policy.</p>\n<p>But stay tuned – <a href=\"/blog/california-homeowners-better-insurance/\">we’re changing that</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Nothing quite captures the spirit of the 4th of July like fireworks – the brightness! The clamor! The splendor! We strongly recommend you leave the pyrotechnics to the professionals, but we also realize there’s a reason the US imports $332 million worth of fireworks a year – folks are going to set them off even if it’s not safe (or sometimes legal. You rebels).</p>\n<p>But you should take care if you meddle with fireworks. At the end of the day, these are explosives, even if they are the charming variety. Fireworks sent <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Seasonal-fire-causes/Fireworks\">9,100 people</a> to the ER for injuries in 2018. More than a third of those were injuries to the eye or head.</p>\n<p>In addition to physical harm, fireworks can get out of hand and cause a lot of property damage. Here’s what you should know about how your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> may respond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverfireworkdamage\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Firework Damage?</h2>\n<p>Given that fireworks caused <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Seasonal-fire-causes/Fireworks\">19,500 fires</a> in 2018, including 1,900 structure fires and $105 million in direct property damage, claims are a real risk. There are three ways fireworks may trigger a home insurance claim:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You set off fireworks that damage your own home.</li>\n<li>You set off fireworks that damage someone else’s home.</li>\n<li>Your fireworks cause someone bodily harm.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whether your home insurance policy covers these situations is another story. Your policy language and the facts surrounding the loss ultimately determine whether your coverage applies.</p>\n<p>For example, most <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">home insurance policies cover fires</a>. But if the fire was caused by illegal activity (e.g., you set off fireworks in a state where they’re not legal or you intentionally aimed a firework at your home, someone else’s home, or a person), home insurance likely <em>wouldn’t</em> cover it.</p>\n<p>If your house catches fire because of fireworks someone else lit, <a href=\"/blog/when-to-call-home-insurance-company/\">contact your insurance company</a>.</p>\n<p>For reference, some or all types of consumer fireworks that meet federal regulations are <a href=\"https://www.americanpyro.com/state-law-directory\">legal in 46 states</a> plus the District of Columbia. Illinois, Vermont, and Ohio only allow sparklers. They are outright illegal in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>Even if consumer fireworks are legal where you live, you may need a permit to set them off yourself. Make sure you know your state and city firework laws before you engage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverfireworkinjuries\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Firework Injuries?</h2>\n<p>Again, it depends on the circumstances and your policy’s language. While homeowners insurance includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> to help pay for your legal expenses when you accidentally cause someone an injury or property damage, it won’t cover illegal acts (like if you intentionally caused someone harm or the circumstances surrounding the harm were illegal).</p>\n<p>A claims adjuster will likely want to know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Were the fireworks legal?</li>\n<li>Who lit the fireworks?</li>\n<li>Did the fireworks function as intended?</li>\n<li>How much experience do you have using fireworks?</li>\n<li>Were the neighbors also setting off fireworks?</li>\n<li>Did your neighbors okay the use of fireworks?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regardless, if someone is hurt because of the fireworks you set off, you should tend to their medical needs and contact your insurance company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fireworksafetytips\">Firework Safety Tips</h2>\n<p>Our VP of claims says you shouldn’t use fireworks unless you can do so safely and legally. Make sure folks are clear of any potential contact from the fireworks.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning to use fireworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure the type of fireworks you want to use are legal.</li>\n<li>Strictly follow all directions for use.</li>\n<li>Plan the trajectory and landing areas to make sure they’re free of debris and structures. Remember: embers from fireworks can travel for miles.</li>\n<li>Only use fireworks outdoors and in a clear space.</li>\n<li>Keep your audience at a safe distance from the point of ignition.</li>\n<li>Keep a hose, bucket of water, or a fire extinguisher nearby.</li>\n<li>Keep your wits about you – drinking alcohol and lighting fireworks is a recipe for disaster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is damaged, call the fire department and try your best to (safely!) prevent your home from experiencing further damage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-safety-checklist/\">Stay safe</a> out there, friends, and have a happy Fourth of July!</p>"

    body: "<p>Looking to buy your first home? It's a huge milestone – and one that takes careful planning. These first time home buyer tips can help you achieve your goal of homeownership faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startsavingnow\">Start Saving Now</h2>\n<p>When you buy a home, you generally have to come up with a sizable down payment. This can range anywhere from three to 20 percent of the cost of the home. To put that amount in perspective, for every $100,000 of home you purchase, you need anywhere from $3,000 to $20,000 for your down payment.</p>\n<p>This can be one of the biggest obstacles to buying a new home. If you can’t save that much in the timeframe you’re looking to buy, and you don’t qualify for a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">zero-down loan program</a>, you may have to look at other options, like getting a gift from your parents or tapping into your 401(k). Either way, make sure you’re prepared for the down payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decidewhatyourbudgetis\">Decide What Your Budget Is</h2>\n<p>It’s one thing to peruse the pages of Zillow and fantasize about the home you’ll buy, and another thing altogether to know which homes you can afford. Use one of the many online mortgage calculators that estimate your monthly mortgage payment based on the cost of the home, downpayment, and interest rates.</p>\n<p>Once you have an idea of how much your mortgage might be, you can get a better handle on the types of homes you might actually be able to buy. This makes your search much more focused and can help you make decisions further on down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raiseyourcreditscore\">Raise Your Credit Score</h2>\n<p>Most lenders prefer credit scores of 680 or higher, but the Federal Housing Administration accepts credit scores as low as 500 if you can put 10 percent down. If your credit is less than perfect, you want to work on improving it now. This may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dealing with late payments or delinquencies.</li>\n<li>Disputing errors.</li>\n<li>Paying down debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only does your credit score determine your ability to qualify for a loan, but it also determines the rate of the loan. Basically, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate is. That’s important because better rates can save you thousands in interest over the course of the loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"researchyourmortgageoptions\">Research Your Mortgage Options</h2>\n<p>Learn what types of <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage options</a> there are and decide which is the best option for you. One place to look is towards the federal governments. It’s home loan programs are usually designed with first time home buyers in mind, including programs from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Housing Administration.</li>\n<li>US Department of Veterans Affairs.</li>\n<li>US Department of Agriculture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These loan programs generally have lower credit and down payment requirements. However, if you have great credit and enough for a 20 percent down payment, you might find your best rates in conventional mortgages. Knowing what you are most likely to qualify for can help you best plan for your new home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findarealtor\">Find a Realtor</h2>\n<p>Even if you aren’t ready to buy just yet, you may want to develop a relationship with a realtor that you trust. They can help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand different market conditions that suggest good times to buy.</li>\n<li>Point you in the right direction for neighborhoods to consider.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for your perfect home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to be able to trust that your realtor has your best interests in mind. Get to know them before you shop in earnest to get a sense of how a working relationship might go.</p>\n<p>For more pointers, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">22 Questions to Ask When Buying a House</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"researchneighborhoods\">Research Neighborhoods</h2>\n<p>While your realtor points you in the direction of neighborhoods and homes that fit your needs, it’s best to do your own due diligence. Depending on your top concerns, you probably want to look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Area schools.</li>\n<li>Crime.</li>\n<li>Local eateries.</li>\n<li>Parks.</li>\n<li>Distance from your work or school.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When researching neighborhoods, you need to determine where you feel safe, how conducive the area is to your lifestyle, and whether it fits your work needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getapreapprovalletter\">Get a Pre-Approval Letter</h2>\n<p>Many agree that before you even start shopping for a new home, you should talk to a mortgage broker and get your loan pre-approved. The pre-approval letter makes you a better prospect as a buyer because sellers know you’re serious and can meet the loan requirements. Some won’t even accept an offer without a pre-approval letter.</p>\n<p>This is different from using online loan calculators. While those can get thinking about a budget, a pre-approval letter defines it because the lender factors in your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal credit.</li>\n<li>Debt-to-income ratio.</li>\n<li>Income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this helps determine the top end of what you can afford. Plus, it doesn’t commit you to a particular lender or loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planforclosingcosts\">Plan for Closing Costs</h2>\n<p>We’ve already talked about the down payment, but you also need to save money for the <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">closing costs</a>. These can be anywhere from two to five percent of the purchase price and includes fees like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li>Title insurance.</li>\n<li>Appraisals.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes you can roll some or all of your closing costs into the final loan balance. While it’s nice to not have to come up with the extra cash, you should run the numbers to see how much this may cost you in additional interest. In most cases, you’re better off paying these costs at closing if you can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"budgetforhomeownersinsurance\">Budget for Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Depending on how far along you are in your home buying journey, you may have already realized that you need to factor the <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a> into your play. Mortgage lenders usually require you to get a policy before they offer a loan.</p>\n<p>In many cases, you can have your homeowners insurance premium paid from an escrow account that holds the balance until the renewals take place. Whether or not you choose to do this, make sure you shop around to get the best rate to keep your monthly costs down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnabouthomeownerstaxbreaks\">Learn About Homeowners Tax Breaks</h2>\n<p>Homeownership entitles you to some <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">tax breaks</a> you'll want to explore. For example, you can deduct your property taxes as well as the interest you pay on the mortgage. Closing costs may also be tax deductible, but you should talk to a tax adviser to determine which are – if any. Making the most of tax breaks can help homeowners pay for repairs and upkeep.</p>\n<p>Planning ahead is essential to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">making homeownership affordable</a>.

    body: "<p>Wind mitigation is essential in Florida. In fact, the state’s high winds and water intrusion are the top contributors to Florida’s disproportionate amount of insurance claims. But you can protect your home by incorporating the same research-based recommendations endorsed by the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida Department of Financial Services.</li>\n<li>Florida Division of Emergency Management.</li>\n<li>Florida’s Foundation.</li>\n<li>Florida Alliance for Safe Homes.</li>\n<li>Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find these recommendations in Florida wind mitigation forms – that is, the standard inspection documents that help determine how wind resistant your home is.</p>\n<p>Even better? A wind-resistant home can help you save even while <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida homeowners insurance rates are going up</a>. The state requires insurance companies to offer discounts when consumers take steps toward wind mitigation</p>\n<h2 id=\"7waystotellhowwindresistantyourhomeis\">7 ways to tell how wind resistant your home is</h2>\n<p>The key form for Florida homeowners is the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/OIR-B1-1802.pdf\">Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection form</a>. It’s the one inspectors use to assess how wind resistant your home is, and it has seven parts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1buildingcode\">1. Building code</h3>\n<p>What year was your home built? Homes built prior to 2001 were not held to the same building standards as those circa 2002 to the present. If your home is older, you might need to do some upgrades to strengthen your home against hurricane winds. Doing so could help you <a href=\"/blog/1-tip-to-lower-florida-homeowners-insurance/\">lower your homeowners insurance costs</a>. Miami-Dade and Broward counties have their own set of guidelines because they are closest to the eye of the storm.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_535166296.jpg?width=1938&name=shutterstock_535166296.jpg\" alt=\"A worker repairing a clay tile roof\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"2roofcovering\">2. Roof covering</h3>\n<p>The material your roof is made of helps determine how resilient it is to wind and water damage. The most common materials for roofs are often asphalt/fiberglass shingle, concrete/clay tile, and metal. Insurance companies will consider what your roof is made out of and how old those materials are to determine what wind mitigation discounts your home is eligible for. Newer materials are typically built to stronger building code equivalent standards.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_396689752.jpg?width=1938&name=shutterstock_396689752.jpg\" alt=\"A man stands on a metal roof, drilling a hole\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"3roofdeckattachment\">3. Roof-deck attachment</h3>\n<p>This measures on a scale of 1 (weakest) to 3 (strongest) how well your roof is attached to the rafters of the frame on your home. To qualify for wind mitigation credits, it’s essential to have a roof that has the proper amount of nails with the proper length and design to withstand the most wind. All homes built 2002 to present fall into Category C, which is the best option.</p>\n<p>For the overachievers out there, that means plywood/OSB roof sheathing with a minimum thickness of 7/16 inch attached to the roof truss/rafter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_379565095.jpg?width=1938&name=shutterstock_379565095.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of an attic being repaired\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"4rooftowallattachment\">4. Roof-to-wall attachment</h3>\n<p>How well is your roof attached to the walls? This is quantified on the form by eight options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Toenails.</li>\n<li>Clips.</li>\n<li>Single wraps.</li>\n<li>Double wraps.</li>\n<li>Anchor bolt.</li>\n<li>Other.</li>\n<li>Unknown.</li>\n<li>No attic access.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Double wraps are considered the strongest, whereas toenails provide the least protection. Companies are unable to provide discounts when there is no attic access to determine the roof-to-wall attachment. If the attachment type is unknown or falls into the other category, your company should be able to assess the photographs in the inspection to determine whether or not you qualify for a credit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_714997576.jpg?width=1938&name=shutterstock_714997576.jpg\" alt=\"A brown shingle roof viewed from above\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"5roofgeometry\">5. Roof geometry</h3>\n<p>This is another way to say, “What is your <a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">roof shape</a>?” The options on the form are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hip roof.</li>\n<li>Flat roof.</li>\n<li>Other.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A hip roof is ideal, as all sides slope downward to aid in resisting clashes with hurricane winds. A flat roof has one or more sides with a vertical angle, a straight dropdown. This provides a strong path of resistance for high winds and can prompt more forceful direct impact, so insurance folks frown on flat roofs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6secondarywaterresistance\">6. Secondary water resistance</h3>\n<p>This is essentially an additional layer put onto homes post 2001 that provides additional water protection and is attached under the shingles. You either have it or you don’t. Secondary water resistance is not something folks usually invest in unless they’re installing a new roof.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/shutterstock_508650967.jpg?width=1938&name=shutterstock_508650967.jpg\" alt=\"A two-story coastal home with hurricane shutters\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"7openingprotection\">7. Opening protection</h3>\n<p>This part of a wind mitigation inspection focuses on “glazed openings” (glass) and “non-glazed openings” (entry and garage doors). You want to have <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a>, preferably with <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> or tempered glass to reduce the chances for flying debris breaking through and compromising the entire pressure barrier of your home.</p>\n<p>This portion of the inspection basically wants to know if you have impact-rated materials installed on every glass unit in the home (skylights and glass blocks included), if your entry doors have the proper sealing, and if every attachment is properly secured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bottomline\">Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Assessing your home’s wind risk and mitigating against it is an important step in protecting your home from the costs that follow dangerous storms and hurricanes. Budgeting for these upgrades now can ultimately save money on <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure if your home qualifies a wind mitigation discount, talk to your Kin representative.

    body: "<p>In every life, a little rain must fall. But when a light drizzle turns into a deluge, then you may be at risk for flash flooding. These dangerous weather events often catch people unprepared – in part because flash floods move so quickly, but also because they can start some distance away from your location.</p>\n<p>Understanding what flash flooding is and what to do if your area is threatened by one is important for keeping your family safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisflashflooding\">What is flash flooding?</h2>\n<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/phi/FlashFloodingDefinition\">defines flash flooding</a> as a flood that begins within six hours of a heavy rainstorm. However, the NWS also claims that flash floods can occur within three hours of a storm or other cause.</p>\n<p>That’s an important distinction to note. While flash floods are most commonly associated with heavy rain and slow-moving thunderstorms, they might also happen if a dam, levee, or even an ice jam breaks.</p>\n<p>Whatever the cause, flash flooding can do considerable damage. Fast rising floodwaters have moved boulders, knocked down bridges, and destroyed homes. Even a foot of water can be strong enough to float most cars. Add another foot, and you may see a truck or two floating by.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheredoflashfloodsoccur\">Where do flash floods occur?</h2>\n<p>If you take away anything from this article, let it be this: flash floods can happen anywhere. For instance, a thunderstorm may cause a river to overflow, putting downstream homes at risk. But debris could just as easily dam up the same river and cause flooding upstream.</p>\n<p>That said, certain areas are more prone to flash floods. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Areas near rivers and other bodies of water.</li>\n<li>Mountains where steep slopes may cause rapid runoff.</li>\n<li>Densely populated places where construction limits the amount of water the ground can absorb.</li>\n<li>Coastal areas where hurricanes are common.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another area with flash flood risk are places near dams and levees that may break or overflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoknowifaflashfloodiscoming\">How to know if a flash flood Is coming</h2>\n<p>In some cities, you can sign up to have emergency alerts sent to your cell phone to notify you of possible threats so you can take appropriate action. These typically include flood advisories, watches, and warnings as well as flash flood warning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodadvisory\">What is a flood advisory?</h3>\n<p>A flood advisory is a notification sent to residents by local authorities that raises the concern of flooding. Typically, indicates that the current weather situation may cause flooding that could result in significant inconvenience and dangerous conditions if people are not careful. Advisories can escalate to a watch or warning if conditions worsen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodwatch\">What is a flood watch?</h3>\n<p>A flood watch usually means the local authorities believe weather conditions favor flooding This may mean they’ve seen an extreme flow of water into a dry area or rapidly rising levels in nearby bodies of water. A watch usually doesn’t mean that a flood will happen, but people should prepare for that possibility. Moreover, residents are urged to pay attention to flood watches because they’re often a precursor to a flash flood warning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodwarning\">What is a flood warning?</h3>\n<p>A flood warning indicates that a flood has already occurred or is very likely to occur. People in low-lying areas need to move to higher ground and should listen for information about <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">mandatory evacuations</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisaflashfloodwarning\">What is a flash flood warning?</h3>\n<p>A flash flood warning is the most serious flood alert authorities can usually give. This warning indicates that either enough rain has fallen for a flash flood to occur or flash flooding has already happened in the area. As with a flood warning, people in low areas may need to evacuate.</p>\n<p>If your area doesn’t have an emergency alert system, then you want to tune into your local radio or television stations to find out exactly what the threat is and what you should do. These broadcast centers will have the most up-to-date information about the weather conditions to help keep you safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoinaflashflood\">What to do in a flash flood</h2>\n<p>The key to keeping your family safe in an emergency is to plan ahead. For example, you may want to make a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> that includes steps like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting together a disaster supply kit.</li>\n<li>Knowing where shelters are and the routes to get to them.</li>\n<li>Having a contact list handy.</li>\n<li>Practicing your plan with your family.</li>\n<li>Moving electronics to upper floors in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a flash flood, you may need to head for higher ground, so be sure you’ve identified spots that fit that description.</p>\n<p>In addition to planning ahead, you want to pay attention to what’s happening around you. Keep an eye out for rapidly rising water and leave your radio or television tuned to the news. If you do encounter water, be cautious. Floodwaters are not just muddy, which means you can’t know what’s in it, but they’re often contaminated so keep your children and pets out of it. Heed the advice from the NWS to “Turn around, don’t drown.”</p>\n<p>One more note about preparing for a flash flood: <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> generally doesn’t not cover flood damage. So the final step to protecting your home and family is to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Getting your life back in order after a flood can be daunting enough. The last thing you want to do is to spend a ton of time trying to understand the ins and outs of how your insurance claim will be paid. So let’s simplify it and take a look at how to file a flood insurance claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofileafloodinsuranceclaim\">How to file a flood insurance claim</h2>\n<p>Every insurance company has its own method for filing flood claims. We’re hoping this high-level breakdown of how the flood claims process works can help you more easily navigate your own insurer’s procedures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contactyourfloodinsurer\">Contact your flood insurer</h3>\n<p>Before you do anything, your first step should be to call your flood insurance company and alert it about the <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> to your home. That will initiate the paperwork you must complete and the adjustor’s visit so that you can get your insurance check as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Typically, you have up to 60 days after a flood to file your claim, but you don’t want to delay communicating with your insurance company. Letting your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> know about damage gets you the paperwork you need to move forward and helps ensure a covered claim is paid out quickly.</p>\n<p>You should also give your mortgage provider a call. The settlement for your claim may be paid out to both you and your mortgage company, depending on the terms of your mortgage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigateyourdamages\">Mitigate your damages</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> includes language that requires you to mitigate your damages. This means you have to do your best to minimize your losses. For example, you may be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stop water from coming in.</strong> If your home is already flooding, this might be difficult. But don’t worry, people at your insurance company typically understand this and want you to be safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Protecting your personal property.</strong> Where you can make a big impact is by moving personal items to higher levels in your home or up on countertops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important thing to remember is to stay safe. Do not go into your home until authorities allow it, and avoid coming into contact with floodwaters. It’s often contaminated and may hide other dangers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"documentyourdamages\">Document your damages</h3>\n<p>Your insurer will likely require some documentation before it can process your claim. The better your paper trail, the easier the flood claims process will be. (This is actually a pretty good rule to follow for most <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claims</a>!)</p>\n<p>You will need to document the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Loss of property.</strong> No matter how damaged, it is important to itemize every item affected by the flood on paper and via photograph for your records. This proves your losses and your required repairs or replacements. It also serves as evidence if you need to dispute your adjustor’s findings later on.</li>\n<li><strong>Repairs.</strong> You also want to document repairs once they’re underway. This allows you to contact your mortgage company and get the maximum amount of payout from the escrow allotted to your mortgage company (more on that soon).</li>\n<li><strong>Contact information.</strong> Keep contact information for anyone working on your home repairs in case your insurer needs to contact them.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"expecttheadjuster\">Expect the adjuster</h3>\n<p>Your insurer will likely send a <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> to assess your property losses. The adjuster’s job is to determine the damages that you’ve experienced. Typically, that means walking your property and looking at what was destroyed or needs repair. Your adjuster might also use a tool called a moisture meter to determine how high the floodwaters rose in your home.</p>\n<p>If possible, keep damaged items available for the adjuster to review. If you must get rid of items for safety purposes, be sure to take pictures or video of them. Remember that your documentation can help the adjuster make the right decisions about your claim.</p>\n<p>Once your property has been inspected, you can negotiate with the adjustor to submit an insurance claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getthepayout\">Get the payout</h3>\n<p>Though the exact process for your claims settlement depends on your insurance provider, the general payout process works like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your mortgage company gets a check for damage to the house.</strong> If you have a mortgage, the check for home repairs may be made out to both you and the mortgage lender. This condition is typically part of your mortgage contract and helps the lender ensure the repairs are made. Your lender will usually put the money in escrow to cover repairs as work is completed.</li>\n<li><strong>You get a check for damaged personal belongings.</strong> Your insurance company will initially send a check for the actual cash value of the damaged items, even if you have replacement cost insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>You get the remainder of your personal property settlement once you replace your items.</strong> If you have replacement cost coverage for your personal property, you’ll receive the full replacement cost of the items once you replace the damaged belongings and provide the receipts to your insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, if you have questions during the claims process, call your agent or your insurer for assistance.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in June 2018.

    body: "<p>If you’re selling or buying a house in a flood zone, it’s important to disclose and understand your property’s history with flood events.</p>\n<p>Do you know your home’s flood history? Unless you built the place yourself, the answer is probably no.</p>\n<p>Flood disclosure laws increasingly require homeowners to document the history of water damage and major storm damage on their properties.</p>\n<p>Consider the recent changes in Texas, where following the massive flood damage caused by <a href=\"https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2017-hurricane-harvey-facts\">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017, the state updated its legal disclosure requirements to be among the most thorough in the country.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, other states, including Mississippi and Florida, are flood-prone but lack clear requirements for disclosure. This puts potential homeowners at risk of unknowingly buying a house that has hidden structural damage.</p>\n<p>If you're selling your home, document and share any known history of flooding on your property, whether or not it's required by law. This will help future occupants ensure they have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> if a rainy day arrives.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you need to know about flood disclosures to make sure you’re prepared – even if you don't plan on selling your home anytime soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsaflooddisclosurelaw\">What’s a Flood Disclosure Law?</h2>\n<p>Flood disclosure laws require sellers to provide written disclosure of any flooding or water damage they are aware of. This disclosure might also denote whether the buyers will be required to carry a flood insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Disclosures impact both buyers and sellers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They ensure that <strong>homebuyers</strong> don’t purchase a home with hidden structural damage or go without necessary flood coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Sellers</strong> are required by some state laws to disclose the history of flooding on the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re unsure of your state’s flood disclosure rules, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is a good resource for <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/flood-disclosure-map\">flood disclosure laws by state</a>.</p>\n<p>The NRDC grades state disclosure laws on a few data points, but it also considers whether:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sellers are required to disclose their awareness of their property being damaged / impacted by flood issues.</li>\n<li>Flood insurance is required for the property at the time of the sale.</li>\n<li>Flood zone and floodway status disclosures are also required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why does it matter? If sellers fail to disclose this information in writing using the required form pre-contract, the contract of sale may be invalid.</p>\n<p>Simply put: this disclosure makes sure homebuyers can make an informed purchase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Flood disclosure laws require sellers provide written disclosure of any flooding or water damage they are aware of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"donationalflooddisclosurelawsexist\">Do National Flood Disclosure Laws Exist?</h2>\n<p>There is not currently a national flood disclosure law, but some legislators want to change that. And there is precedent for this kind of requirement.</p>\n<p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2017/01/17/home-sellers-should-disclose-flood-history-and-risk-to-buyers\">Pew discussed</a> how there is a standard for national disclosure, and that is the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/lead/real-estate-disclosures-about-potential-lead-hazards\">lead-based paint disclosure</a> which requires sellers and landlords to test and disclose lead-based paints in houses built before 1978. It’s dangerous and potentially fatal for homeowners to be exposed to lead paint over time, especially children.</p>\n<p>The same reasoning could be applied to floods: floods can be dangerous, too. And they are financially burdensome.</p>\n<p>If you were aware that a property had flooded for 15 of the past 20 years in the month of June, would you be as likely to buy it? Would or willing to pay the flood insurance premium that goes along with it? Perhaps not, depending on your financial situation.</p>\n<p>Homeowners today use a standard home inspection is to uncover hidden risks and to make sure that the closing price reflects the condition of the house (or any repairs that may be necessary.</p>\n<p>But this process has its limits: a home inspector can't look inside walls or know what kind of drainage a basement has in flooded conditions. That’s why the conversation around a national flood disclosure program continues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeownersneedtobeawareofflooddisclosures\">When Do Homeowners Need to Be Aware of Flood Disclosures?</h2>\n<p>You should be aware of local flood disclosures laws when you’re in the process of buying or selling a house in a flood zone. Before the closing, you’ll likely hire an inspector to perform a home inspection of the property.</p>\n<p>Flood disclosures are part of the purchase and sale process, but homeowners should be aware of their flood risk and flood zone even if they have no intention of selling their home soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resourcesforhomeownersinfloodzones\">Resources for Homeowners in Flood Zones</h2>\n<p>Every homeowner should know the answer to these two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is my house in a flood zone?</li>\n<li>Am I required to disclose flooding if I sell my home?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most homeowners who are in a flood zone know it – their home insurer likely requires them to carry flood insurance. This coverage may even be a condition of their mortgage.</p>\n<p>Disclosure awareness is particularly important in high-risk areas where state requirements are weak. If you take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/flood-disclosure-map\">NRDC flood disclosure map</a>, you'll notice two states along the Gulf Coast lack state requirements, although both states have created voluntary disclosure forms: Alabama and Florida.</p>\n<p>If you live in a flood-prone area, your city may even have its own resources to help homeowners (and realtors) navigate local requirements.</p>\n<p>Coastal Jacksonville's county website speaks specifically to <a href=\"https://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/en/residents/property-owners-and-renters/homeowners-and-neighborhoods/find-my-flood-zone#/\">local flood risks</a> that apply to all homeowners, not just those who are selling their home.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand your home’s flooding history, look up your local flood map. The easiest way to do this is to search online for “flood maps” or “flood insurance rate maps” followed by your city or town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Be aware of local flood disclosures laws when you’re in the process of buying or selling a house in a flood zone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatyouneedtoknowaboutfloodinsurancemaps\">What You Need to Know about Flood Insurance Maps</h2>\n<p>The new flood season is year-round, and the government-funded flood maps that inform homeowners and homeowners insurance providers are struggling to keep up with the changing climate.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General recently discovered that <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/joel-scata/femas-outdated-and-backward-looking-flood-maps\">58 percent</a> of FEMA’s flood maps are considered “inaccurate or out-of-date,\" and most are more than five years old.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for homeowners?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may need to ask around locally to find out if your home is in an area that flooded.</li>\n<li>Stay on top of FEMA flood map updates. <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">FEMA's website</a> also has a subscription option to help you stay current on changes to your flood zone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bottom line: you’ll need to be a little proactive to keep up with your flood risk these days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodinsuranceforall\">Flood Insurance for All</h2>\n<p>Flooding can be unpredictable and the effects can be devastating. Floods don’t just happen in areas outlined on the 100-year flood map.</p>\n<p>Look at Hurricane Harvey, where heavy rains brought intense flooding to thousands of homes, many of which were outside the designated high-risk flood zones.</p>\n<p>FEMA recently estimated that 13 million Americans live within a 100-year flood zone. These are areas with a one percent chance of flooding. This may not sound like much, but a new <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaac65/pdf\">study by Environmental Research Letters (ERL)</a> reported that FEMA's estimate was low.</p>\n<p>By the ERL’s count, <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/digest/41-million-americans-live-in-flood-zones-three-times-the-fema-estimate-finds-new-study\">41 million Americans</a> are living in a 100-year flood zone. That's more than triple FEMA’s estimate of Americans who are exposed to serious flooding. And this number is expected to grow.</p>\n<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that by 2100, the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/techrpt83_Global_and_Regional_SLR_Scenarios_for_the_US_final.pdf\">oceans could rise</a> by as much as 9.8 feet along the East Coast of the United States. And many areas are already experiencing increased coastal flooding.</p>\n<p>You can't stop the water from rising, so your best bet as a homeowner in a high- or low-risk flood zone is to maintain appropriate flood insurance coverage.</p>"

    body: "<p>Most homeowners don’t have flood insurance. Part of that problem is misconception: many homeowners don’t realize their home insurance policy excludes flood coverage. For others, they aren’t required by federally regulated lenders to carry it, so they don’t.</p>\n<p>But the reason most people don’t have <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>? They drastically underestimate their own risk of flooding – to their detriment.</p>\n<p>So let us be the first to address the question, “Do I need flood insurance?”</p>\n<p>Everyone needs flood insurance. And this is why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"astandardhomeinsurancepolicyisntenough\">A standard home insurance policy isn’t enough</h2>\n<p>A basic <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> can cover <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">some types of water damage</a>, but it doesn’t cover flood damage caused by storm surge. You have to add flood insurance to your coverage or purchase it as a separate policy. Unfortunately, many homeowners think homeowners insurance covers flood damage.</p>\n<p>And that misconception has consequences. According to a 2020 poll by the Insurance Information Institute, only <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2020_triple-i_consumer_poll_091620.pdf\">27% of American homeowners have flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>More disconcerting is that the coastal homeowners who arguably need flood protection the most also lack protection. In 2017, McKinsey &amp; Company found <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insuring-hurricanes-perspectives-gaps-and-opportunities-after-2017\">about 60%</a> of Florida homeowners don’t have flood insurance despite having front-row seats to the impact hurricanes can have when they make landfall.</p>\n<p>Please note, home policies, including <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>, do have <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. However, it covers wind damage, not damage caused by storm surge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodscanhappenanywhereyesanywhere\">Floods can happen anywhere – yes, anywhere</h2>\n<p>As the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) famously noted, “Anywhere it can rain, it can flood.” That’s because it’s not proximity to the coastline or bodies of water alone that determine whether your area can flood. Depending on how your city or county manages waterways (think: dams, levees, and reservoirs) and the changes made to the land, your region may be one that faces flooding from prolonged rain, storm surge, or sudden snowmelt. If infrastructure isn’t well-maintained, urban flooding can be a big risk.</p>\n<p>Florida in particular is more at risk for floods than any other state, in part because it has 11,000 miles of rivers, streams, and waterways. But its flat terrain and urbanization (pavements and other impenetrable surfaces that impede natural drainage systems) further increase its flood risk. Plus, it experiences an average of 53.7 inches of rainfall per year.</p>\n<p>Still not sure if flood insurance is for you? These facts about floods may change your mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One inch of water can cause <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/8.5x11_1_inch_flyer.pdf\">$25,000 or more</a> in damage to your home.</li>\n<li>More than <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-flood-insurance\">1.2 million single-family homes</a> risk flooding from storm surge in a category 1 hurricane; that number jumps to over 7.5 million in a category 5.</li>\n<li>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says <a href=\"https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/floods/\">flooding can happen within minutes</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"federalfloodmapsareinaccurate\">Federal flood maps are inaccurate</h2>\n<p>To be fair, FEMA has a lot on its plate. It has the nearly impossible task of keeping flood hazard maps up to date for more than 22,000 communities, and it is the first to admit <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-map-revision-processes\">what a challenge that is</a>. Though FEMA is supposed to update its maps every five years, nearly <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-maps/\">two-thirds of flood maps</a> haven’t been updated in that time. Some maps haven’t been updated in more than 40 years.</p>\n<p>Many homeowners only purchase flood insurance if they live in a high-risk flood zone or Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), have a federally-backed mortgage, and are therefore required to have flood insurance. But if homeowners rely solely on these mandates or federal maps to inform whether or not they have flood insurance, they may put themselves at serious risk.</p>\n<p>Take Hurricane Harvey for example. The hurricane damaged more than 204,000 Houston homes, most of which were outside the federally regulated 100-year floodplain. More than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/29/where-harvey-is-hitting-hardest-four-out-of-five-homeowners-lack-flood-insurance/\">80% of these homeowners</a> didn’t have flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisfloodinsurancerequiredagrowingneed\">When is flood insurance required: A growing need</h2>\n<p>As our planet gets warmer and sea levels rise, flooding will only get worse. In fact, climate change contributes to four key factors that increase flood risk:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Heavier precipitation.</strong> A warmer atmosphere holds more water, and that means heavier rains. Experts have seen an increase in global precipitation and precipitation in the contiguous 48 states by <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/precipitation_td.pdf\">+0.02 inches per year</a> from 1901 to 2020. This trend is expected to grow. As you might’ve guessed, heavier rainfall increases the likelihood of floods.</li>\n<li><strong>More snowmelt.</strong> Rising temperatures also lead to faster and earlier snowmelts, which can cause an uptick in spring flooding. Winter and spring soil is too frozen or wet to absorb the snow and rain runoff from rivers, which means higher flood risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequent hurricanes.</strong> Ida. Irma. Maria. Harvey. Florence. Michael. In just the past few years alone, we’ve witnessed the catastrophic might of hurricanes, and climate change will only increase their frequency. Climate scientists predict an <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/#:\">increase in the frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes</a> in the Atlantic Basin with 10 to 15 percent more precipitation. And stronger storms bring greater rains, stronger winds, and stronger storm surges.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher seas.</strong> Rising ocean temperatures, which melt glaciers and ice sheets, cause sea levels to rise around the world. Not to bring you down or anything, but our oceans have already risen <a href=\"https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/\">seven to eight inches</a> since 1900. NOAA predicts the global sea level will rise at least <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">12 inches by 2100</a> on a low-emissions pathway and 8.2 feet if nothing changes. Higher seas increase high-tide flooding, which has already doubled in the last 30 years, and increases opportunities for storm surges.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"floodingissuperexpensive\">Flooding is super expensive</h2>\n<p>To cover flood losses from 2007 to 2017, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) shelled out <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20210929/more-800-million-distributed-recovery-remains-focused-30-days-after#:\">$77 million</a> in claims from Hurricane Ida in 2021. While this is much less than was paid for events like Hurricanes Harvey or Katrina, it’s still a lot of losses for a smaller event.</p>\n<p>Let’s break that down even further. For individual homeowners, the national average flood claim payout was <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/data-visualization/historical-flood-risk-and-costs\">$52,000</a> in 2019, according to FEMA. For Florida homeowners specifically, the average flood claim payout was around <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/flood-insurance/\">$29,000</a>. And in late 2021, FEMA announced changes to its rating system that caused <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-insurance-rates/\">flood insurance rate increases</a> for many homeowners.</p>\n<p>Now imagine facing a $29,000 repair bill without insurance. For many families, that is an impossible sum of money. They would lose their home.</p>\n<p>That’s the real reason flood insurance is for everyone. No one should be left without the means to rebuild their lives after a disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in February 2020.

    body: "<p>Those who live in communities where flooding is considered a high-risk factor have a one-in-four chance of flooding over the course of a 30-year mortgage. It isn’t just the high-risk areas that need to be concerned with rising waters and potential storm floods; nearly <strong>25% of all flood claims</strong> are in low-to-moderate risk areas.</p>\n<p>As many have been forced to rebuild after major hurricanes such as Irma, Sandy, and Andrew, both communities and homeowners are looking for ways to protect themselves from <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">disastrous floods</a>. Take a look at these eight out-of-the-box ways cities, communities, and homeowners are exploring to better manage flood risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1seawalls\">1. Sea walls</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth107/node/1062\">sea wall</a> is an onshore structure designed to prevent water from flooding the coastline’s roads, promenades, houses, and other structures. Typically, sea walls are built parallel to the coastline and maintain a safe elevation from expected floodwaters during storms.</p>\n<p>A sea wall proposed for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/nyregion/sea-wall-nyc.html\">New York City’s coastline</a> involves man-made islands with retractable gates that attach to create a six-mile wall to guard against massive storm waters. Opponents say the solution is not enough – that a 20 to 30 foot wall wouldn’t solve the growing problems and could trap runoff and pollution within the wall. With a $119 billion price tag, it’s certainly not an immediate solution.</p>\n<p>While most sea walls are viewed as a community endeavor, coastal homeowners can look into building their own barrier on their property line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2fortifybeaches\">2. Fortify beaches</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/disappearing-beaches-modeling-shoreline-change-southern-california\">US Geological Survey</a> predicts that 31% to 67% of Southern California beaches will be completely eroded without proper intervention. Beaches are a natural barrier to coastal waters, giving leeway from the shoreline to streets, homes, and other structures. The diminishing shoreline makes it easier for waves to overtake communities.</p>\n<p>Even without a sea wall, there are ways to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Helen%20Robertson-%20The%20Preventive%20Methods%20of%20Beach%20Erosion.pdf\">fortify a beach</a> to manage floods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sand dunes: Rolling hills of sand that create elevated peaks with valleys where water can pool to protect structures inland of the dunes.</li>\n<li>Vegetation: Holds sand in place, keeping it from being pulled out into the ocean with waves or blown away by the wind.</li>\n<li>Sand fences: Forces windblown and drifting sand to accumulate in a desired location.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While major beach fortification is often a community endeavor, homeowners living on the coastline can plant vegetation or build a sand fence to help maintain the beach adjacent to their home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3pierandbeamfoundations\">3. Pier and beam foundations</h2>\n<p>Hoisting a home above anticipated floodwaters has been used for decades in places like Hawaii. Instead of using a standard concrete slab foundation, the pier and beam foundation model raises the house with a crawl space under it. Water can flow through the crawlspace rather than pool directly in the home.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Houston <a href=\"https://wga-llp.com/city-of-houston-adopts-new-floodplain-ordinance-chapter-19/\">approved new building regulations</a> requiring pier and beam foundations. The ruling came after a study found 80% of homes damaged during Harvey could have been prevented with pier and beam foundations.</p>\n<p>This construction has benefits beyond flood prevention. All electrical and plumbing components under the home are accessible through the crawlspace. When a pipe leaks under traditional cement slab foundation, it’s difficult (and costly) to reach the pipe. But with pier and beam foundations, pipes are easier to access, which can help mitigate thousands of dollars in damage and repairs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4floatinghomes\">4. Floating homes</h2>\n<p>US coastal communities are looking to European models of floating homes. In Finland, people are already <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/infrastructure/485887-can-floating-houses-provide-a-solution-to\">lining up to buy amphibious homes</a> – that is, homes produced at a manufacturing site, floated to the homeowner’s location, and anchored to the seabed with enough leeway to rise and fall with the ocean tides.</p>\n<p>While it’s a creative solution to address both housing shortages and flooding issues, there are some drawbacks that impact its widespread viability. For starters, floating homes cost 8% to 16% more than traditional land-built homes. Plus, there’s the potential for more risk – emergency response may struggle to reach a home, and children may be at greater risk for drowning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5breakawaywalls\">5. Breakaway walls</h2>\n<p>The real ordeal with floods is getting water out fast enough to reduce damage. When water can’t drain from the home quickly, it continues to rise and damage secondary floors. A <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fema_tb_9.pdf\">breakaway wall</a> could solve this problem for multi-level homes.</p>\n<p>The breakaway wall is a constructed wall that doesn’t support the structural needs of the home. As floodwaters hit the wall, it is designed to literally break away, preventing water from pooling on lower levels of the home. This protects the elevated levels of the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6floodflaps\">6. Flood flaps</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.getfloodflaps.com/\">flood flap</a> is a vent structure installed in crawlspaces. It enables proper ventilation and potential flood drainage while completely sealing the crawlspace to reduce the chance of rodent infestation. As pressure builds from water entering the crawlspace, the flap opens to allow it to drain out.</p>\n<p>When water drains from a crawlspace faster, it prevents the foundation from being saturated, which can cause substantial damage. It also helps keep crawlspace walls from breaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7residentialfloodbarriers\">7. Residential flood barriers</h2>\n<p>If you live in a flood zone, you probably already know that sandbags are used as residential flood barriers to protect a home from incoming floodwaters. There are a few techniques beyond the sandbag method that create residential flood barriers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Door barriers. These prevent water from seeping in under the door or through the door jam.</li>\n<li>Portable dams. These expand with water absorption or inflate to build a barrier for more water to enter (often stackable to build a wall).</li>\n<li>Water walls. This is a soft or hard structure several feet high that surrounds a structure and diverts water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood-risk area</a>, you may want to consider some of these approaches to keep your home protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8privatefloodinsurance\">8. Private flood insurance</h2>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t cover flooding, which is why <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is essential.</p>\n<p>The benefit of private flood insurance is that it provides more coverage and is often more affordable than National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) coverage.</p>\n<p>For example, our flood insurance is available as an endorsement to your home insurance policy. That means you just add it on – no need to buy a separate policy, pay multiple premiums, and manage multiple deductibles. Plus, your coverage is effective immediately, and your home and personal belongings are covered to your homeowners limits.</p>\n<p>That’s a stark contrast to the $250,000 limit from the NFIP for your dwelling and $100,000 limit on belongings.</p>\n<p>Whatever route you choose, just remember: even the best mitigation efforts won’t prevent all damage. That’s why flood risk management isn’t complete without flood insurance.</p>"

    body: "<p>Claims can be stressful, so no one would blame you for trying to find someone else to deal with yours. But while an assignment of benefits (AOB) contract might seem like your ticket to a hassle-free claim process, signing one means you’ve given someone else the right to deal with your insurance company and negotiate your benefits. Unfortunately, that person - usually a contractor or adjuster - may not have your best interests at heart.</p>\n<p>Worse? The problems that come with <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignment of benefits</a> in Florida like rampant fraud and excessive litigation play a major role in the state’s rising <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> premiums. Let’s dig into these numbers to see just how big an issue AOBs are in Florida and what homeowners can do to protect themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"76ofalllawsuitsfiledagainstinsurersareinflorida\">76% of All Lawsuits Filed Against Insurers Are in Florida</h2>\n<p>According to the most recent data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Florida is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/04/14/609721.htm\">76 percent of lawsuits</a> filed against insurance companies in the United States.</p>\n<p>On its own, that’s a staggering statistic. But when you add in that the Sunshine State accounts for just 8 percent of homeowners claims nationwide, you get an idea of just how big a problem assignment of benefits in Florida may be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d15billionpaidoutinclaims\">$15 Billion Paid Out in Claims</h2>\n<p>The idea that insurance companies have paid <a href=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/12/28/florida-personal-lines-coverage-reaches-crisis-levels-part-1/?slreturn=20220102123018\">$15 billion in claims</a> to Floridians since 2013 may be less shocking now that you know how often insurers are sued. However, only a small percentage of that money makes it to the actual homeowners with damaged roofs and flooded basements. Property Casualty 360 broke down how much everyone gets from these payouts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attorney’s fees:</strong> 71 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Insurers’ defense costs:</strong> 21 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Property owners:</strong> 8 percent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s just $1.2 billion of the total claim payout going to the individuals who suffered losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"33ofnewlitigationstemsfromassignmentofbenefitscases\">33% of New Litigation Stems from Assignment of Benefits Cases</h2>\n<p>Another sign that assignment of benefits is a problem for Florida homeowners? The number of overall new litigation dropped for insurance companies in 2021, but the percentage of new AOB cases increased, reaching <a href=\"https://www.artemis.bm/news/assignment-of-benefit-aob-claims-rising-for-florida-pc-insurers/\">33 percent in December</a>. That stat is specific to the month of December, but it represents both the highest percentage of a distinct upward trend that began in the first six months of 2021.</p>\n<p>A healthy majority of new assignment of benefit cases were in just five Florida counties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Miami-Dade County</strong>: 24 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Broward County</strong>: 16 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Palm Beach County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Orange County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Hillsborough County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount of new litigation over assignment of benefits in Florida continues to rise despite the state legislature passing a bill to limit AOB abuse through several provisions, including prohibiting certain fees and alterations to policy provisions and transferring particular pre-lawsuit duties to the assignee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancecostsandassignmentofbenefitsinflorida\">Home Insurance Costs and Assignment of Benefits in Florida</h2>\n<p>The premiums your insurance company collects go towards its expenses, including claims and legal fees if it's sued. When those costs get out of control, your insurer often has to raise premiums to cover them. That’s one reason insurance fraud is such a big deal. Claims paid to con artists make home insurance more expensive for everyone.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, assignment of benefits in Florida appears to be rife with fraudulent claims. Some of these claims were from unethical contractors who charged for unnecessary repairs. But Florida’s one-way attorney fee statute, designed to protect homeowners from exorbitant legal fees, encouraged lawyers to take on unwinnable cases and send the bill to the insurance company.</p>\n<p>All in all, the cost of insuring homes in Florida became too great for many insurance companies. And where there are fewer companies competing for business, insurance rates can skyrocket ﹘ as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.wptv.com/money/real-estate-news/heres-why-home-insurance-costs-continue-to-rise-in-florida\">25 percent increase</a> in Florida this year alone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beonthelookoutforassignmentofbenefitscams\">Be on the Lookout for Assignment of Benefit Scams</h2>\n<p>The tricky part about AOB scams is that the swindlers claim to have specialized knowledge and then offer to solve what seems like an overwhelming problem for essentially nothing. Who wouldn’t want that? However, that is also a red flag that something is amiss. Other <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">signs of assignment of benefits scams</a> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms that look unprofessional.</li>\n<li>Claims that your damage is worse than it is.</li>\n<li>Incentives to sign an AOB, such as rebates and gift cards.</li>\n<li>Someone who is pushy about getting your benefits assigned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that you don’t need to assign away your benefits to get your claim processed. You can manage the claim yourself to ensure that you get what you are entitled to.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you’ve ever bought or considered buying residential property in Florida, you’ve probably heard of the state’s homestead exemption, and with good reason. The Florida homestead exemption is a powerful tool that reduces the tax burden on the state’s homeowners. But what is the homestead exemption in Florida and how does it work?</p>\n<p>Here’s your guide to using this exemption to maximize the value of Florida homeownership and minimize your tax burden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthehomesteadexemptioninflorida\">What is the homestead exemption in Florida?</h2>\n<p>The Florida homestead exemption is a property tax break that’s offered based on your home’s assessed value and provides exemptions within a certain value limit. With it, you can reduce the taxable value of your home by as much as $50,000 if you owned your property on January 1 of the tax year.</p>\n<p>But what is the homestead exemption in Florida’s purpose? The homestead exemption in Florida addresses one of the reasons the cost of homeownership in Florida is so high: property taxes. The amount you pay can differ according to the city or even the county, but the average Florida homeowner pays <a href=\"https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/states/florida-property-tax/\">$1,752 every year</a>. If you already own a home in Florida or are looking to buy real estate, the Florida homestead exemption can help you reduce that burden.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore how the homestead exemption works, how to submit your documentation, and how much you can save on your homestead property taxation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesthehomesteadexemptionwork\">How does the homestead exemption work?</h2>\n<p>If this is the first time you are applying for the homestead exemption, you may be confused by how it works. It’s a tiered system based on the value of your home. For instance, the exemptions could look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $25,000 in value is exempted for the first $50,000 in assessed value of your home.</li>\n<li>The above exemption applies to all property taxes, including those related to your school district.</li>\n<li>You pay full taxes on any value between $25,000 and $50,000.</li>\n<li>For any assessed value between $50,000 and $75,000, an additional $25,000 is eligible for exemption. This exemption does not apply to school district taxes.</li>\n<li>Properties valued at over $75,000 are exempt at the previous levels, and then fully taxed for the portion over $75,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps some examples can better understand how the homestead exemption works (see Figure 1):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$48,000 home:</strong> For this home, the first $25,000 in assessed value would be exempt from all property taxes. The remaining $23,000 is assessed value and is taxed normally.</li>\n<li><strong>$70,000 home:</strong> For this home, the first $25,000 in assessed value would be exempt from all property taxes. The next $25,000 would be taxed normally. The remaining $20,000 in value would be exempt from all property taxes except school district taxes.</li>\n<li><strong>$90,000 home:</strong> For this home, the first $25,000 would be fully exempt from taxes, the next $25,000 would be fully taxed, the following $25,000 would be exempt from all but school district taxes, and the final $15,000 would be fully taxed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Taxable%20Portion%20of%20a%20Homes%20Value%20with%20FL%20Homestead%20Exemption.svg\" alt=\"img src=“home value graph.svg&quot; alt=“the taxable portion of a home's value for Florida homestead exemption explained in a chart&quot;\" title=\"Florida Homestead Exemption\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoyouqualifyforahomesteadexemptioninflorida\">How do you qualify for a homestead exemption in Florida?</h2>\n<p>While the tax savings from an exemption could be significant, not everyone is eligible. The Florida homestead exemption rules include the following requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are the property owner.</li>\n<li>The property you want to claim the exemption for must be your permanent residence.</li>\n<li>The property you want to claim should be the permanent residence of someone you can claim as a dependent on your taxes.</li>\n<li>You must have lived at the property on January 1 of the tax year in question. (e.g., If you hope to claim the homestead exemption on your 2022 taxes, you must have lived at the property in question on January 1, 2022.)</li>\n<li>The property you want to claim the exemption for may not have been rented for more than 30 days in a given calendar year. (Renting the property for more than 30 days for two consecutive years or for more than six months is considered an abandonment of the Florida homestead exemption.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re uncertain whether you meet these criteria, get in touch with your tax preparer or CPA. They can help you understand the details of Florida’s tax code to determine whether you legally qualify for the homestead exemption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoyousavewithahomesteadexemptioninflorida\">How much do you save with a homestead exemption in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Calculating the Florida homestead exemption starts with three distinct valuations for your property. These are its:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Just value.</strong> This is your property’s market value.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessed value.</strong> Your property’s assessed value is the just value without the assessment limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Taxable value.</strong> The taxable value of your property is its assessed value minus exemptions. This is the value the tax collector uses to calculate the taxes due.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every home is different, but a homestead exemption in Florida can exempt up to $50,000 of your home’s assessed value from tax liability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentofileforahomesteadexemptioninflorida\">When to file for a homestead exemption in Florida</h2>\n<p>The next two questions are: What is the homestead exemption in Florida’s filing process and when should you start?</p>\n<p>To get a homestead deduction on your Florida taxes, you have to fill out an application form, the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dr501.pdf\">DR-501</a>, and demonstrate proof of residence by March 1 of the year for which you wish to qualify. For example, if you want to qualify for a Florida homestead exemption on your 2022 taxes, you must have filed this paperwork by March 1, 2022. Late filings are permitted, but you will need to explain the extenuating circumstances that caused you to miss the March deadline.</p>\n<p>You have three options for completing and submitting it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the form online and select the state’s e-file option.</li>\n<li>Print the form, fill it out, and mail it to the property appraiser office of the county where the property lies.</li>\n<li>Visit your county’s property appraiser office and complete the form there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whether you complete the form online or in person, you’ll be asked to provide proof of your residence at the address you want to claim the exemption for. You should confirm what is acceptable with the county property appraiser’s office, but a few examples of documents that might need include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Florida driver’s license or state ID</li>\n<li>A Florida vehicle registration number</li>\n<li>A Florida voter’s ID</li>\n<li>Immigration documents, if you’re not a U.S. citizen</li>\n<li>Proof of previous residency in a place other than Florida, plus proof that that residency has ended</li>\n<li>Evidence that you’ve given up a driver’s license from another state</li>\n<li>Declaration of domicile and residency in Florida</li>\n<li>The name of your current employer</li>\n<li>School addresses of any dependent children you have</li>\n<li>A bank statement, plus a mailing address for a checking account</li>\n<li>Proof of payment of utilities at the homestead address</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"doesmyfloridahomesteadexemptionexpire\">Does my Florida homestead exemption expire?</h2>\n<p>One nice feature of the Florida homestead exemption is that you don’t have to reapply every year. Unless you take action to cancel your exemption, your homestead will be automatically renewed by the state. Sometime after January first in each year, after you’re first approved for the homestead exemption, the state will mail you an exemption renewal.</p>\n<p>The flip side of this is that it’s your responsibility to contact the state if and when you’re no longer eligible for the exemption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are no longer eligible if one of the following is true:</li>\n<li>The home is no longer your primary residence or the residence of someone you can claim as a dependent.</li>\n<li>You rent the property for more than 30 days per year.</li>\n<li>The home has changed ownership, either because of a sale, <a href=\"/blog/divorcing-with-a-mortgage/\">divorce</a>, marriage, death, or another event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s important to contact the state's Department of Revenue if and when you become ineligible to claim the Florida homestead exemption. If you don’t update your status, you could be subject to a tax lien that comes with both interest and penalties.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canikeepmyflhomesteadexemptionifimove\">Can I keep my FL homestead exemption if I move?</h2>\n<p>You are not allowed to transfer your Florida homestead exemption when you move from one Florida homestead to another Florida homestead. However, Florida law allows for “portability” which means that you can transfer some or all of the assessment difference. This lowers the assessed value of the homestead. In order to use the Save Our Homes (SOH) assessment limitation, you must complete <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dr501t.pdf\">Form DR-501T</a> along with the homestead exemption application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canyougetafloridahomesteadexemptiononamobilehome\">Can you get a Florida homestead exemption on a mobile home?</h2>\n<p>Some <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-mobile-home/\">mobile homes</a> can qualify for a homestead exemption. If you own a mobile home and the land it sits on, then you must permanently affix the mobile home to the land to qualify for the exemption. You must pay a $3 fee to the property appraiser to receive a Real Property (RP) decal to mark your mobile home as real property. Mobile homes on leased or rented land do not qualify.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherpropertytaxexemptionsinflorida\">Other property tax exemptions in Florida</h2>\n<p>The Florida homestead exemption is a powerful way to reduce your property taxes – but it’s not the only <a href=\"/blog/florida-property-tax-exemptions/\">tax exemption available to Florida homeowners</a>. Depending on your circumstances, you may also qualify for one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Construction for an older family member:</strong> Added a mother-in-law apartment to your home? You can apply to have that construction reduce the value of your total property. Complete the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dr501pgp.pdf\">Original Application for Assessment Reduction for Living Quarters of Parents or Grandparents</a> form. Note: you’ll have to re-apply for this exemption every year.</li>\n<li><strong>Longtime limited-income senior exemption:</strong> This one’s a county-by-county exemption and is available only to those who are 65 or older, have lived in Florida for at least 25 years, and have income below a certain threshold.

    body: "<p>When you lease out your Florida home, condo, or mobile home, you <a href=\"/blog/how-to-become-a-landlord/\">become a landlord</a> – and that means you have obligations to your tenants that are enforced by Florida law.</p>\n<p>In fact, you don’t even need a written lease to be subject to Florida’s rental laws. Under these laws, both tenants and landlords have rights and responsibilities. Landlords can be fined or penalized if they don’t comply, and tenants can face evictions for violations.</p>\n<p>Florida landlord-tenant law is outlined in the Florida Statutes, Part II, Chapter 83 – part of the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act. Here’s what you should know about it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"therulesofthelease\">The Rules of the Lease</h2>\n<p>A lease is an agreement between you, the landlord, and your tenant. Leases are usually written (and should be!), but oral lease agreements can also be legally binding, according to the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act.</p>\n<p>Essentially, a lease dictates the terms and conditions promised by both parties. Written leases may have specific terms and conditions, but they can’t be unreasonable compared to the rules established in the act. The Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act prevails over lease terms and conditions when clauses are called into question.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tenantrightsaccordingtofloridarentallaws\">Tenant Rights According to Florida Rental Laws</h2>\n<p>At the very core, the Florida landlord tenant law is meant to ensure that landlords provide a private, safe, and secure place for tenants to live in exchange for rent. This means that the dwelling needs to have proper door locks and latches and be free from building code safety violations.</p>\n<p>Under this law, Florida tenants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a right to a private, peaceful dwelling.</li>\n<li>Can use the property in a lawful way once the lease is signed and rent is paid.</li>\n<li>Must be notified in writing of a lease violation and given adequate time to remedy the problem.</li>\n<li>May withhold rent if the residence has become untenantable because a landlord has failed to meet their obligations so long as the tenant gives seven days’ written notice.</li>\n<li>Have the right to move out with proper written notice, which may be up to 60 days before the end of the lease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a tenant takes a landlord to court, the losing party may be responsible for the legal fees of the winning party. Landlords are not obligated to provide <a href=\"/faq/does-home-insurance-cover-tenants/\">insurance for tenants</a>, but it’s a good idea to have a <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance policy</a> that protects your investment and your liability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landlordresponsibilitiesaccordingtothefloridalandlordtenantlaw\">Landlord Responsibilities According to the Florida Landlord Tenant Law</h2>\n<p>Landlords have certain responsibilities to ensure that the tenants’ rights are respected. Those responsibilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide at least 12 hours of notice before entering the property to make agreed upon repairs; notice can be shortened or waived in emergency situations.</li>\n<li>To provide a dwelling that has working plumbing, hot water, and heating.</li>\n<li>To ensure the dwelling is structurally sound with working (and locking) doors and windows.</li>\n<li>To ensure the property is free of pests.</li>\n<li>To provide written notice of lease violations with adequate time to fix the problem if it is curable.</li>\n<li>To preserve the security deposit and return it within 15 days after the tenant leaves or provide written notice within 30 days if the deposit won’t be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Landlords in Florida are not responsible for upkeep on mobile homes or other structures owned by the tenant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"terminatingaleaseinflorida\">Terminating a Lease in Florida</h2>\n<p>Landlords and tenants may terminate a lease in Florida, but only in certain circumstances and with notice. If a rental agreement does state the duration of the lease, then the duration is set by how often the rent is paid (i.e., if rent is due every week, then the tenancy is week to week). This also determines how much notice either party must give before terminating the lease. Rental laws in Florida law require:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 days for a week-to-week lease.</li>\n<li>15 days for a month-to-month lease.</li>\n<li>30 days for a quarter-to-quarter lease.</li>\n<li>60 days for a year-to-year lease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terminating lease with a set duration (e.g., one year) also requires notice. In that case, the landlord can include a notification provision that spells out how much notice the tenant must give if it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires the landlord to give the tenant notice if the lease won’t be renewed.</li>\n<li>Does not require either party to give more than 60 days’ notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Landlords can also include a provision where the tenant owes a predetermined amount of money for failing to give the required notice before vacating the residence. To do this, the landlord must alert the tenant within 15 days before the start of the notification period, explaining in writing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tenant’s obligations under the notification provision.</li>\n<li>The date the rental agreement is terminated.</li>\n<li>All the fees, charges, and penalties the tenant is responsible for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whendoesafloridatenanthavetherighttoterminatealease\">When Does a Florida Tenant Have the Right to Terminate a Lease?</h3>\n<p>Tenants can get out of a fixed-term rental agreement before its end date in a few situations. Most of these are caused by the landlord failing to meet their obligations under Florida landlord tenant law. For example, a tenant may have the right to terminate their lease if the landlord harasses them or creates an unsafe situation by violating health or safety codes. In these situations, the tenant can break the lease seven days after giving their landlord written notice.</p>\n<p>According to rental laws in Florida, members of the military can also break their leases in several situations, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving change of station orders that move them 35 miles or more away from the rental premises.</li>\n<li>Being prematurely or involuntarily discharged from duty.</li>\n<li>Being released from active duty or state active duty.</li>\n<li>Receiving orders that require them to move into government quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Service members in these and similar situations must give a written notice to their landlords with an effective date that is at least 30 days past the date the landlord receives it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whencanafloridalandlordterminatealease\">When Can a Florida Landlord Terminate a Lease?</h3>\n<p>Florida landlords can also terminate a lease if a tenant fails to meet their obligations, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping the portion of the residence they occupy clean.</li>\n<li>Using all electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, sanitary, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances in a reasonable manner.</li>\n<li>Refraining from removing, damaging, destroying, defacing, or impairing any part of the property without permission.</li>\n<li>Paying rent when it is due.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How a landlord goes about terminating a lease depends on the type of violation. Florida landlord tenant law identifies two kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Curable lease violations:</strong> These are violations a tenant should be allowed to fix, such as failing to keep the yard clean or having a pet when the lease forbids it. The landlord needs to notify the tenant of their violations in writing and give them seven days to rectify the situation. If the tenant doesn’t fix the violation, then the landlord may terminate the lease.</li>\n<li><strong>Incurable lease violations:</strong> These are violations that tenants shouldn’t be allowed to fix, either because they are serious in nature or they have happened several times within 12 months of a written warning. Illegal activity, continual excessive noise complaints, and intentionally damaging property are all examples of incurable violations that allow landlords to serve a seven-day notice of eviction. An example of an incurable lease violation might be a tenant conducting illegal activity on the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Failure to pay rent is another situation. Rental laws in Florida do not provide a grace period for rent so landlords can send a <a href=\"https://www.stessa.com/blog/late-rent-notice/\">late rent notice</a> as soon as a tenant fails to pay. Once three days have passed, excluding weekends and legal holidays, they can terminate the lease.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theevictionprocessunderfloridalandlordtenantlaw\">The Eviction Process Under Florida Landlord Tenant Law</h2>\n<p>At some point, you may need to evict a tenant (though the right screening process may help prevent that. <a href=\"/blog/first-time-landlord-tips/\">Check out these 15 landlord tips</a> for more pointers!). Terminating the lease, with all of its notification requirements, is just the first step in the eviction process.</p>\n<p>The next step is to file a complaint with the court, which involves a filing fee plus an extra fee for each summons that will be issued﹘one for every tenant. After filing, you’ll be given a court date, and the tenant will be served. This gives the tenant an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p>If the tenant decides not to contest the eviction or the judge rules against them, then the judge grants a court order with the day and time of eviction. This order goes to the sheriff who takes it to the tenant. The tenant has 24 hours to pack their stuff and go before the sheriff returns to padlock the door.</p>\n<p>If the tenant fights the eviction successfully, then they get to stay in the rental property for the remainder of the lease.</p>\n<p>Landlords must follow the Florida eviction process to regain control of their property. They can't shut off utilities, take down doors, or prevent access until the eviction is complete. Additionally, landlords can’t evict tenants who report legitimate complaints about the safety and security of the property or who have exercised their rights under fair housing laws. Retaliatory conduct on the part of the landlord can be used as a defense in the eviction process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"informationtoincludeinanevictionnotice\">Information to Include in an Eviction Notice</h3>\n<p>Florida has three types of termination for cause notices that start the eviction process. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three-day notice to pay rent or quit:</strong> A tenant may receive this notice even if they’re only a day late with the rent. This notice should include the amount owed, the rental property’s address, and date when rent must be paid before eviction proceedings.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven-day notice to cure:</strong> This notice is used when a tenant commits a curable lease violation. It should list the violation, explain they have seven days to remedy it or face eviction, and note that a second violation may result in lease termination without further warning.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven-day unconditional notice to quit:</strong> When a tenant commits an incurable violation, they get this notice to tell them their lease has been immediately terminated and that they have seven days to vacate the premises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Florida landlord tenant law, all of these must be in writing and either mailed or delivered to the tenant. Landlords may leave a copy at the premises if the tenant is absent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landlordsknowtherules\">Landlords: Know the Rules</h2>\n<p>Adhering to the Florida landlord tenant law is not only legally necessary – it also helps protect your property and your reputation. Another way to protect your property is to make sure you have the right property insurance. Get a quote for <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> today!</p>"

    body: "<p>We wrote recently about how the <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida homestead exemption</a> can help homeowners save money on their taxes by reducing the taxable portion of their homes’ value. There are other ways to save on your taxes as well.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ll highlight eight types of property tax exemptions and deductions available in <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that this post is meant to be purely informational and is not intended as advice. If you’re interested in personalized advice about your situation, be sure to consult with a tax advisor.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"1mortgageinsurancepremiumpropertytaxexemption\">1. Mortgage Insurance Premium Property Tax Exemption</h2>\n<p>The mortgage insurance premium property tax exemption is a federal exemption that was eliminated for tax year 2018 but is available once again in 2019 (and will be in 2020 as well). It lets homeowners deduct <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a> payments they made during the tax year.</p>\n<p>If you paid mortgage insurance during 2018, you may also be able to <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/is-pmi-tax-deductible/\">amend your 2018 taxes</a> to claim the deduction this year.</p>\n<p>Note that there are income limits for who can claim this property tax exemption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you earn more than $100,000 (as a married couple filing jointly) or more than $50,000 (as an individual filer), the <strong>amount of mortgage insurance you can deduct is limited</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you earn more than $109,000 (married filing jointly) or more than $54,000 (individual), you are <strong>likely ineligible for this deduction</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2mortgageinterestpropertytaxdeductions\">2. Mortgage Interest Property Tax Deductions</h2>\n<p>Another property tax exemption available in Florida (and the rest of the country) is the one you can get by deducting the amount you pay in mortgage interest from your overall taxable income.</p>\n<p>Like the mortgage insurance deduction, this one comes with limits. It’s available for interest paid on mortgages for primary residences or second homes, on mortgage loan values up to…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$750,000 for a home bought after December 15, 2017 for married people filing jointly.</li>\n<li>$375,000 for a home bought after December 15, 2017 for those filing as individuals.</li>\n<li>$1 million for a home bought before December 15, 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The deduction is also restricted to certain types of mortgage loans. You may be eligible only if your loan is…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A first or second mortgage.</li>\n<li>A home improvement loan.</li>\n<li>A home equity loan.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinanced loan</a>.</li>\n<li>A loan used to buy, build, or substantially improve your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s an additional property tax exemption available to Florida homeowners who received a <a href=\"https://floridahousing.org/lenders-loan-officers/florida-housing-mortgage-credi\">mortgage credit certificate</a> (MCC) to buy their homes. These homeowners may be able to deduct between 10 and 50 percent of their mortgage interest from their federal return as a dollar-for-dollar deduction, up to $2,000.</p>\n<p>This can be a powerful way to reduce your total taxes owed. Note that this is a “nonrefundable” deduction, meaning that the lowest it can take your taxes is $0; you cannot be eligible for a refund based on this deduction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3propertytaxexemptionsforrealestatecosts\">3. Property Tax Exemptions for Real Estate Costs</h2>\n<p>In Florida, state and local real estate taxes are typically deductible from your federal tax returns, including taxes you paid at closing if you bought your home during the tax year in question. Other closing costs may also be deductible, including settlement fees (aka points) and prepaid mortgage interest.</p>\n<p>Note that the total amount you can deduct for state and local real estate costs is $10,000 for married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for those filing singly or separately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4propertytaxexemptionsformilitarymembersinflorida\">4. Property Tax Exemptions for Military Members in Florida</h2>\n<p>Military members and families in Florida have access to several potential property tax exemptions, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortgage interest deduction</strong>: This is available to military members even if you receive a <a href=\"https://www.allfloridatax.net/blog/tax-benefits-for-military-personnel/37523\">non-taxable military housing allowance</a>. In fact, you can deduct your mortgage interest without reducing your nontaxable allowance.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment exemptions</strong>: If you were deployed during the tax year, you may qualify for <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0100-0199/0196/Sections/0196.173.html\">additions to the Florida homestead exemption</a>, depending on how many days you were deployed.</li>\n<li><strong>Surviving spouse exemption</strong>: If you are the surviving spouse of someone who died from causes linked to their military service, you may be eligible for additional homestead exemptions. You may also be eligible for exemptions if you’re the surviving spouse of a first responder who was killed in their line of work. (Details outlined in the “<a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=196.081&URL=0100-0199/0196/Sections/0196.081.html\">Fallen Heroes Act</a>.”)</li>\n<li><strong>Disabled veteran exemption</strong>: If you’re a military <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=196.081&URL=0100-0199/0196/Sections/0196.081.html\">veteran with injuries</a> fully or partly caused by combat and you’re 65 or older, you may qualify for additional property tax exemptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5propertytaxexemptionsavailableforhealthrelatedhomeimprovements\">5. Property Tax Exemptions Available for Health-Related Home Improvements</h2>\n<p>If you <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0100-0199/0193/Sections/0193.703.html\">upgraded your home for medical purposes</a> (e.g., modified cabinets, added grab bars in the shower, added ramps, etc.), the cost of those upgrades that exceeds 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income may be deducted.</p>\n<p>This deduction is somewhat complex, though: if the updates added to your home’s value, you’re only allowed to deduct the difference between the expense and your home’s increased value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6propertytaxexemptionsavailableinfloridaforpeoplewithdisabilities\">6. Property Tax Exemptions Available in Florida for People with Disabilities</h2>\n<p>If you have disabilities, you may qualify for a $500 property tax deduction. <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0100-0199/0196/Sections/0196.101.html\">State law specifically mentions</a> blindness, use of a wheelchair for mobility, and other partial and total disabilities as qualifying conditions for this exemption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7propertytaxexemptionsavailabletolimitedincomeseniorsinflorida\">7. Property Tax Exemptions Available to Limited-Income Seniors in Florida</h2>\n<p>If you’re 65 or older who you’ve lived in Florida for at least 25 years, you may be eligible for <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0100-0199/0196/Sections/0196.075.html\">up to 100 percent property tax exemptions</a>. There are some limits to this exemption, though, including…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must live in certain areas of the sate.</li>\n<li>You must have income that falls within certain limits.</li>\n<li>Your home’s value cannot exceed $250,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even those who don’t qualify for the full 100 percent exemption may qualify for partial exemptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8propertytaxexemptionconsiderationsforfirsttimefloridahomebuyers\">8. Property Tax Exemption Considerations for First-Time Florida Homebuyers</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/pt107.pdf\">first-time homebuyers</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate values are appraised in January of each year, and proposed tax notices are sent in August. Taxes themselves are due the following March.</li>\n<li>Once a homeowner claims the Florida homestead exemption, the Save Our Homes Benefit takes effect. This benefit prevents a home’s appraised value from increasing by more than three percent per year.</li>\n<li>When a home is sold, previous exemptions are removed, including any Save Our Homes Benefit attached to a previous homestead exemption.</li>\n<li>While the new owner of the home may reapply for the homestead exemption, the property’s value will be reappraised when they do so; it may be valued at more than the three-percent-per-year cap it was allowed to be valued at prior to the sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the home, the neighborhood, and the length of time the last owners lived there, this could mean a significant difference in property tax bills from one owner to the next. It’s an <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">important consideration for those buying a home</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherwaystoreduceyourpropertytaxburdeninflorida\">Other Ways to Reduce Your Property Tax Burden in Florida</h2>\n<p>Besides applying for exemptions and taking tax deductions, there are two other ways to reduce the amount you pay in property taxes if you live in Florida. The first is to prepay your property taxes.</p>\n<p>While property taxes are officially due in March, the state offers the following <a href=\"https://www.sarasotataxcollector.com/services/tax-services/property-tax\">discounts for early payment</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Four percent for November payment</li>\n<li>Three percent for December payment</li>\n<li>Two percent for January payment</li>\n<li>One percent for February payment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re paying property taxes via an escrow account through a mortgage company, they will likely get paid in November, as the state requires November payments from mortgage companies.</p>\n<p>The second non-exemption way to reduce your tax burden is to appeal your home’s appraised taxable value. As mentioned above, the state appraises home values in January of each year. If, when you receive that assessment in August, you think the appraised value is incorrect, you can contest the valuation by following <a href=\"https://floridarevenue.com/property/Pages/Taxpayers_PropertyValueDisagree.aspx\">these guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>If you win your appeal and the taxable value of your home is decreased, you will likely be responsible for paying less in property taxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnmoreaboutfloridaspotentialpropertytaxexemptionsfromataxadvisor\">Learn More About Florida’s Potential Property Tax Exemptions from a Tax Advisor</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of this article, it’s always smart to talk with a tax advisor or CPA if you’re interested in learning which property tax exemptions available in Florida apply to your situation. Tax law is complicated and may change from year to year as the federal and state governments update laws.</p>"

It’s hurricane season – a time when your Florida home especially needs protection.</p>\n<p>The fix: <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">apply online</a> or give Kin a call at <a href=\"tel:866-204-2206\">866-204-2206</a>, and we’ll get your new policy squared away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Florida-Specialty.png?width=940&name=Florida-Specialty.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"itshurricaneseasonsomaketheswitchsoon\">It’s Hurricane Season, So Make the Switch Soon</h2>\n<p>All FSIC policies will be cancelled as of <strong>November 1, 2019 at 12:01 a.m.</strong>, and any unused premium will be refunded once the policy is cancelled.</p>\n<p>You have until this date to buy different <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>But it’s important to plan ahead during <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a>. If a storm approaches the Florida coast, many insurers (including Kin) may put moratoriums in place. These moratoriums mean insurers can’t bind your coverage until the storm passes, and that could cause unexpected delays – or lapses if you've waited too long.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehighcostofalapsedhomeinsurancepolicy\">The High Cost of a Lapsed Home Insurance Policy</h2>\n<p>Don’t wait until after the FSIC cancellation date to get a new policy, either. If your insurance lapses and a hurricane hits, you won’t have financial resources to help pay for the damages.</p>\n<p>Think it won't happen to you? In 2018, 2.8 million Florida homes were at risk for storm surge damage from hurricanes.

    body: "<p>Are you ready for the Fourth of July? Independence Day is right around the corner, and that means it’s time for backyard barbeques and amazing fireworks shows!</p>\n<p>While you’re planning to celebrate the birth of our country, keep in mind that more people usually means more things can go wrong. But don’t worry﹘we’ve got your back. Take a look at our Fourth of July safety tips for your home to keep you and your loved ones safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fireworkssafety\">Fireworks Safety</h2>\n<p>The safest way to enjoy fireworks is to go to a local show run by your local government or another organization. If that’s your preference, then keep a distance of at least 500 feet from the show’s detonation center. Chances are organizers have already set a boundary to keep people safe.</p>\n<p>For those who prefer setting off fireworks at home, your first step should be to check state law. Massachusetts is the only state that bans consumer fireworks entirely, but the rest all have <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/article/states-where-fireworks-are-legal/\">regulations prohibiting various pyrotechnics</a> for individuals.</p>\n<p>If you are lighting your own legal fireworks, then follow these safety tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep fireworks out of the hands of children.</li>\n<li>Always point fireworks away from people or animals.</li>\n<li>Keep a bucket of water, garden hose, or fire extinguisher on hand.</li>\n<li>Use eye protection if you are lighting fireworks.</li>\n<li>Never try to relight duds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accidents can happen even when you try to be safe. Luckily, homeowners insurance <a href=\"/blog/firework-damage-homeowners-insurance/\">covers fireworks damage</a> in some situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"petsafety\">Pet Safety</h2>\n<p>You might love firework displays, but your furry friends may feel quite the opposite. In general, <a href=\"/blog/pets-and-fireworks/\">pets and fireworks don’t mix</a>. The loud, sudden booms can hurt their ears or scare them, sometimes even to the point where they run away and get lost. For that reason alone, we recommend you don’t take pets to fireworks shows﹘including the backyard kind.</p>\n<p>Your better option is to leave your pets at home in a safe, secure space, like their crate or an escape-proof room with some of their favorite chew toys. You may even want to sit and comfort them while the bulk of the fireworks goes off. If your pet is in your backyard, keep an eye on them and make sure there are no ways for them to escape.</p>\n<p>Other Fourth of July safety tips for pets include keeping them away from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hot grills.</li>\n<li>Pointy barbeque skewers.</li>\n<li>Charcoal.</li>\n<li>Table scraps. (Some <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/7-foods-avoid-feeding-your-dog-or-cat\">foods are toxic to pets</a>.)</li>\n<li>Sparklers.</li>\n<li>Glow sticks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we’re at it, remember to watch your pets for sun and heat exposure. Give them plenty of access to shade and cool water when they are outside. And never leave your pet in your car because they can quickly overheat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watersafety\">Water Safety</h2>\n<p>Nothing beats spending a hot July 4th in the water, but time in a pool, lake, ocean requires you to take some basic safety measures. For example, you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Learn swimming and water survival skills.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pay attention to the weather and get out of the water if you see the signs of a thunderstorm.</p></li>\n<li><p>Listen to the lifeguard around, if there is one, and read any safety postings.</p></li>\n<li><p>Supervise children and pets at all times.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets if you’re on a boat..</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure every swimmer has a buddy so no one swims alone.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember to drink water if it’s especially hot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Avoid drinking alcohol while swimming or boating.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, too, that pools are considered <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a> that can easily draw the attention of minors who may not have the best judgment. Make sure you limit their ability to access your swimming pool with a fence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"picnicsafety\">Picnic Safety</h2>\n<p>What’s the Fourth of July without picnics in the park and backyard barbeques? But it’s important to remember that hot temperatures means some certain foods will spoil quickly if left out. To avoid foodborne illnesses, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wash your hands before you handle or prepare food.</li>\n<li>Keep perishable foods in a cooler with a lot of ice.</li>\n<li>Fill the cooler up. (A full cooler stays cold longer.)</li>\n<li>Transport your cooler in the passenger seat of your car, not the trunk.</li>\n<li>Store your cooler in the shade or under a blanket.</li>\n<li>Cover food to prevent flies and other pests from landing on the food.</li>\n<li>Throw away food that has been sitting out for an hour or longer.</li>\n<li>Bring a food thermometer to make sure you cook foods to the proper temperature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The food itself isn’t the only source of risk at a picnic. Bad grilling habits can cause fires, so you should also remember to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only grill outdoors.</li>\n<li>Set your grill on a flat surface away from your house and any tree branches.</li>\n<li>Don’t throw starter fluid on already-ignited charcoal.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to your grill whenever it’s on and be sure to turn it of when you’re finished.</li>\n<li>Keep a spray bottle or fire extinguisher on hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following these Fourth of July safety tips can help you and your family enjoy a fun, accident-free holiday. Stay safe, everybody!</p>"

    body: "<p>While the Pelican State isn’t exactly known for ice and snow, Louisiana winters can get cold. And if you’re caught unprepared, you may end up with hefty heating bills and costly repairs. Worse? You may end up having to file an insurance claim and risk paying high premiums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/winterize-your-home/\">Winterizing your home</a> can help reduce risk and help you avoid costly damage and claims. Moreover, the change in seasons can be a good cue to do some of the <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">routine home maintenance</a> and preparation that keeps your home safe and sound throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howbadarelouisianawinters\">How Bad Are Louisiana Winters?</h2>\n<p>Louisiana winters are short and mild compared to other areas of the country. Even in northern parts of Louisiana, winter temperatures are typically well above freezing at 37 degrees Fahrenheit. Southern Louisiana temperatures seldom go below 46 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>But Louisiana winter storms are not unheard of. In February, 2021, 23 parishes experienced winter weather so extreme that the governor requested and received <a href=\"https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3004\">a major disaster declaration</a>. There’s actually been at least six notable snowfalls since 2000, but the fact that winter weather events are so infrequent is part of the problem. Few Louisianans put much stock in winterizing their homes, so when bad weather does come, it often causes more trouble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforabadlouisianawinter\">How to Prepare for a Bad Louisiana Winter</h2>\n<p>Preparing for winter should be something that you do every year because you never know what has changed since you last checked it. For example, maybe you installed insulation last year only to find that a rodent has chewed through it. You’ll want to replace your insulation – and deal with the pesky rodent!</p>\n<p>Luckily, Louisiana’s mild winters make preparation easy. This basic home winterization checklist can help you reduce risks and the chances of filing a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana home insurance</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unclog your gutters.</strong> Remove leaves, dirt, and debris to prevent your gutters from getting clogged, make it easier to remove melted snow (should you have any), and keep water from pooling near your home. Ideally, you’d do this as soon as the last autumn leaves fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Insulate your pipes.</strong> Frozen pipes can burst, and that leads to flooding. The average cost of a burst pipe, <a href=\"https://www.fixr.com/costs/burst-pipe-repair\">between $200 and $1,000</a>, causes many homeowners to file insurance claims.But the better option is to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-keep-pipes-from-freezing/\">keep your pipes from freezing</a> in the first place. As an added bonus, insulating your pipes can reduce your heating costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean your chimney.</strong> Have your chimney inspected and cleaned once every year by a professional to remove creosote, the residue that can build up and cause fires. A professional can also check your chimney cap for wear and tear and make sure there are no obstructions.</li>\n<li><strong>Prune your trees.</strong> Gardening experts generally recommend <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">trimming trees in the late fall and early winter</a>. This is particularly true for deciduous trees because the leaves have fallen and you can see the tree more clearly.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your flood readiness.</strong> The rainy season is long gone, but that makes the winter months a good opportunity to review your flood preparedness. Look for ways to move appliances to higher positions so you don’t have to should floodwaters rise. You might also want to review (or make!) <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">your disaster plan</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect your storm shutters.</strong> Chances are your hurricane shutters have made it through at least a storm or two. Now that hurricane season has officially ended, take a moment to look over your <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> and consider repairing or replacing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This may also be the best time to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare for a hurricane</a> by checking your supplies and stocking up on anything that’s missing or running low. Granted, that’s not a Louisiana winterization tip, but you’d be better off having what you need on hand than running out to get it when a storm is on the way.</p>\n<p>Finally, take a moment to think back over the year. Have you made any renovations to your home? Gone through any major life chances, like a marriage or divorce? These things can impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, so if that sounds like you, talk to your agent about adjusting your coverage.</p>\n<p>With a little forward thinking and planning you can avoid costly mistakes that damage your home this winter.</p>"

    body: "<p>Got a question about fences? You came to the right place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everythingyoueverwantedtoknowaboutfences\">Everything you ever wanted to know about fences</h2>\n<p>Do you remember Robert Frost’s poem, “<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44266/mending-wall\">Mending Wall,</a>” from high school English? He spends some time contemplating whether or not “good fences make good neighbors” – today, this question seems easy enough to answer. A well-maintained fence can ease tension along a property line, as long as both parties are communicating openly and honestly.</p>\n<p>Spring makes us think a lot about our yards, landscaping opportunities, and how nice a white picket fence would look beside the driveway. Here, we’ll review the kinds of fences out there, how a good fence benefits your home, and why it’s a good idea to talk (nicely) to those who share your property lines before erecting any barriers.</p>\n<p>We’ll also answer a few common questions that often come up around fences and your homeowners insurance coverage, like “Does homeowners insurance cover fences?” and “Does my homeowners insurance cover my fence if a tree breaks it to smithereens?” to ease your mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fences101whyinstallafence\">Fences 101: Why install a fence?</h2>\n<p>A fence won’t necessarily add value to your property, but there are many good reasons to install one. Maybe you want more privacy at your backyard barbeques. Maybe the neighborhood deer are too fond of your garden. A fence can be a great way to increase your own comfort by adding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong>. Do you enjoy doing yoga outdoors in the morning light? Do you have a hot tub that you don’t want to share with the neighbors? Both are valid reasons to put up a fence.</li>\n<li><strong>Security / safety</strong>. A fence at its most basic keeps uninvited folks off your property. It creates an obstacle between your home and would-be burglars. Plus, if you have a swimming pool, it is a necessary boundary to protect the public.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear boundaries</strong>. Perhaps you’re concerned about a neighbor encroaching on your property line, or maybe it’s question of public use. If you live next to a school bus stop and the neighborhood kids have been tearing up the grass on your corner while they wait each morning, adding a fence can help enforce your property line.</li>\n<li><strong>Peace and quiet</strong>. If your house is located in a city where there’s heavy traffic or out in the suburbs near a major roadway, noise pollution can have a serious impact on your health and stress levels. The right fence can add soundproofing to make your outdoor and indoor spaces more comfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatkindoffenceisrightforyourproperty\">What kind of fence is right for your property?</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.bobvila.com/articles/types-of-fence-materials/\">many kinds of fences</a> – the right choice will depend on your motivations, your needs, and your budget.</p>\n<p>If you’ve always dreamed of having a white picket fence, that’s probably available to you. If you’re looking for a simple chain-link fence to establish a barrier between your garage access and the alley behind it, you know what to buy! Before you go to the hardware store, consider these four factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Location</strong>. Where do you want to place your fence? Are you using it to mark a property line, or do you want an ornamental length of fencing along your garden? Once you know where you’d like to place it, measure the space and map your design.</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>. Are you trying to keep your dog safe in your backyard or are you trying to block noise from the adjacent freeway? Different goals will lead you to very different materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Height</strong>. Is your fence meant to keep out strangers or is it a decoration meant to add that last touch of quaintness to your homestead? A low two-rail fence will not protect against intruders the way a five- or seven-foot fence will.</li>\n<li><strong>Material</strong>. The intended function of your fence will do a lot of determine what materials you pick. If you’re struggling to decide between vinyl or wood, cost may be the primary factor, but you should also consider longevity, as well as the cost to repair over time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whatever you choose, don’t forget to consider the cost of maintenance. Wood and vinyl require cleaning, while stone may require weeding. Wood also needs to be resealed, stained, or painted periodically.</p>\n<p>Over time, all fences will degrade in some way. Knowing how much effort you’re willing to put in will help you determine what kind of fence is right for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisafencecoveredbyhomeownersinsurance\">When is a fence covered by homeowners insurance?</h2>\n<p>Your fence is likely included in your insurance under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>, also known as other structures insurance. This means that as part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, your fence is protected against the same risks as your home, including protection in case of fire, theft, vandalism, and wind, among other things.</p>\n<p>Of course, if your fence is vandalized or someone drives their car through it, you should first file a police report to make sure the incident and damage are documented there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anoteonotherstructurescoverage\">A note on other structures coverage</h3>\n<p>Other structures insurance is typically calculated as 10 percent of the value of the main structure. If your house is insured for $175,000, your fence and garage would be protected for up to $17,500.</p>\n<p>This percentage can be adjusted to add extra protection. Make sure you compare the value of your other structures to your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenafenceisntcoveredbyyourhomeownersinsurance\">When a fence isn’t covered by your homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>Wear and tear on your fence isn’t covered by your homeowners insurance. It’s likely your responsibility to make repairs if your fence starts to lean over time, if the footings come out of the ground due to erosion, or if you start to see signs of mildew or rot.</p>\n<p>As with any structure you own, it’s important to take care of your fence, whether that means removing debris from the chainlink after a long winter, spraying it down to cut on the possibility of rust, or whitewashing the wood slats, so make sure you weave your fence into your regular <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance plan</a>.</p>\n<p>Another note: In the event that your fence sustains major damage from a flood, it would likely not be covered your homeowners insurance or flood insurance. If you live in a place with a high flood risk, consider the cost of replacement before deciding to install a fence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoresearchyourpropertylineandanyrestrictions\">How to research your property line and any restrictions</h2>\n<p>Before installing a fence, there are four things you can do to confirm your property line and restrictions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check your deed</strong>. You’ll find a written description of your lot and its boundaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Review the survey</strong>. This can be found in the town or city records if you’re having trouble digging up a copy of your sale documents. Some towns even have them available online.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/blog/how-do-i-find-my-property-lines-150061/\">Hire a surveyor</a>. If you have any doubts about where your property lines are and you’re planning on investing in a major structure, whether that be a shed, a new fence, or an addition to your house, consider <a href=\"https://www.improvenet.com/r/costs-and-prices/land-survey-cost-estimator\">the cost of hiring a surveyor</a> a sound investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your local regulations</strong>. Whether that’s within your city or in your homeowner’s association, make sure you know the height restrictions that apply to the place where you’re dreaming of putting up a fence. You can typically find this information online or at the town hall. Depending on where you live, you may need a permit or you may encounter height limits. It’s always better to be ahead of this process than to try to make corrections (and pay fines) after the fact.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before you embark on any home improvement, you should know what’s yours and what belongs to someone else. It’s common for local jurisdictions to have explicit rules about how far a fence must be set back from the property line. If you don’t know those rules, you can’t design your fence.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with your yard and your local rulebook before you make any financial or material commitments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodiscussthepropertylinecommunicationtips\">How to discuss the property line: communication tips</h2>\n<p>While you likely have the right to put a fence on your land if you’d like to, it’s a good idea to talk to your neighbors before making any major changes to your property that may impact their views. This isn’t to say that you should ask for their permission, but it’s wise to have a frank conversation in which you describe your plans.</p>\n<p>If your new fence will obstruct their views, they may be upset. Your home is an investment; it’s the place you go back to at the end of each day, and it’s important that you feel comfortable there – and the same is true for your neighbors. With this in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be proactive</strong>. Let your neighbor know you’re considering adding a fence to your property as far in advance as possible. If your neighbor walks over to your property line to ask what you’re doing because they see your contractor starting to dig footings, you’ve waited too long to discuss your new fence calmly. In this case, if your neighbor has any doubts about the position of your fence, you could find yourself facing delays while you hire a surveyor. And in the meantime, you’re stuck with a neighbor whose trust you may have lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Be direct</strong>. We’re not kidding. Let your neighbor know as much as you can so they know what to expect. If one day a 10-foot green vinyl wall appears just across the property line beside their living room windows, they may feel distressed. Be clear and detailed when you share your plans: if you’re building a fortress for privacy, say so. It’s better to know in advance to set expectations and when appropriate, provide room for compromise.</li>\n<li><strong>Be kind</strong>. You plan to live in your home on your land for many happy years and so do your neighbors. Treat them with the same decency and respect you’d like to receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neighborly disputes can have a huge impact on how you feel in your space. It’s in everyone’s best interest that things remain calm and considerate. If you can’t avoid blocking their view, which may impact their home’s value, you’ll need to carefully think through your plan before letting them know what changes are ahead.</p>\n<p>A functional or decorative fence can reinforce the visual boundary between neighbors’ properties without interrupting anyone’s day. The key is to start with an honest conversation and make sure your intentions are clear. Of course, it can’t hurt to bring a plate of cookies when you go next door to chat.</p>"

    body: "<p>Halloween can be especially scary for homeowners. Between accidental fires and unexpected company (supernatural or otherwise), it’s no wonder insurers see upticks in vandalism and property damage claims this time of year.</p>\n<p>Here are the eight spooky incidents that could darken your door and trigger home insurance claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1jackolanternfires\">1. Jack-O’-Lantern Fires</h2>\n<p>Jack-o’-lanterns can easily be more trick than treat in the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>Over the three-day period around Halloween, 10,100 fires were reported in the US each year from 2014 to 2016, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/snapshot-halloween.pdf\">according to the US Fire Administration</a>. These fires caused 30 deaths, 125 injuries, and $102 million in property damage. Of these fires, 32 percent are residential.</p>\n<p>The most common culprits? Cooking, heating, and pure recklessness.</p>\n<p>Take the father who placed a <a href=\"https://www.wtvr.com/2015/10/30/pumpkin-fire/\">grill lighter in an upside down pumpkin</a> that wasn’t fully carved. Fumes built up inside the pumpkin and caused a flash fire, resulting in second-degree burns.</p>\n<p>Home insurance should cover fire damage to your home and belongings, but play it safe! Instead of real candles in your jack-o’-lantern, try flameless votives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2thecaseofthedeadlypeanuts\">2. The Case of the Deadly Peanuts</h2>\n<p>One in three children have a food allergy, causing 3,800 Halloween-related injuries each year. About <a href=\"https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-impact-of-peanut-allergies\">2.5 percent of all children in the US</a> are allergic to peanuts.</p>\n<p>That can be an issue if you pass out candy to children on Halloween. If a child has an allergic reaction to your treat, you could be sued for their medical bills.</p>\n<p>To keep scary allergic reactions at bay, consider handing out allergy-friendly candies. Check the labels and keep an eye out for mischievous peanuts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3postdeathcleanup\">3. Post-Death Cleanup</h2>\n<p>Our home insurance covers your dwelling on an <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">all-risk basis</a>, meaning it covers a lot of unexpected sources of damage.</p>\n<p>A particularly tragic example? Death cleanup costs.</p>\n<p>If someone dies in the house (depending on the circumstance), home insurance may cover some of the removal and remediation costs if there’s damage to the home (as is often the case with unattended deaths).</p>\n<p>No, it can’t help you get rid of ghosts. That’s a job for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289401/\">another set of experts</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4ahouseswallowedbytheearth\">4. A House Swallowed by the Earth</h2>\n<p>Picture this: you’re sitting at home when all of a sudden you notice the corner of your bathroom cascading into the ground. To the best of your knowledge, your home was not built on a <a href=\"https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Hellmouth\">hellmouth</a> – so what in the world could it be?</p>\n<p>Sinkholes swallow Florida homes more often than you might think. In fact, this exact situation <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sinkhole-swallows-house-florida-apopka-2017-9#\">happened to a family in Apopka, Florida</a>, after Hurricane Irma.</p>\n<p>While sinkholes are not covered by all insurers, all Florida homeowners insurance companies offer <a href=\"/glossary/catastrophic-ground-cover-collapse/\">catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage</a> to all policyholders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5eerielibations\">5. Eerie Libations</h2>\n<p>Did you know 86 percent of adults bring alcohol to Halloween parties? If you’re hosting a spooky soiree at your house, those cups of liquid courage can lead to accidents that you could be liable for. For example, if a guest imbibes too much and falls off your porch, you may be responsible for those medical expenses.</p>\n<p>In some states, you may even be responsible for accidents and injuries your inebriated guests cause even after they leave your party.</p>\n<p>Scary, right?</p>\n<p>Good thing homeowners insurance might pay for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">immediate medical expenses</a> when guests have small injuries on your property, depending on how it happened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6whencujoattacks\">6. When Cujo Attacks</h2>\n<p>We know your precious pooch wouldn’t hurt a fly (though a steak is another story). But dogs are still animals, and sometimes they act in unpredictable ways. Plus costumes can really stress out some dogs, <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/halloween-safety-tips\">according to the ASPCA</a>, which means your pup may wake up on October 31 and choose chaos.</p>\n<p>The CDC estimates <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00047723.htm\">4.7 million people sustain dog bites</a> each year, 800,000 of which require medical care. If your dog does bite someone, you are responsible for those medical expenses.</p>\n<p>Your home insurance policy may help cover those costs if you added on <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability coverage</a> (and depending on the breed). This is the only coverage that can help pay for bodily injuries and property damage your rambunctious pup (or other domestic pets) may cause.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7mysteriousanimalencounters\">7. Mysterious Animal Encounters</h2>\n<p>You wake to commotion coming from the kitchen one morning. You hear pots and pans hit the floor, the shatter of broken plates. As you cautiously approach, nothing could have prepared you for the surreal, spine-chilling horror of seeing a 400-pound black bear standing in your home.</p>\n<p>That’s what happened to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/15/us/colorado-bear-kitchen-trnd/index.html\">man in Colorado who barely escaped with his life</a>. It sounds like his garage door may have taken a hit.</p>\n<p>If a bear wanders into your home and causes mayhem, a homeowners policy may cover that kind of damage to the dwelling, depending on where you live and the exact language in the policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8uninvitedghouls\">8. Uninvited Ghouls</h2>\n<p>Halloween is prime time for trespassing and mischief – a time when unauthorized guests trample your perfectly manicured lawn or smash your pumpkins.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even if an uninvited guest is on your property, you can be held responsible for their injuries.</p>\n<p>So if a little ghost trips over the tombstones decorating the lawn or swings from the witch dangling from your tree and falls, those medical expenses could be on you. Fortunately, medical payments coverage or your personal liability insurance can help cover that.</p>\n<p>And if a scoundrel vandalizes your home, home insurance may cover those repair and cleanup costs, too (depending on your policy's language).</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidhalloweenhorrorsandhomeinsuranceclaims\">How to Avoid Halloween Horrors (and Home Insurance Claims)</h2>\n<p>Keep the scares at bay with these Halloween safety tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear your walkways.</strong> Pick up all tripping hazards, like pumpkins, electrical cords, and wet leaves.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure your railings.</strong> Don't let visitors don’t take a spill on your steps. Check your handrails to make sure they’re sturdy.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your pets inside.</strong> Don’t give your pets a chance to escape or accidentally attack visitors. Keep them indoors where you can make sure they’re safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Be smart with your decor.</strong> Skip the flames and use glow sticks or LED candles to light up jack-o’-lanterns. If your decorations require an outlet, make sure you keep the cords clear of walkways.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your porch lights on.</strong> Reduce the chance of tricks like theft and vandalism. Leave your outdoor lights on to deter visits from ne'er do wells.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure your guests have a safe way to get home.</strong> Don't let revellers drink and drive! Offer to call a cab or rideshare if they've celebrated a little too much.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking for more Halloween adventure this Fall, check out these <a href=\"/blog/florida-ghost-towns/\">Florida ghost towns</a> that can give you the spooks.</p>"

    body: "<p>Like everything else this year, COVID-19 is changing how we do Halloween, too. If you still want to celebrate the spooky season, here’s how you and your family can do it safely, according to the CDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isitsafetotrickortreatin2020\">Is It Safe to Trick-or-Treat in 2020?</h2>\n<p>It depends on how it’s done. The same pandemic rules apply – gathering in large groups is still high-risk for transmission, but Halloween can be celebrated in a <a href=\"/blog/work-from-home-tips/\">socially distanced way</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the CDC, it’s only a moderate risk to participate in one-way trick-or-treating. This is where you line up individually wrapped treat bags for families to grab from a distance, like the end of your yard or driveway. If you want to leave treat bags this year, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water while singing “Happy Birthday” twice before and after you handle the bags.</p>\n<p>Leaving a candy bowl on the porch or at the end of the driveway is another solution. The risk of transmission from surface bacteria is lower than scientists originally thought. That said, leave out hand sanitizer for trick-or-treaters, and if your kids are participating, make sure they sanitize their hands before and after reaching into communal candy bowls. They should stick with the first piece they touch.</p>\n<p>Here are some other pointers for safe trick-or-treating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your children stay six feet away from other trick-or-treaters and parents.</li>\n<li>Don’t share candy bowls, props, toys, or masks with other children.</li>\n<li>Bring hand sanitizer and use it after each stop.</li>\n<li>Don’t touch your face. Help your children practice – it may be hard when they’re jazzed up about their costumes!</li>\n<li>Wear face masks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/halloween-social-distancing.jpg?width=1938&name=halloween-social-distancing.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"lowriskhalloweenactivitiestoenjoywiththefamily\">Low-Risk Halloween Activities to Enjoy with the Family</h2>\n<p>It may take a little creativity to maintain the spirit of the season while staying in. Try these perfectly safe activities with your household:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decorate pumpkins and display them outdoors.</li>\n<li>Decorate pumpkins outside with neighbors or friends at least six feet apart.</li>\n<li>Decorate your house, apartment, or yard.</li>\n<li>Take a stroll with your family to admire Halloween decorations at a distance.</li>\n<li>Have a virtual Halloween costume contest.</li>\n<li>Watch Halloween movies with your household.</li>\n<li>Make and decorate Halloween cookies together. <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/fluffy-1-bowl-sugar-cookies-vegan-gf/\">This recipe is friendly for most diets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highriskhalloweenactivitiestoavoid\">High-Risk Halloween Activities to Avoid</h2>\n<p>According to the CDC, these are high-risk Halloween festivities you’re encouraged to skip this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional trick-or-treating where children go door-to-door and treats are handed out. The more households you visit, the greater the chance that germs can linger and spread.</li>\n<li>Trick-or-treating in large groups where social distancing is difficult to maintain.</li>\n<li>Attending crowded indoor costume parties.</li>\n<li>Visiting an indoor haunted house where folks are crowded together and screaming.</li>\n<li>Traveling outside your community to visit a rural fall festival, especially if you live in an area with higher COVID-19 rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"basichalloweensafetytips\">Basic Halloween Safety Tips</h2>\n<p>Even without COVID, Halloween can be a dangerous time of year for children. <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/tools-resources/seasonal-safety/autumn/halloween\">According to the National Safety Council</a>, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car on Halloween than on any other day of the year.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to stay safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure all costumes, wigs, and props are fire-resistant.</li>\n<li>Fasten reflective tape to costumes and bags, or give children glow sticks to make sure they’re visible in the dark.</li>\n<li>Make sure Halloween makeup is nontoxic and do a patch test before applying it.</li>\n<li>Accompany your children while they trick-or-treat.</li>\n<li>Plan an acceptable route if your children are old enough to trick-or-treat on their own and establish a time for them to be home.</li>\n<li>Instruct children never to accept a ride from a stranger or enter a stranger’s home.</li>\n<li>Don’t let children eat any treats before you have a chance to inspect them.</li>\n<li>Look both ways before crossing the street and pay attention while walking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"keepyourhomesafefortrickortreaters\">Keep Your Home Safe for Trick-or-Treaters</h2>\n<p>Halloween is also a prime time for injuries. Remember, you can be held responsible for any injury that happens on your property. To limit that risk, be sure to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clean up before trick-or-treaters arrive</strong>. Make sure all walkways are clear of tripping hazards, like garden hoses, toys, and decorations, and slipping hazards, like leaves or snow.</li>\n<li><strong>Turn on the porch lights</strong>. Make sure your walkway is clearly visible.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your pets inside</strong>. If your excitable pup bites a child, you may be responsible for those medical bills, and poor Fido could face consequences, too. Keep everyone safe by keeping your animal companions at bay.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider food allergies when leaving out candy</strong>. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/foodallergies/index.htm\">most serious allergic reactions</a> in the United States are caused by milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts. About <a href=\"https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-impact-of-peanut-allergies\">2.5 percent of all children in the US</a> are allergic to peanuts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stay safe, you lovely ghouls, and have fun!</p>"

    body: "<p><em>\"I think of ghosts and haunting as just being alert. If you are really alert, then you see the life that exists beyond the life that is on top.\"\n– Toni Morrison, author & national treasure</em></p>\n<p>Before we dive into some seriously spooky stories, you should know that <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> doesn't cover damage caused by the paranormal. So what can you do if your house is haunted?</p>\n<p>In this special edition of our blog, we’ll present to you four true stories of homes that were haunted – along with what the people involved did to get their lives back to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theghostwholovedbacon\">The Ghost Who Loved Bacon</h2>\n<p>Paul Allen, who runs the micro-distillery <a href=\"http://www.hopespringsdistillery.com/\">Hope Springs Distillery</a> with his wife in Lilburn, Georgia, was careful to tell us that he isn’t usually a believer in the whole “haunting” thing.</p>\n<p>“Our household is basically crackpot free,” he said. “I’m a 40-year veteran engineer, and my wife is a recovering attorney.” She’s also a talented glass artist. Over the years, he said, “we grew close to a fellow with 25 years as a nearby shop owner selling the raw materials for her glass work.”</p>\n<p>In that time, Paul said, they often heard the shop owner discuss the “spirits” in his shop. They all had names, kept to specific areas, and were said to be friendly.</p>\n<p>“I spoke to a couple of his employees, and they noted that, yes, there was ‘someone’ there,” Paul told us. While everyone at the shop more or less coexisted with these beings, they didn’t like feeling as if someone was running fingers through their hair when nobody was around.</p>\n<p>Things might have continued indefinitely like this if not for renovation plans.</p>\n<p>“The old downtown area was about to be massively refurbished,” Paul said, “so the shop owner decided to shut it down and move. One afternoon, my wife and I visited for the last time. When she and the proprietor went into the office to handle some business, I stood in the middle of the empty store, and said aloud that it appeared the spirits were about to be homeless, and if they wanted, they could come stay with us.”</p>\n<p>He meant it as a joke.</p>\n<p>But when Paul and his wife got home, the strangeness began almost immediately.</p>\n<p>First, it was smells: cigar smoke, roses, and bacon cooking. House guests would ask who’d been cooking bacon in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>Things steadily worsened, including late-night screeching fits by the <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet</a> parrot. The cats refused to go into certain areas of the house. But then came the knife.</p>\n<p>“I was cooking dinner when a large knife flew from beside the stove to the casing of the kitchen door,” said Allen. “I can professionally state that things that are thrown and released will follow a specific downward path, whereas this one went straight and horizontally – I measured the departure and landing points. It was clearly moved there, not thrown.”</p>\n<p>The last straw for Allen was seeing something floating up the stairs.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I prayed, not out of fear but desperation to be rid of this thing,” he said. “I reminded whatever it was that ‘we’ were given dominion over this earth, and thus its time was up – leave!”</p>\n<p>It did, he reports. Seriously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theghostwholeftbruises\">The Ghost Who Left Bruises</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/haunted-house-1.jpg?width=500&name=haunted-house-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>John Stewart reached out to us with a much more sinister story of a haunted home.</p>\n<p>It all started when he met the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. They both had their own homes, and every time John visited hers, he felt uncomfortable, as if he were being watched.</p>\n<p>“It got to the point that I would spin around, expecting somebody to be there,” he said. But nobody ever was.</p>\n<p>Whenever he visited the house, strange things happened – doors slammed upstairs when he was in the house alone downstairs and all the window were shut. He’d feel the weight of a body sitting on the foot of the bed.</p>\n<p>When John and his partner decided to move in together, he made it clear he would not move into her house. But he agreed to help her <a href=\"/blog/low-rates-a-remodel-away/\">renovate</a> so they could get a better price when they sold it. That’s when things got really serious.</p>\n<p>“The minute I started renovating, things started to ramp up,” he said. “It felt like someone in the basement was hitting the ceiling with a sledgehammer.” He started to see shadow people in his peripheral vision. His tools would go missing.</p>\n<p>Then when he started renovations on the final room – an upstairs bathroom – he saw objects levitating. He heard footsteps running toward him. All of a sudden, he felt as if he were covered in cobwebs and filled with an electrical charge. The longer he stood still, the more uncomfortable the feeling became. He finally managed to run from the room, but then felt the presence push him down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When he finished renovations, he was relieved: he could put the haunting behind him.</p>\n<p>Except he couldn’t.</p>\n<p>“The next thing I know,” he said, “I was watching TV at my house, and from the wall next to it, out walks this shadow person, right into my living room.”</p>\n<p>The visits became daily, then more frequent. John felt the presence push him. One night his foot was squeezed so hard he had bruises the next day. Finally, he couldn’t take any more. He called a paranormal group to investigate, deciding that if they found nothing, he’d have to seek treatment from a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p>But the group found plentiful signs of paranormal activity, and John reframed the way he dealt with the activity.</p>\n<p>“I was running away from it,” he said. “Now I run toward it.” He does that in the form of his podcast, <a href=\"https://castbox.fm/channel/Phantom-Faction-Podcast-id1287947\">Phantom Faction</a>, where he takes calls from people going through experiences similar to his own.</p>\n<p>To hear John tell the story in his own words, listen to <a href=\"https://jimharold.com/laughing-ghost-campfire-360/\">episode 360</a> of the Campfire podcast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehomebodyghost\">The Homebody Ghost</h2>\n<p>This next story shows even a benign ghost can be an unnerving experience. Sarah Hancock and her husband Jonny moved into Jonny’s brother’s house while their home was being built. The brother’s family (him, his wife, and their three kids) slept upstairs; Sarah and Jonny slept in the basement.</p>\n<p>“Shortly after we moved in, we started to notice some strange happenings,” said Sarah. “Jonny and I would be in the basement and hear what sounded like footsteps walking around upstairs when we were the only ones home.”</p>\n<p>Once during the middle of the night, she woke up and swore she heard someone jiggling the bedroom doorknob.

    body: "<p>Hosting a free haunted house? Your homeowners insurance should cover your risks. Charging admission? You’ll need separate haunted house insurance.</p>\n<p>Last year, we celebrated Halloween by bringing you <a href=\"/blog/haunted-homes/\">four real-life tales of haunted homes</a>. This year, we’re taking a more practical approach, explaining how insurance can help homeowners with a haunted house. We’re going to tackle the two meanings of “haunted house insurance,” looking at both what kinds of insurance coverage you should have in place if you’re planning to invite people over for a spooky adventure you’ve orchestrated and how your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> will be affected if you live in an honest-to-goodness haunted house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoinsureahauntedhouse\">How to Insure a Haunted House</h2>\n<p>If you’re going to invite people over for classic Halloween thrills and chills (think: peeled-grape “eyeballs” and cooked-spaghetti “brains” to squeeze in a dark room), the most important question for insurance purposes is whether or not you’ll charge for admission.</p>\n<p>“If you choose to charge admission to your haunted house, you need to consider the commercial aspects of your insurance policy,” said Ross Martin, a licensed agent with insurance comparison site <a href=\"http://www.thezebra.com/\">The Zebra</a>.</p>\n<p>“The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability portion of your coverage</a> could also be negated if you charge admission,” he added. “This is the coverage that protects you if someone suffers an injury on your property. With this coverage negated, the homeowner is at risk and might have to pay for damages or injuries out of pocket.”</p>\n<p>Robert DiCristofaro, an independent insurance broker with <a href=\"http://www.1stcannon.com/\">1st Cannon, LLC</a>, agreed: “[A haunted house] is no different than any other party in the insurance company’s eyes,” he said. “As long as you’re not charging for entry.”</p>\n<p>Why does selling tickets impact your homeowners insurance? Because most homeowners policies explicitly exclude any business-related activities. And if you’re making money on the operation, your haunted house is considered a business.</p>\n<p>To make sure you have adequate insurance for your haunted house, you have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t charge admission</strong>. This is the simplest solution and will prevent your haunted house from negating the liability and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">property coverage</a> you enjoy from your homeowners insurance policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Purchase a business insurance policy</strong>. This is both more complicated and more expensive. But if your haunted house is a financial investment and it makes sense to charge admission, it’s important to have insurance. In addition to exploring business insurance, you might want to check your state’s and county’s laws on business zoning to make sure you’re allowed to operate a profit-generating haunted house from your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you’re not planning to make money from your haunted house, you’ll want to make sure the liability portion of your standard homeowners policy is up to the task of covering your guests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A haunted house is no different than any other party in the insurance company’s eyes – unless you're charging admission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"managingliabilityatafreehauntedhouse\">Managing Liability at a Free Haunted House</h2>\n<p>Even if you're not charging admission, both Martin and DiCristofaro say that it never hurts to make sure your homeowners policy is ready for the haunted house.</p>\n<p>“You might want to make sure you have adequate liability levels before the party,” said DiCristofaro. “If someone is injured, as we all know, medical bills can rack up quickly, and you don’t want to get stuck footing the bill.”</p>\n<p>Martin suggested taking the time to make sure your property is as safe as possible, which might mean removing tripping hazards, lighting outdoor steps and walkways, repairing cracks in the sidewalk, and providing enough light to prevent stumbling in the haunted house itself.</p>\n<p>“Also,” he added, “[It’s] probably best to avoid having one of those chainsaw-wielding madmen that are common in many of the larger commercial haunted houses.”</p>\n<p>We very much agree. But what if your house is <em>actually</em> haunted? How will your insurance company deal with that?</p>\n<h2 id=\"insuringahauntedproperty\">Insuring a Haunted Property</h2>\n<p>DiCristafaro was categorical when we asked him about truly haunted houses: “Insurance companies don’t believe in ghosts for one reason: they insure physical property, and physical things are rarely affected by intangible things. I have never seen a question about ghosts on an insurance application, or had a company increase rates because a house was haunted.”</p>\n<p>In other words: insurance companies don’t think ghosts exist, so they won’t require any special insurance if you think there’s a ghost in your home.</p>\n<p>Martin concurred on this point, noting that a ghost story or house’s history aren’t likely to affect the cost or insurance eligibility of a home.</p>\n<p>“On the other hand,” he said, “If a home is famous (or infamous) for some reason, this could possibly drive up costs as more people may attempt to visit the property, leading to potential accidents or theft.”</p>\n<p>He went on to explain that the real issue with haunted houses (which are called “stigmatized properties” in the real estate industry) is with selling.</p>\n<p>“In most states,” he explained, “A seller is required to disclose such issues (murder, cult activity, suicide, etc.). In many places, sellers must even disclose whether a house is haunted, though this is usually a sign of more explainable issues such as gas leaks or foundation problems.”</p>\n<p>And if the house does have gas leaks or foundation problems, well, your insurance provider will definitely want to know about them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The official stance of insurance companies: ghosts don't exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"otherconsiderationsforhalloweenmischiefnight\">Other Considerations for Halloween &amp; Mischief Night</h2>\n<p>Even if you’ll have no association with a haunted house this Halloween (whether real or orchestrated), Halloween and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief_Night\">Mischief Night</a> (also known as Devil’s Night, Goosey Night, Cabbage Night, Gate Night, and Moving Night) can present some insurance challenges.</p>\n<p>To ensure that you, your home, and any trick-or-treaters you welcome stay safe, make sure you do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Park in a sheltered area, if possible</strong>. Egging cars is common on Mischief Night, so if you have a garage, park your car inside. Egg left on a car can damage its paint and is, in any case, annoying to clean off.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring decorative pumpkins and outdoor furniture inside</strong>. Another common pastime: smashing pumpkins and moving outdoor furniture. If Mischief Night is “celebrated” in your area, consider bringing in your decorations while it’s dark out.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide adequate outdoor lighting</strong>. When Halloween itself rolls around, you’ll want to make sure trick-or-treaters can see where they’re walking (especially if they’re wearing masks). That means making sure your outdoor lights are in good working order.</li>\n<li><strong>Repair or highlight any tripping hazards</strong>. If you don’t have time to fix a cracked driveway, for example, a traffic cone can help prevent unexpected falls. If you can remove the hazard, though, doing so might prevent injuries.</li>\n<li><strong>Mention any allergens in the candy you distribute</strong>. Most parents of kids with allergies know what to avoid. But if you’re giving out anything homemade or out of its package, be sure to mention the presence of the eight most common allergens: milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, soy, fish. (Though if you’re giving out a treat with shellfish or fish… maybe rethink some things.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, ensuring you have a safe home shouldn’t only happen around Halloween.

    body: "<p>Kin is proud to serve homeowners in the Peach State.</p>\n<p>Here at Kin, we’re on a quest to offer better insurance to every homeowner in the United States. And we’re thrilled to announce that Georgia is now on the list of states where <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">our coverage</a> is available.</p>\n<p>Why? Georgia’s great, as you probably know. I mean, you’ve got peaches, which are nice, but let’s not forget the North Georgia mountains. And red dirt? That’s just cool. Oh, and being the birthplace of Martin Luther King, Jr., Amy Grant, Michael Stipe, and Ty Cobb doesn’t hurt, either.</p>\n<p>And now the state really has it all, because as of today <a href=\"/home-insurance/georgia/\">Georgia</a> residents have a better way to buy homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s slow down and offer a more formal introduction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"higeorgiawerekininsurance\">Hi, Georgia. We’re Kin Insurance.</h2>\n<p>We’re a company dedicated to simplifying home insurance and making homes safer for Georgia homeowners.</p>\n<p><strong><em>How?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We make home insurance simpler by using thousands of publicly available data points to guide us. All you have to do is enter your address and our system pulls up a customized insurance quote for your home.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can these “customized quotes”</em></strong> <strong><em>save me money?</em></strong></p>\n<p>In many cases, yes. Old-school insurance pricing relies on averages of aggregated information. And old-school insurance companies usually offer the same one-size-fits-all policy. When you apply through Kin, we look at everything from the age of your roof to whether you’ve got a pool and, if so, what type of fence you have around it. We look at when your electrical and plumbing systems were last updated. And then, based on all that information, we not only offer a customized price but also suggest a policy that offers exactly the coverage you need.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Is there anything Kin’s home insurance won’t cover?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Like all standard homeowners insurance policies, ours exclude protection for flooding, earthquakes, wear and tear, and mold. If you think you need coverage for any of those things, be sure to mention it to your Kin agent. We’re happy to help you figure out where to find coverage that can fill the gaps.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You said something about making homes safer for Georgia homeowners. What’s that all about?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Glad you asked. Our philosophy is that safer homes are in everyone’s best interest: yours, ours, your neighbors’, etc. So we try to do what we can to not only provide insurance for your home but also make that home as sturdy and secure as we can. For example, if we discover that your roof is a little older than what we consider ideal, we’ll connect you with people who can help you update it in such a way that it offers better protection and helps reduce your insurance premiums.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This all sounds great – but I already have insurance.</em></strong></p>\n<p>That’s fine! Your best bet in this case is to enter your address and see whether Kin can offer a policy that would save you a significant amount of money. Again, the process takes just a few minutes, so you should know pretty quickly whether it’s worth switching coverage, either right now or when your policy is set to renew. If you do want to switch coverage now, we can talk you through that process.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You’re making this sound very easy.</em></strong></p>\n<p>That’s the idea. We think buying home insurance should be easy. And our customers seem to think we’re doing a good job – check out our <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kin.com\">customer reviews</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What else should I know?</em></strong></p>\n<p>You may also want to read about <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">how we handled Hurricane Irma</a> last year, which affected a lot of our customers. By checking in via text message, we were able to get a sense of who needed help. And because customers could text us pictures of damage, we were able to start the claims process quickly.</p>\n<p><strong><em>So if I wanted to see whether you could cover me, what would I do?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Just <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">enter your address in our application</a>. We’ll put together a customized quote for you. If you’re in our underwriting sweet spot, you may even be able to buy the policy without talking to anyone. But our agents are always on hand to answer questions and help make sure you’re getting the coverage you want and need.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can I come talk to your agents in person?</em></strong></p>\n<p>You could – but they’re all based at our Chicago headquarters. One of the ways we save you money is by not paying to maintain branch locations all around the country. So if you’re up for a trip, come on over! If not, they’re available by phone.</p>\n<p>Seriously: if you have questions, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@kin.com\">support@kin.com</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Even the biggest homeowners insurance companies can’t insure every single home. There would be no way to pay claims if they did. So every company has underwriting guidelines that help them determine what homes and risks they will and won’t cover. Some homes that don’t fit these guidelines may be considered “high-risk homes,” and that can make them more complex to insure.</p>\n<p>This guide helps explain some common hard-to-insure risks, how you can address them, and how you can find high-risk homeowners insurance if you need to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6thingsthatcanmakehomeshardtoinsureandwhattodoaboutit\">6 things that can make homes hard to insure – and what to do about it</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1yourroofneedssomelove\">1. Your roof needs some love</h3>\n<p>If your <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof has been patched</a> or its shingles are deteriorating, it may be hard to find an insurer to cover your home, especially if you live in Florida where hurricanes are promised. Your roof is your first line of defense in protecting your home from strong storm winds. An old roof or a roof in disrepair might not provide the protection your home needs to weather the storm.</p>\n<p>Usually, it may be time to replace your roof if it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3-tab or asphalt shingles and is older than 15 years.</li>\n<li>Architectural shingles and is older than 20 years.</li>\n<li>Clay tiles, concrete tiles, slate, or metal and is older than 40 years.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">flat or shed shape</a> and is older than 10 years.</li>\n<li>Wood shake or shingles or asbestos materials.</li>\n<li>Existing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2yourelectricalpanelneedsanupdate\">2. Your electrical panel needs an update</h3>\n<p>Older electrical systems can be a big fire and safety risk. Knob and tube wiring, for example, is usually ungrounded and can cause electric shocks. Some electrical panels, such as Federal Pacific, Stab-Loc, Zinsco, Challenger, and Sylvania, have been known to overheat and cause fires when circuit breakers trip.</p>\n<p>Outdated or <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled panels</a> may need to be replaced before an insurer will offer a policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3yourhomedoesnthavecentralheatingorcooling\">3. Your home doesn’t have central heating or cooling</h3>\n<p>If you rely on wall or window AC units to cool your home, it could be a red flag for an insurance company. Wall AC units are prone to leaking in the wall, which can cause water and mold damage. Window units require the window to remain open, which creates a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-lack-security-basics/\">security risk</a>.</p>\n<p>Portable heating devices, such as space heaters and portable heaters, can increase your home’s risk of fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4youhaveabigrenovationinprogressoryourhomeisvacant\">4. You have a big renovation in progress or your home is vacant</h3>\n<p>If your home is undergoing a <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">major renovation</a> and you can’t occupy it for months on end, it may be hard to get coverage until the work is complete. Similarly, many insurance companies won’t cover a vacant home that doesn’t have furniture or utilities.</p>\n<p>If no one is around to keep an eye on things, an incident could go unnoticed for longer, which increases the severity of the loss. Think about it this way: if your kitchen catches fire while you’re around, you may have the opportunity to put it out or call the fire department right away. If your kitchen catches fire and you’re gone, the fire can spread and damage more of your home and belongings before help intervenes. Plus, an empty home is an easier target for theft.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5youhaveaningroundfuelorpropanetankonyourproperty\">5. You have an in-ground fuel or propane tank on your property</h3>\n<p>Because there’s no way for an <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">inspector</a> to verify the condition of an in-ground fuel or propane tank, these tend to give insurance companies pause. If a tank leaks into groundwater, it could be a liability issue. Essentially this risk is ineligible because it would be a big question mark on what insurers are agreeing to cover.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6yourunahomebasedbusiness\">6. You run a home-based business</h3>\n<p>Many homeowners insurance companies don’t offer business insurance, which is the type of coverage you’d need to cover your home-based business’s property and risks. While home insurance includes some coverage for business property, like a laptop, the limits are usually too low to address all your needs. Businesses also usually mean increased foot traffic and liability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highriskhomeownersinsuranceoptions\">High-risk homeowners insurance options</h2>\n<p>If you have a mortgage, you’re likely required to have home insurance. And if you’re struggling to find an insurer, there is an option worth exploring: your state’s Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan.</p>\n<p>If you’re in California or Florida, these are the numbers to call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/\">California FAIR Plan Association</a>: 213-487-0111</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.citizensfla.com/\">Citizens Property Insurance Corporation</a>: 866-411-2742</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FAIR is a government-run program designed to make sure every homeowner has access to insurance. That said, it’s designed to be an option of last resort if you can’t find a private insurer. These plans may offer less coverage than a typical homeowners policy. Still, it’s a much better option than not having insurance, especially if you live in an area prone to wildfires and hurricanes.</p>"

    body: "<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but people with particularly valuable homes often have a hard time getting insured. Let’s take a look at what high-value home insurance is, what it covers, and who needs it so you can decide if the coverage is right for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatishighvaluehomeinsurance\">What Is High-Value Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>High-value home insurance is a homeowners policy specially designed for houses worth more than $1 million. While high-value home policies are similar to standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> in many ways, they often offer unique benefits to policyholders, largely because people with higher-value homes tend to have slightly different needs.</p>\n<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, it’s worth emphasizing that the “high-value” here applies to the home, not the insurance. So if you have a “normal” value home in a risky area, you may need higher levels of insurance coverage, but you’ll still want to get <a href=\"/blog/not-so-basic-home-insurance/\">basic homeowners insurance</a>. You only need high-value home insurance if your home’s value exceeds the $1 million mark.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoeshighvaluehomeinsurancecover\">What Does High-Value Home Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Like a standard homeowners insurance policy, high-value home insurance has several types of coverages. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coverage A.</strong> This is also called <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>. A high-value home policy has dwelling coverage of $1million or more.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage B.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other structures coverage</a> helps pay for damage to structures on your property aside from the primary residence, such as fences and sheds.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage C.</strong> This is <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a>, and it can help cover the contents of your home in the event of a loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage D.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use coverage</a> often helps you pay for additional expenses if covered damage makes your residence temporarily uninhabitable.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage E.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> may pay claims if you’re responsible for someone else’s medical bills or property damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage F.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> typically helps pay your guest’s minor medical expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highvaluehomeinsuranceperks\">High-Value Home Insurance Perks</h2>\n<p>While the big difference between standard and high-value home insurance is the amount of dwelling coverage offered, high-value homeowners policy often include additional benefits. Not every insurance company includes all of these perks in their high-value home insurance, but knowing what might be available can help you compare policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moreextensivepropertycoverage\">More Extensive Property Coverage</h3>\n<p>Standard homeowners insurance policies typically cover your personal property like furniture and clothing. However, the amount of coverage available is often limited for specific types of property. Big ticket items like jewelry, art, furs, or guns, may require additional coverage through a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled property endorsement</a> that provides higher coverage limits for valuables.</p>\n<p>High-value home coverage, though, usually includes protection for expensive items. If you assume people with more expensive homes are more likely to have expensive possessions, it makes sense to include coverage for them in the policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"identitytheftcoverage\">Identity Theft Coverage</h3>\n<p>While identity theft coverage isn’t standard on all high-value home insurance policies, it’s not uncommon, either. This can be a nice supplement for those with a higher net worth because criminals have an incentive to steal their identities and benefit from their assets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cashbenefitsforextensivedamage\">Cash Benefits for Extensive Damage</h3>\n<p>As with any type of insurance, not all high-value policies are the same. But we’ve seen that some high-value policies offer cash benefits for extensive damage if the homeowner decides not to rebuild.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine your high-value home is more or less destroyed by fire. Your high-value policy would likely pay you enough money to build a home of a similar value on the same property. But if you decide you don’t want to do that – maybe because you’re afraid the area is too risky – some policies pay you in cash what rebuilding would have cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedshighvaluehomeinsurance\">Who Needs High-Value Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners whose homes are valued more than $1 million usually need high-value home insurance. However, you should note that we’re talking about your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>, not its <a href=\"/glossary/market-value-of-home/\">market value</a>. The replacement cost is the amount it would take to rebuild your home from the ground up and is the amount insurers use to calculate premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"warningmanyhighvaluehomesareunderinsured\">Warning: Many High-Value Homes Are Underinsured</h2>\n<p>One last thing to consider: <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">many homes are underinsured</a>, and that includes high-value ones. This is bad news because it means the owners of these homes stand to lose a lot in the event of damage. We described a lot of neat benefits in this post, but keep in mind that these benefits are generally only available to homeowners who are adequately insured for the value of their home and property.</p>\n<p>If your home is worth more than $1million, and you aren’t sure if you have the right policy, now may be a good time to shop for home insurance. Give us a call to discuss high-value homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This content was originally published in December 2018 and has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>"

    body: "<p>Holiday celebrations and festivities are part of what makes this season so merry. But claims are also common this time of year.</p>\n<p>Luckily, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can spread some cheer – it can cover many of the accidents and mishaps that abound around the holidays. Let’s take a look at some <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">common claims</a> so you can prepare for whatever the season has in store.</p>\n<p>These are some of the most common holiday claims and how to avoid them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1chestnutsroastingonanopenfire\">1. Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire</h2>\n<p>Whether you light candles for Hanukkah or roast chestnuts by the fireplace, house fires are common around the holidays. According to the most recent data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the culprits are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Christmas trees.</strong> These cause an average of 160 home fires and cause $10 million in direct property damage each year.</li>\n<li><strong>Holiday decor.</strong> Excluding Christmas trees, holiday decorations start 790 home structures fires per year for approximately $13 million in direct property damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Candles.</strong> Candle fires peak in December, causing 20 home fires each day on average.</li>\n<li><strong>Cooking.</strong> The start of the holiday season, Thanksgiving, is the peak day for home cooking fires, followed by Christmas Day and Christmas Eve.</li>\n<li><strong>Chimneys.</strong> The NFPA also notes that failing to clean heat sources like chimneys is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Top-causes-of-fire/Heating\">25 percent of heating-related fires</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only about <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">one in 365 insured homes have a fire and lightning claim</a>, but the losses are significantly more severe than other common claims, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The average fire and lightning claim costs $78,838.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance can cover fire damage, but prevent these accidents from the outset. Keep candles away from drapery and other flammable materials. Water your Christmas tree to prevent it from drying out and don’t overload any one circuit with strings of decorative lights.</p>\n<p>And never leave your fireplace unattended, especially while roasting chestnuts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2grandmagotrunoverbyareindeer\">2. Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer</h2>\n<p>Okay, hopefully it doesn’t come to that, but the holidays are a prime time for guest injuries, especially if Grandma has a little too much eggnog! If she falls down and gets hurt, she might need an ambulance ride to the hospital, and because it happened at your home, you could be on the hook for those medical expenses.</p>\n<p>An ambulance ride can be as much as <a href=\"https://health.costhelper.com/ambulance.html\">$1,200 or more plus mileage</a>. Fortunately, medical payments insurance – <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Coverage F</a> in your home insurance policy – can cover the cost of small, immediate medical expenses when these situations happen.</p>\n<p>To avoid these accidents, make sure rugs are tacked down and that handrails in and out of the home are sturdy. If anyone helps decorate the tree, spot them if they use a ladder. And lastly try to keep an eye on how much eggnog your guests imbibe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3onotannenbaum\">3. O No, Tannenbaum</h2>\n<p>Yards decorated with lights are a beloved <a href=\"/blog/holiday-traditions-to-try-this-year/\">holiday tradition</a>. Who doesn’t love driving around town at night to see who really got things shining? But those outdoor lights can lead to fires. While they’re often contained to a tree or shrub, it’s nice to know that your homeowners insurance policy can cover landscaping fire damage – generally up to $500.</p>\n<p>To avoid outdoor fires, make sure you are using lights designed for outdoor weather. Don’t lay lights on dead trees and make sure that all energy connections are kept out of the elements with the right housing boxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4hollyjollysewerbackups\">4. Holly Jolly Sewer Backups</h2>\n<p>Whether it’s extra feast grease being poured down the drain or too many guests using an older plumbing system, a backup of your sewer and drains can really put a damper on the holidays. This type of damage can be covered if you add <a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">water backup coverage</a> to your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>To avoid sewer backup claims, don’t send cooking grease down the drain – let it cool, solidify, and scrape it into a container that can be thrown away. Fix leaky toilets or faucets to reduce the strain on the household wastewater system. And before you have any major parties or holiday guests, consider getting your pipes snaked to clear them out before the fun begins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5stormyandnotsosilentnights\">5. Stormy and Not-So-Silent Nights</h2>\n<p>Wind and hail claims are the most common kind of home insurance claim, and they don’t slow down in winter. Winter storms bring snow, sleet, and heavy rains, the most raucous of which can damage your roof. Your homeowners policy should bring you some peace – it can cover wind, hail, and sleet damage.</p>\n<p>To prevent these claims, <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">keep your roof in good repair</a> so it’s ready to face the elements. Be sure to plow snow away from the house and downhill from your home to reduce the chance of melt snow flooding. And don’t forget to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy to protect against floods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6winterwonderlandinyourbasement\">6. Winter Wonderland…in Your Basement</h2>\n<p>Water damage claims from leaks or burst pipes are the second most common type of home insurance claim, costing an average of $11,098 per claim. Pipes can freeze because of a power outage or forgetting to leave on the thermostat at home during vacation. The water in the pipes freezes then expands, causing a leak.</p>\n<p>Home insurance can cover this type of water damage that originates inside the home, but only when you take the appropriate steps to prevent it. If you plan on going away for the holidays, turn your water off to prevent any potential problems and leave your thermostat on a setting that keeps your pipes from freezing.</p>\n<p>We hope your holidays are filled with joy and laughter, not losses and insurance claims. You’ve dealt with enough this year as is. Stay safe and have a happy and healthy holiday season!</p>"

    body: "<p>May your days be merry and bright – and may all your holidays be safe.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how holiday celebrations can bring extra risk into your life – and ways to minimize that risk to keep your home and family safe. We’ve also included a home holiday safety tips checklist at the end, so feel free to read ahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"holidaycookingriskssafetytips\">Holiday cooking risks &amp; safety tips</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/holiday-cooking.jpg?width=1000&name=holiday-cooking.jpg\" alt=\"Overhead shot of baker's wooden table with apples, flour, cinnamon, and walnuts, plus a whisk, rolling pin, and measuring spoons\" /></p>\n<p>Cooking is the leading cause of home fires in the United States, sparking an average of <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/oscooking.pdf\">172,900 fires per year</a> – nearly half of all fires that start in houses. Unsurprisingly, cooking-related fires spike on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>Fires are one of the <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">most common homeowner insurance claims</a>. To improve kitchen safety and prevent fires in your home this holiday season, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Never leave cooking food unattended.</strong> The most common cause of cooking fires is leaving the stove (or fryer) unattended.</li>\n<li><strong>Fry with care.</strong> Deep-fried turkeys have grown in popularity in recent years, but frying is much riskier than roasting (52% of home cooking fires are ignited by fat, grease, or oil). If you go the deep-fry route, read up on ways to <a href=\"/blog/avoid-turkey-fryer-fires/\">avoid turkey fryer fires</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Read food labels.</strong> Warning your guests (and avoiding known allergens) can prevent dangerous allergic reactions, so read ingredient lists for common allergens when you’re using new ingredients or cooking for a large group.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in a meat thermometer.</strong> Undercooked meat can cause food poisoning. If you’re cooking meat this holiday season – especially if it’s a large animal like a turkey – use a meat thermometer to ensure that it’s thoroughly cooked and safe to eat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"holidaycandleriskssafetytips\">Holiday candle risks &amp; safety tips</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/holiday-candle.jpg?width=1000&name=holiday-candle.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of a red holiday candle surrounded by holly and ivy\" /></p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that candles make a winter holiday night seem cozier and more inviting. And they’re part of many <a href=\"/blog/holiday-traditions-to-try-this-year/\">holiday traditions</a>: lighting candles is part of ritual celebrations of Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s no surprise, then, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christmas Day has almost <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/osCandles.pdf\">three times as many candle fires</a> as an average day.</li>\n<li>December is the peak month for candle fires, followed closely by January.</li>\n<li>12% of December candle fires start with holiday decorations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In December, candle fires started by decorations catching light are three times more common than during the rest of the year. And here’s another hint about why Christmas Day sees so many candle fires: 60% of candle fires start when something combustible (like discarded wrapping paper) is left too close to a candle.</p>\n<p>Every year, candles cause <strong>8,690 home fires</strong>. To keep from adding to that total, follow these <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/CandleSafetyTips.pdf\">candle safety tips</a> from the National Fire Protection Association:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use sturdy holders for lit candles.</strong> Holders that are too light or improperly weighted increase the chances of a lit candle toppling and igniting fuel nearby.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep lit candles on sturdy, clear surfaces.</strong> No wobbly tables. No tables with piles of paper. A clear, steady area ensures that the candle stands upright.</li>\n<li><strong>Blow candles out before they burn all the way down.</strong> This is especially important for candles in glass jars, which can explode if they get too hot (which can happen if a flame gets too low).</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t leave candles alone.</strong> As with cooking, don’t leave a burning candle unattended. And note that kids don’t count: never leave kids in a room alone with a burning candle.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t burn candles in rooms where people fall asleep.</strong> Sadly, 11% of candle fires sparked because someone fell asleep while the flame was burning.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave a clear 12 inches on every side of the flame.</strong> With plenty of clearance, it’s less likely that flammable material will blow into the flame or that the flame will catch something nearby on fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider fake candles.</strong> Flameless candle technology has come a long way in recent years. Many fake candles offer the same cozy, flickering light as the real thing – with none of the risk. (Bonus: scented candles cause allergic sinus reactions in some people, so going fake may help your guests breathe easier.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"winterweatherriskssafetytips\">Winter weather risks &amp; safety tips</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/winter-holiday.jpg?width=1000&name=winter-holiday.jpg\" alt=\"Two-story home with snow on the roof and in the yard\" /></p>\n<p>Some parts of the holiday season affect you whether or not you plan to celebrate - winter weather can cause both physical injury and property damage.</p>\n<p>Depending on where in the country you live, you can keep your property and your visitors safe by following these <a href=\"/blog/prep-your-home-for-winter/\">winter weather tips</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepare for bad weather.</strong> If you get snow and ice, stock up on salt and shovels ASAP. You’ll want to be prepared to keep your walkways clean before the first storm hits. Keeping the areas around your house walkable helps prevent slip-and-fall injuries.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your home’s seals.</strong> While home insurance covers <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">some types of water damage</a>, you still want to make it harder for water to creep into your house by keeping your gutters clean and sealing any cracks along windows, walls, and doors. When temperatures drop, even a little water in a crack can cause problems: as it freezes, it expands, which means more room for water to get inside and do damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your pipes.</strong> Freezing temperatures can also damage your pipes. Luckily, there are several ways to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-keep-pipes-from-freezing/\">keep pipes from freezing</a>, including insulation and heating tape.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean your chimney.</strong> If you have a fireplace or wood-burning stove, be sure to clean your chimney at least once per year. The buildup of substances like creosote (which can be removed with regular cleaning) contributes to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/osHeating.pdf\">25% of heating-related fires</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow other fire safety protocols.</strong> Keep your home fireplace or wood stove safe by clearing the area around it, and be sure to soak the hot ashes in water and store them in a metal container after you clean. Also, don’t burn cardboard or trash in your fireplace or wood stove.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep flammable objects away from heat sources.</strong> As with candles, keeping stuff at least three feet away from heat sources (including space heaters, which cause <strong>43% of home heating fires</strong>) can prevent fires.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way, you may want to <a href=\"/blog/louisiana-winter/\">prepare your home for winter</a> even when it's in the South.</p>\n<h2 id=\"christmastreeriskssafetytips\">Christmas tree risks &amp; safety tips</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/christmas-tree.jpg?width=1000&name=christmas-tree.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of a red Christmas ornament and lights on a Christmas tree\" /></p>\n<p>Christmas trees have gotten safer since the days when we used actual lit candles to decorate them, but they still cause about <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/osChristmasTrees.pdf\">160 home fires every year</a>.</p>\n<p>You can minimize the chances that your evergreen will go up in flames by following these Christmas tree safety tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay attention to your wires.</strong> Problems with electrical distribution or lighting equipment account for 34% of Christmas tree fires. If you’re not sure what counts as “too much,” read and follow the instructions on your lighting equipment and surge protector.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep trees away from heat sources.</strong> About a quarter of tree fires happen because the tree is too close to a heat source (fireplace, space heater, radiator, etc.). When you choose the perfect place for your tree, make sure it’s clear of things that get hot.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it watered.</strong> In the event of fire, a <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/a47306/why-water-your-christmas-tree/\">watered tree burns much slower</a> than a dry tree, which increases the odds that you’ll catch the fire and put it out before serious damage is done.</li>\n<li><strong>Get rid of it!</strong> While the majority of Christmas tree fires occur in December and January, a shocking <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/osChristmasTrees.pdf\">26% happen between February and November</a>, possibly because trees still lingering in February are dry and more flammable. Avoid this fate by getting rid of your tree by mid-January.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider going fake.</strong> Fires aren’t the only risk Christmas trees present: they also cause allergic reactions in many people. As with candles, artificial trees can reduce your fire risk and save the sinuses of some of your loved ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"holidaytravelriskssafetytips\">Holiday travel risks &amp; safety tips</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/holiday-travel.jpg?width=1000&name=holiday-travel.jpg\" alt=\"Image of two young girls dressed for winter sitting in the back of a hatchback loaded up with holiday presents\" /></p>\n<p>Whether you’re headed over the river and through the woods or up the turnpike to see family over the holidays, there are some risks to be mindful of.</p>\n<p>To increase the odds that your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-and-vacations/\">time away from your home</a> doesn’t lead to any unplanned problems, follow these holiday travel safety tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay calm.</strong> The Federal Aviation Administration says that it’s received over <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/data_research/passengers_cargo/unruly_passengers/\">2,100 reports of unruly passengers</a> so far this year and initiated over 760 investigations. Interfering with crew members violates federal law and can lead to fines and criminal charges, so you’d be wise to keep your head. And if others are losing theirs, try to stay out of it. If you can’t, use empathetic language to diffuse the situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a security system.</strong> Nobody wants to come home to a burgled house. Installing a security system – especially a <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-technology/\">smart system</a> that sends you real-time updates or alerts a central monitor – can help deter would-be thieves and ensure that any attempted burglary is addressed as soon as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Install smart sensors on your water pipes.</strong> These smart-home systems can prevent water damage by sensing unusual water activity (such as what would occur if a pipe froze and burst) and automatically shutting off your water when it happens. When you’re not around to turn off the water manually, a smart sensor can offer major benefits.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause your mail or have a neighbor collect it.</strong> Piled-up mail or newspapers can signal to thieves that nobody’s home, so consider pausing mail delivery for the days you’ll be gone (which you can do via the <a href=\"https://holdmail.usps.com/holdmail/\">USPS website</a>) or asking a neighbor to bring it inside every few days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hire a shoveling service, if necessary.</strong> If you live in an area where it snows a lot, consider hiring a shoveling service while you’re away. This ensures that you’ll be able to park when you get home and that you’re not signaling your awayness loud and clear to potential burglars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"generalhomesafetytipsfortheholidays\">General home safety tips for the Holidays</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/general-home.jpg?width=1000&name=general-home.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of a white room with a fireplace, Christmas tree, and other Christmas decorations\" /></p>\n<p>We’ve spent a lot of time on fire prevention here, and we’re not finished yet. The holidays come with several season-specific fire risks, but prevention isn’t something you should only be thinking about from Thanksgiving to New Year’s.</p>\n<p>Consider this: nearly <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Detection-and-Signaling/Smoke-Alarms-in-US-Home-Fires\">60% of the deaths caused by home fires</a> happen in houses that either didn’t have a smoke detector (41%) or had one that wasn’t working (16%). By either installing a smoke alarm or taking just a few seconds to test the one you have right now, you can help prevent damage and injury to everyone who visits your home.</p>\n<p>Here are some other holiday home safety tips for 2022 to keep your home and loved ones safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check your smoke detectors.</strong> Replace dead batteries and hook up disconnected batteries. (We really can’t say this enough.)</li>\n<li><strong>Choose flame-resistant or -retardant decorations.</strong> They can make a big difference in the event of a blaze.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose the right lights.</strong> Some lights are meant only for indoor use, some only for outdoor. Follow directions on the box.</li>\n<li><strong>Use clips, not nails, to secure lights.</strong> This prevents damage to the cords, which can spark fires.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask smokers to smoke outside.</strong> Provide them with a large, deep ashtray that’s not likely to overturn. Wet butts before discarding them. Ask smokers to keep their lighting equipment away from kids.</li>\n<li><strong>Use fireworks with care.</strong> While the Fourth of July is the biggest holiday for fireworks, plenty of people light displays for the New Year. Unfortunately, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Fireworks\">11,500 people</a> ended up seeking medical attention for injuries connected to fireworks in 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"holidayhomesafetytips2022checklist\">Holiday home safety tips 2022 checklist</h2>\n<p>Ready to have the safest holiday season of your life?

    body: "<p>The holidays will be here before we know it – and this year, they’re bound to be different because of the pandemic. On the bright side, it may be a perfect time to give a new holiday tradition a try – in addition to Zoom visits with family.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/thanksgiving-safety-tips/\">COVID-19</a> might keep us from traveling and hosting big gatherings, but that doesn't mean you'll have a blue Christmas. From getting crafty to virtually showing off your pipes, here are 12 new holiday traditions to keep the season merry and bright.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1createholidaydecorations\">1. Create holiday decorations</h2>\n<p>Whether you want to make your Christmas tree a record of your family’s biggest milestones or spruce up the house for the holidays, decor is a great way to bring the family together.</p>\n<p>For example, you might gather your household to make DIY ornaments, cut out paper snowflakes and craft a garland, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnNM8JlLDs\">make a paper dreidel</a>.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.mindfulmazing.com/\">Tina Williamson</a> suggests, “Think of something that means something special to your family this year.” If you rescued a dog, perhaps your newest family member could appear on the ornament you make.</p>\n<p>“Families can get together and hand sew their own Christmas stockings,” Trixi Symonds, founder at <a href=\"https://www.sewasoftie.com/\">Sew a Softie</a>, recommends. “This is a lovely opportunity for all the family to sit together to create, to chat, to share stories, and to bond.”</p>\n<p>“Years later, this will be a very cool reminder of some incredible family memories,” Williamson adds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2marvelatthechristmaslights\">2. Marvel at the Christmas lights</h2>\n<p>Gather up your household, grab some festive snacks (candy canes, anyone?), and hop in the car. Drive around the neighborhood and take in the holiday displays. Bonus points: queue up some holiday tunes as a soundtrack for the jaunt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3donatetoagoodcause\">3. Donate to a good cause</h2>\n<p>The holidays are the perfect time to donate to a worthy cause and create meaning beyond gifts. Share your plan with your family and decide on a charity to donate goods, money, or time to organize and maximize your impact.</p>\n<p>“The holiday season is a big time for giving and people are more likely to open their wallets,” says Jake Hill, CEO of <a href=\"https://debthammer.org/\">DebtHammer</a>. “So one of the things we do collectively is to choose an educational facility or rehabilitation center to sponsor for the year, then do a big donation drive in December to try and drum up as much support as possible.”</p>\n<p>Get your family involved in the process and ask them about charities or causes they want to support, then take a vote. Whether you donate nonperishable food to a local food bank, donate gently used clothing, contribute to a toy drive, or raise funds for your local animal shelter, you’ll feel great knowing you helped make the world a little brighter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4throwaholidaymoviemarathon\">4. Throw a holiday movie marathon</h2>\n<p>Maybe you usually watch <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</em> or <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em> this time of year. Whether you watch the classics for the millionth time or give <em>Happiest Season</em> a whirl, a holiday movie marathon can make you feel connected from a distance. You can add <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party-is-now-tele/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa\">Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party) to Chrome as an extension</a>, download the Houseparty app, or use Gaze to coordinate your virtual long-distance viewing sessions with your family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5doamysterygiftexchange\">5. Do a mystery gift exchange</h2>\n<p>If there was ever a year to try a mystery gift exchange with your family, this is it. <a href=\"/blog/household-budget-worksheet/\">More families are on a budget</a> and the holidays can really disrupt a year of otherwise careful saving, planning, and <a href=\"/blog/tricks-to-paying-off-credit-cards/\">paying down debt</a>.</p>\n<p>So instead of buying and mailing everyone gifts this year, each family member draws one name from a hat and keeps it a secret. That is the only person they’re responsible for getting a gift. Without juggling tens of names to buy gifts for, you can make sure the one gift is more substantial. Everyone gets a present they’ll be excited about, and your wallet can have a little more breathing room.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6giveadramaticholidayreading\">6. Give a dramatic holiday reading</h2>\n<p>Sad that you’re missing your nephew’s first Christmas? Send a Zoom or Google Meet invitation to your family and read a classic holiday story. Extra credit if you do a dramatic reading (like a different voice for each character!) and create some ambiance: stream a burning yule log in the background, hang some twinkling lights, and play some holiday tunes gently in the background. You can wear your best ugly sweater and pour some hot cocoa to top it all off. You’ll still miss snuggling your nephew (he’s growing so fast!), but the memory will be sugar-plum sweet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7haveaboardgametournament\">7. Have a board game tournament</h2>\n<p>Board games are a great way to bring the family together – and bring out their competitive side. Decide on a game that can be played tournament style, like chess, Jenga, Scrabble, etc., and get a bracket going. It will help keep your family engaged and give everyone something to do while indoors. Don’t forget to pick a prize for the winner!</p>\n<h2 id=\"8hostavirtualrecitalortalentshow\">8. Host a virtual recital or talent show</h2>\n<p>Instead of going out to holiday recitals and plays, bring the stage to your living room. The show, after all, must go on. Host an online recital or talent show and invite family and friends. It can be as extravagant as you want to be. For example, your cool aunt might recite her original poems, grandma might play the piano, and maybe you’ll show off your inner songbird and sing some carols.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://switchedoneducation.co.uk/\">Educator Clare Ford</a> gave this a try recently with her class who wrote and performed their own play. “Wherever their friends and families are in the world, they can enjoy a little Christmas magic from the comfort of their own home by coming to the virtual theater experience,” says Ford.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9trythe12daysofchristmas\">9. Try the 12 Days of Christmas</h2>\n<p>Hang up stockings and leave little treats in them each morning leading up to Christmas Day. These can be a couple pieces of chocolate, a candy cane, or even a small trinket. If you have children, they’ll be delighted by the surprise each day and it builds anticipation for the holiday. It’s also a way to make the month feel festive and special.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10startabookclub\">10. Start a book club</h2>\n<p>Pick a book for the whole family to read (or listen to) together. Bonus points if it’s holiday themed, but it can be anything your group agrees on. Gather around each night to read or listen to a bit of the book to build excitement for the holidays and give your family something to discuss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11inventanewholidaytreat\">11. Invent a new holiday treat</h2>\n<p>The holidays are a great time to try out new recipes – and give them your own personal twist. Gather your beloveds and head to the kitchen. Pick a treat to bake – whether it’s gingerbread cookies, truffles, a Swiss roll, or thumbprint cookies – and experiment to make it your family’s signature recipe. That could be as simple as adding extra chocolate chips to your cookies or throwing in a dash of cinnamon in your chocolate cake. If it’s a success, it can be something your family bakes together every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12haveacookiedecoratingcontest\">12. Have a cookie decorating contest</h2>\n<p>Dust off your trusted sugar cookie recipe and get ready to unleash your artistic side. Invite your household to decorate cookies and then have a contest to see who is the star baker in your pod. There are no losers in this game because everyone gets to enjoy the spoils.</p>\n<p>No matter how you choose to celebrate the holidays, be safe and be good to each other. We’re wishing you warmth and splendor!</p>"

    body: "<p>Whether you consider yourself jolly or grinchy, it’s important to know that the holiday season brings several unique risks that could affect the coverage in your homeowners insurance policy (or even lead to a claim). Here’s a look at four of those risks and how to keep your home protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1expensivepresentshintgetapersonalpropertyendorsement\">1. Expensive presents (Hint: Get a personal property endorsement!)</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance policy typically covers the stuff you own under what’s called <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C (personal property)</a>. But that coverage may exclude high-value items like fine jewelry, furs, art, and antiques.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning on giving (or end up receiving) a gift that’s on the more expensive side this holiday season, call your insurance provider to make sure it’s covered. What they’ll likely do is write an endorsement, which essentially means add some extra coverage, to ensure that the high-ticket item is protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2engagementrings\">2. Engagement rings</h2>\n<p>Ever heard of “<a href=\"https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-prepare-for-engagement-season\">Engagement Season</a>?” Turns out, it’s the same as the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Because of the spirit of gift-giving and the chance to be with families, engagements tend to cluster around the holidays. If you or someone in your household is likely to get engaged this holiday season, make sure you dial up your insurance provider to add the ring to your homeowner’s insurance policy. Otherwise, there’s a chance that it won’t be covered in the event of a disaster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3eggnog\">3. Eggnog</h2>\n<p>Here’s the deal: parties are a wonderful part of the holiday season, but if you’re hosting and serving alcohol, you may be exposing yourself to a lot of risk, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/social-host-liability\">social host liability</a>.</p>\n<p>Essentially, social host liability means that if someone drinks at your party and then hurts themselves or someone else (e.g., by driving home), you could be held liable for damages if they decide to sue.</p>\n<p>So if a drunk guest leaves your party, drives home, and hits a pedestrian, you could be partly liable for that pedestrian’s hospital bills, should they bring a lawsuit. That’s pretty scary, given how expensive hospital bills can be.</p>\n<p>But there are a few important qualifiers here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not every state has social host liability laws. (Check <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/social-host-liability-for-underage-drinking-statutes.aspx\">your state’s laws</a>.)</li>\n<li>Even in states without social host liability, though, you could be held liable for an injury that happens in your home (even if the injury happened in part because the injured person was intoxicated).</li>\n<li>It is illegal in every state to serve alcohol to those under 21. If you do that, you could face criminal charges (which would not be covered by your home insurance policy).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if you’re hosting a party where drinks will be served, do a little research. If your state does allow social host liability, check with your insurance provider to make sure you’re covered. Many homeowners policies offer this coverage as part of the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage (Part E)</a>.</p>\n<p>And remember, too, that it’s within your power to minimize your risk: you can hire a bartender to control who drinks what, encourage the use of designated drivers (or taxis and rideshares), serve food, and stop serving alcohol an hour or so before everyone leaves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4fires\">4. Fires</h2>\n<p>Fires are already one of the <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">most common homeowners insurance claims</a>. Now the National Fire Protection Association tells us the holidays are particularly busy for firefighters. For example, while candles account for <a href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/Fire-causes/Candles\">just 3% of house</a> fires per year, the four biggest days for candle-related fires are New Year’s Day, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and Christmas Eve.</p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/Fire-causes/Holiday\">top holiday fire triggers</a>? Christmas trees, lighting equipment, cooking, and decorations.</p>\n<p>Obviously, nobody wants their home to burn down. And <em>really</em> nobody wants it to happen over the holidays. So while your homeowner’s insurance policy almost certainly offers coverage for fire-related damage, be extra-alert as you deck the halls to make sure you and your loved ones are safe this holiday season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5theft\">5. Theft</h2>\n<p>Sometimes while the Whos are all down in Who-ville, there’s a Grinch back at home, plotting to plunder the presents from under the tree. In fact, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, incidents of robbery and personal larceny <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/understanding-the-reality-of-holiday-related-crimes-49947\">increase by roughly 20%</a> during the last month of the year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/theft-insurance-definition/\">Theft</a> at any time of year is likely to dampen the mood, it’s sure to sap your spirit around the holidays. You can reduce the chance of Christmas thieves visiting while you’re away by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing a <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-technology/\">smart home security system</a>.</li>\n<li>Pausing your mail delivery if you’re gone for more than a day.</li>\n<li>Setting timers so your lights go on as the sunsets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These and other steps may deter holiday heists, but they won’t necessarily keep criminals at bay. That’s why it’s so important to make sure you’re adequately covered, so anything damaged or stolen can be replaced.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in December 2017.

    body: "<p>Thinking of selling your home in the next few years? Tired of the neighbors’ rose bushes looking better than yours? Finally have some extra cash around to spend on your house and yard? Whatever your reasons for wanting to improve your home’s curb appeal, you’ll find your area’s spring home and garden show to be wildly helpful.</p>\n<p>Spring home and garden shows aren’t just an opportunity to drag your kids to the expo hall for a hot dog. These events are a great opportunity to take a look at how changes to your home and garden may look at scale. During these shows, expo halls often contain entire model homes, as well as new product launches, local service provider displays, and guest appearances by industry celebs.</p>\n<p>The internet is a wonderful resource for research, but it’s no substitute for seeing a whole wall of pre-stained cedar shingles on the side of a demo house. Until VR catches up with merchandisers’ wildest dreams, it can be hard to imagine how major cosmetic decisions will look unless they’re on display in front of you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyoushouldcareaboutcurbappeal\">Why you should care about curb appeal</h2>\n<p>Even if you don’t fall into one of the categories we mentioned above, it’s worth stopping to think about your home’s curb appeal.</p>\n<p>Simply put, “curb appeal” is how attractive your house and property look from the street. While interior changes that impact the day-to-day functionality of your home can be easy to weave into your home improvement plans, exterior edits often feel less urgent. But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t budget them in.</p>\n<p>Improving your home’s <a href=\"https://homeguides.sfgate.com/landscaping-increase-property-value-7301.html\">curb appeal increases its value</a>. Whether you’re considering listing your house for sale this summer or next year, spring is a great time to assess how your home looks from the street (and what you might do to give a better first impression). Even if you’re not planning to sell, there’s a benefit to making your house a place you love coming home to!</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/blog/spring-home-maintenance/\">spring home maintenance</a> efforts may unearth opportunities to increase your home’s curb appeal, but it can be hard to know where to begin. A home and garden show near you may be just the place to peruse your options.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Improving your home’s curb appeal increases its value​.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatsahomeandgardenshowanyway\">What’s a home and garden show, anyway?</h2>\n<p>Home and garden expos have been popping up around the country since the 1970s. In northern states where the building season is limited, these provide an opportunity for homeowners to see the latest trends and meet contractors in person. This “one-stop shop” opportunity to join a builder’s queue for the months ahead translates well across climes, and you can now <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/remodeling/homeshows.htm\">find a home and garden show</a> in almost every state.</p>\n<p>Show dates vary by region (as does the start of spring), but in general, home and remodeling shows are a great place to get ideas for summer landscaping, get deals on outdoor items, and chat with experts about everything from gardening to plumbing to decorating to buying or selling a home.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the basics of home and garden shows, then dig into five ways they can help you boost your home’s curb appeal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5thingstoknowbeforeyougotoahomeandgardenshow\">5 things to know before you go to a home and garden show</h2>\n<p>To locate the nearest home and garden show this weekend, do a quick internet search. The popularity of these events means that they’re available all across the country, and each is tailored to its region. Here’s what you need to know before heading to your local home and remodeling show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look for deals on admissions</strong>. Many shows, like the <a href=\"https://birminghamhomeshow.com/\">Birmingham Home Show</a>, offer discounted entry fees to those who subscribe to their email list. Some shows also offer gratis entrance to veterans and members of the <a href=\"https://www.redhatsociety.com/\">Red Hat Society</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Most shows charge between $5 and $10 for entry</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wear your walking shoes</strong>. Expo halls that host these events tend to be the biggest in town, so you should be prepared to do some walking.</li>\n<li><strong>Most events list their vendors</strong> and a map of the hall for you to peruse in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>You don’t have to be ready to buy</strong>. Making changes to your home – big or small – can be a challenge. If you enter the expo hall in the mindset of an explorer checking out new terrain, you’ll find the plethora of options less overwhelming. It may also help to write down a short list of things you’re looking to learn more about to help guide your visit (below, we offer a few questions to get you started, based on what you’re hoping to update at home).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you get to the home and garden show, there will plenty of ideas and visual displays to get your idea machine running. To help you focus your efforts on upping your curb appeal, consider these five approaches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1toupyourcurbappealgogreen\">1. To up your curb appeal, go green</h3>\n<p>The first rule of curb appeal is that you’ve got to take care of your yard. Especially if you’re looking to sell your home in the near term, you should consider improving the health of your lawn.</p>\n<p>If your lawn is wild and your neighbors keep theirs trim, you may be signaling to others that you have a poor or contentious relationship with those around you. This may be unappealing to homebuyers.</p>\n<p>Once your lawn is under control, consider adding landscaping. Functional landscaping that contributes to the amount of shade or establishes a border with neighboring properties can add value to your property. There are a few ways to achieve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plant a tree</strong>. <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">Trees</a> count as part of a landscaping effort, but they can be a separate decision altogether. Most kinds of large trees add shade to your home and interest to your yard. Alternatively a row of conifers may offer privacy. Whatever their purpose, be sure not to plant your new trees too close to your house or nearby power lines. It’s also important to be mindful of foliage and roots, as the latter may spread up to three times the crown's width. Roots that push against your foundation or burrow under a slab can cause serious structural issues down the line. You’ll want to consult experts on tree location as this depends on what kind of tree you’ve selected.</li>\n<li><strong>Plant a garden</strong>. Depending on where you live, which pests and local fauna you have to contend with, and your level of interest in growing your own food, a <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-nanny-or-gardener/\">garden</a> can be a great way to swap out unused space for productive land use. Raised-bed gardens with defined borders are a great way to add an impermanent feature to your yard.</li>\n<li><strong>Add flowers</strong>. Often less functional than delightful, a flowerbed can be a visually appealing barrier between sections of your yard. If you enjoy gardening and have the energy to replant your flowers every spring, annuals are a great choice for you. If you’d prefer a longer return on your investment, perennials may help you cut down on the amount of time spent laboring in the garden, as these come back every year, seeded by your last planting. It can be difficult to nurse plants through extreme weather, so a more sustainable alternative is to plant your flowers in pots or hanging planters so that you can move them into a semi-shaded porch or under cover in extreme rain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For advice on the best flora for your yard and region, be sure to ask the horticultural experts at the home and garden expo. They’ll want to know about your soil type, sun exposure, and water sources, so make sure you familiarize yourself with these aspects of your property before the event.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2cleanyourcurb\">2. Clean your curb</h3>\n<p>Did you hate raking as a child but see the necessity of leaf removal as an adult? It’s normal to feel hesitant to devote a Saturday morning to picking leaves out of your gutters, but these types of chores have the most immediate visual impact. To that end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clean your gutters</strong>. There are two great reasons to clean your gutters: it looks messy to have twigs and leaves sticking out of your roofline, and leaving debris up there can clog your gutters, increasing the potential for <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">costly water damage</a> or <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-roof-leaks/\">roof leaks</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wash your siding</strong>. Especially if you have mulch abutting your house, you may see dirt build up the sides of your house after the rainier winter months. If your siding is in good condition, consider <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/pressure_washer_equipment_rental\">renting a pressure washer</a> to freshen up your home’s exterior. It’s cheaper and less time consuming than repainting, and using this tool is straight-up fun.</li>\n<li><strong>Weed your walk</strong>. Grass and weeds fill the cracks between the stones, bricks, or concrete blocks that line your front walk. Over time, their encroachment can cause permanent damage. To save money, stay on top of your weeds. Lining your walk with gravel or small stones helps cut down on weed proliferation.</li>\n<li><strong>Trim your lawn’s edges</strong>. It may feel like the most complicated part of the lawn-grooming maneuver, but it’s worth your time. Keep the edges of your lawn clean and free of debris to make trimming an easy part of mowing your lawn. We recommend using a small push mower or weed wacker to groom the edges of your lawn before starting in on mowing the main green spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Home and garden shows offer many tools and tricks for lawn care. Take advantage of the experts on hand to ask them your questions about how to fend off weeds and which gloves will last season after season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3updateyourentrywaystomakeagoodfirstimpression\">3. Update your entryways to make a good first impression</h3>\n<p>Your entryways are the introduction to your dwelling. To make sure these give a strong first impression:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get a new door (or a fresh coat of paint)</strong>. Door fashions change like the racks at a retail store. There are regular shifts in the popularity of windows, peep holes, panels, and knobs. A door swap doesn’t have to break the bank, but it can offer a huge cosmetic lift.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your garage door</strong>. Like your front door, but bigger and easier to fold! The surface area your garage door covers is significant. It will make a major impact on how your house appears from the street. Don’t neglect it when you take out your paint brush.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your shutters</strong>. If you have shutters on your house, make sure they’re in good shape and securely fastened. If your shutters are askew or covered in chipped paint (or if a few panels have been lost to the winds of time), you should consider an update. If your window frames need a coat of paint, don’t hesitate to include them in this effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can’t test the weight of a door online, but you can at the expo hall. Ditto for getting a sense of whether that shade is <em>too</em> green for shutters. If you’re in the market for an upgrade to your exterior doors or windows, the home and garden show is a great time to gauge how these look in the real world and how easy they are to open and close.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4upgradethedetailsformaximumimpactfromthestreet\">4. Upgrade the details for maximum impact from the street</h3>\n<p>The devil is in the details, and there are many to consider when it comes to the exterior of your home. These three can help boost curb appeal without breaking the bank:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swap out your mailbox</strong>. This may sound like the last place where you’d think to spend a few dollars, but upgrading your mailbox can go a long way toward making your home look well-kept from the street.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your house numbers</strong>. Making your house number easy to read from the street is only one goal. It’s important to pick numbers that are visible without being jarring. Swap in a fresh set of digits to update the first impression your home gives.</li>\n<li><strong>Update hardware</strong>. If you don’t want to replace your entire door, consider changing the hardware. The <a href=\"https://learn.reeb.com/knowledge-base/anatomy-of-an-exterior-door/\">anatomy of an exterior door</a> is complex, and there are many small updates you can make beyond changing the style of the handle or knocker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s easy to overlook details from a distance, but home and garden show displays will help you visualize which special touches will be the most impactful from a dozen yards away.</p>\n<p>These events are also a great opportunity to find out whether the thing that looks best to you online looks as good in your hands. Plastic mailboxes are a great example of this: they may be lightweight and easy to install, but do they seem insubstantial in person? You’ll find out at the expo hall.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5considersymmetry\">5. Consider symmetry</h3>\n<p>Scientists agree that symmetry is appealing, and Instagram confirms it. Think carefully about what you want your yard to look like before you head out for an expo or start digging to plant a row of trees.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the front of your house is symmetrically designed, consider how these elements might add balance or symmetry when viewed from the curb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define (or redesign) a front path</strong>. This functional addition can add a lot of curb appeal. A <a href=\"https://www.gardenista.com/posts/hardscaping-101-front-paths/\">front path</a> shows the way you’ll enter your home every day. For a potential buyer, that narrative can hold a lot of appeal.</li>\n<li><strong>Light your landscaping</strong>. Many of us don’t think about lighting until the neighbors put up their annual winter light extravaganza (or until the bulb in the yard light burns out). But that doesn’t mean those are your only outdoor lighting opportunities. Lining your front path or uplighting the shrubbery is a great way to add visual appeal and keep sneaky vermin away.</li>\n<li><strong>Flower boxes</strong>. You don’t have to mount flower boxes to the side of your house to increase your curb appeal. Consider, for example, well-placed flower boxes on the edge of your porch. Movable boxes of flowers or seasonal plants (try cut boughs of evergreens in winter) can contribute to the symmetry of your design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find the latest trends in yard design at the expo hall wherever the gardening exhibits are located. It’s a good idea to bring along a printout or drawing of your plans to discuss with design experts onsite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"curbappealisaboutcohesion\">Curb Appeal Is about Cohesion</h2>\n<p>There are many ways to add curb appeal to your home, but if you’re stumped for ideas and there’s no home and garden show this weekend on your local calendar, you can always walk around the block to check out what your neighbors are up to.</p>\n<p>What makes for strong <a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/what-is-curb-appeal/\">curb appeal varies by region</a>. While this guide points to some opportunities to update your front yard, the style and materials you choose are entirely up to you (and your local climate). While it may be wise to think about a future in which you may want to sell your house, you should ultimately design the home you want to return to every day.</p>"

    body: "<p>Does homeowners insurance cover power outages? Like most questions about insurance, the answer is not a straightforward yes or no. Instead, coverage usually depends on your policy terms and the circumstances of the power outage.</p>\n<p>That may be less than reassuring to many homeowners this summer. According to the National Weather Service's <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/NERC_SRA_2022.pdf\">Outlook for Summer 2022</a> from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation says several regions will likely see more energy emergencies than usual.</p>\n<p>Rather than staying in the dark about <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> and power outages, let’s take a high-level look at what policies typically cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpoweroutages\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Power Outages?</h2>\n<p>Whether or not a home insurance policy covers a power outage usually depends on the cause and the location. For example, power outages that are located on your property and caused by events that are included under your policy, like windstorms or lightning strikes, are often covered.</p>\n<p>But let’s say a lightning strike at your local utility company causes a blackout over a wide area that includes your house. In that case, the source of the power outage is not on your property, and that often means your home insurance doesn’t cover it.</p>\n<p>The same is generally true of power outages caused by perils not covered by your home insurance, like flooding. If a flood causes a power outage, you may only have a claim if you carry <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverspoiledfoodfromapoweroutage\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Spoiled Food from a Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>When a power outage is caused by a covered peril, you may have limited coverage for spoiled food. So if a tree on your property knocks out your power lines, you might be compensated for the items in your refrigerator that go bad. However, this isn’t true in other situations, such as a power outages caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planned rolling brownouts.</li>\n<li>Your service being cut off for nonpayment.</li>\n<li>A failure of the electrical grid.</li>\n<li>Excluded events, such as earthquakes, flood, and normal wear and tear.</li>\n<li>Malfunctioning or poorly installed equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most insurance companies limit the amount of coverage they offer for spoiled, usually to around $500, plus you may be responsible for a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. On the other hand, you may be able to get reimbursement for your spoiled food by contacting your power company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverhotelstaysduringpoweroutage\">Does Home Insurance Cover Hotel Stays During Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>A power outage seldom triggers your homeowners policy’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>. Also called Coverage D, loss of use coverage pays a portion of your additional living expenses when your home is made uninhabitable by a covered peril. This can include a hotel room so that you have a safe place to stay. While it may be uncomfortable, your home is usually considered habitable during a blackout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areelectronicscoveredwhendamagedbyapoweroutage\">Are Electronics Covered When Damaged by a Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>As with some of our other examples, you may be able to file an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a> for your electronics if they’re damaged by a power outage that’s caused by a covered peril. Imagine for instance, that a lightning strike causes a <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a> that results in a blackout. Power surges can easily damage computers, televisions, and other plugged-in electronics, but you may be able to repair or replace them because lightning strikes are a covered peril.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverfrozenpipesifmypowergoesout\">Does Home Insurance Cover Frozen Pipes If My Power Goes Out?</h2>\n<p>Granted, we’re focusing on hot weather, but extreme temperatures in the winter can also cause power outages. When that happens, it’s not uncommon for your pipes to freeze. This can lead to your pipes bursting.</p>\n<p>In many instances, the water damage that follows is often covered by home insurance. However, your claim may be denied if your pipes were in poor condition, either because of wear and tear or inadequate maintenance.</p>\n<p>Having quality insurance and knowing what it covers is just the first step in protecting your home. The next is making sure you’re ready for the worst-case scenario – including <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prep-for-a-power-outage/\">preparing for power outages</a> in your home.</p>"

    body: "<p>Learn how your homeowners insurance protects you on vacation – and why it's important that it does.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeyourhomeinsuranceonvacation\">Take your home insurance on vacation</h2>\n<p>Hitting the road this <a href=\"/blog/is-your-homeowners-policy-ready-for-summer/\">summer</a> for some R&amp;R? If so, we’ve got some good news for you: your homeowners insurance policy may continue to protect you while you’re on the road.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at which parts of your policy you can expect to join you on vacation and how you might want to supplement the gaps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personalliability\">Personal liability</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> portion of your homeowners insurance covers you if your actions cause physical injury or property damage to someone else. But what many homeowners may not realize is that liability protection usually follows the homeowner. So if you’re at a friend’s house and knock over a thousand-dollar vase while reenacting your horseshoe throw, your policy may cover the cost to replace it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you’re renting a beach house with your family and cause damage there, your personal liability coverage may offer protection. Keep in mind, though, that every policy is a little different. If you’re curious about the limits of your policy, read the fine print or talk to your agent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"medicalexpensescoverage\">Medical expenses coverage</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expenses coverage</a> can pay the costs if someone is injured on your property and requires immediate medical treatment. Its limits are typically much lower than personal liability limits – usually just a few thousand dollars. The goal of this particular coverage is to ensure injured parties get treatment when they need it so they don’t sue you down the line.</p>\n<p>Like personal liability coverage, this portion of your homeowners insurance may follow you as you travel. Your policy may outline coverage for “injuries sustained by a third party either on or off the insured’s premises,” which means that those injuries could be at your house or somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Again, the details depend on the language in your policy. Check to see whether you’re protected on the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"propertydamage\">Property damage</h2>\n<p>More good news: the portion of your homeowners insurance that protects your stuff (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a>) often applies whether you’re at home or on vacation. In other words, if a thief runs off with your luggage while you’re sleeping one night (which we sincerely hope doesn’t happen), your home insurance may be able to replace the clothes, shoes, and other ordinary possessions that were inside.</p>\n<p>Check your policy for details about potential limits of coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fillthegapswithtravelinsurance\">Fill the gaps with travel insurance</h2>\n<p>While homeowners insurance can offer you some protection while you’re on vacation, it won’t protect your investment in the vacation itself or compensate you when certain things that might go wrong. For example, the medical expenses portion of your homeowners policy will NOT pay out if you or another member of your family gets sick or injured on vacation.</p>\n<p>For that kind of protection, you may want to consider travel insurance, which can offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medical and dental expense coverage.</strong> Some travel insurance policies include coverage for emergency medical treatments you need while on vacation.</li>\n<li><strong>Reimbursement for canceled trips.</strong> A lot of travel expenses (flights, hotels, rented cars, tour costs, etc.) are non-refundable. Travel insurance policies, though, can reimburse you if you’re forced to cancel at the last minute.</li>\n<li><strong>Partial reimbursement for shortened trips.</strong> If bad weather forces you to head home early, travel insurance may offer compensation for the part of the vacation you were forced to miss.</li>\n<li><strong>Baggage protection.</strong> Damaged, lost, or stolen luggage can ruin an otherwise successful trip – but with travel insurance, you can at least receive money to replace whatever you need to.</li>\n<li><strong>24-hour assistance.</strong> Some policies even offer a hotline you can call for guidance if something goes wrong. This can be handy if you have spotty internet, don’t speak the local language, or need to know which medical facility has the best reputation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vacations are all about taking time away from the worries of ordinary life. Homeowners insurance can help keep you and your stuff safe while you travel (but if you want greater protection on the road, don’t forget about travel insurance).</p>"

That includes things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">Water damage</a> from burst pipes and appliances.</li>\n<li>Liability.</li>\n<li>House fires.</li>\n<li>Theft.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">Dog bites</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2yourinsurercoverstoomanyhomesinyourarea\">2. Your Insurer Covers Too Many Homes in Your Area</h3>\n<p>If an insurance company already insures too many homes in your area, it may increase rates to decrease its concentration. Again, spreading out risk helps make sure the company can meet its claims obligations if a widespread disaster strikes and keep prices affordable for homeowners.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3yourcompanypaidoutalotofclaims\">3. Your Company Paid Out a Lot of Claims</h3>\n<p>Insurance uses the law of large numbers to spread risk over many homes and keep the costs down. But when a carrier experiences a year with higher than expected claims, it has to adjust premiums to cover losses and operating costs. For example, if a hurricane hit your community last year, you can probably expect higher rates this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4inflation\">4. Inflation</h3>\n<p>Your insurance rates may increase if your limits were adjusted to account for inflation and the cost of rebuilding your home. The national <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/244983/projected-inflation-rate-in-the-united-states/\">2019 rate of inflation</a> was 1.81 percent, but your home may see higher or lower rates depending on the construction costs in your area. The more it costs to rebuild your home, the more your insurance will be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5youlostdiscounts\">5. You Lost Discounts</h3>\n<p>Read through your renewed homeowners policy and look for any discounts that might not have been applied. If you didn’t submit proof of safety devices, these discounts may be removed and make your rates go up. That’s easy enough to correct – just contact your provider and submit the discount documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6youaddedatrampolineorswimmingpool\">6. You Added a Trampoline or Swimming Pool</h3>\n<p>In the industry, we lovingly call these “attractive nuisances” – the items in your yard that may attract visitors and cause injuries. Think: swing sets, tree houses, trampolines, <a href=\"/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">swimming pools</a>, and slides. They may even invite trespassers, and unfortunately, you can be held responsible for injuries even your uninvited guests experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7youmadesomebighomeimprovements\">7. You Made Some Big Home Improvements</h3>\n<p>Home improvements increase the value of your home, and they also increase how much it would cost to rebuild your home. As you might’ve guessed, that can make premiums go up. That’s especially true if the improvements add square footage or substantially increase the quality of a room, like if you upgrade from particle board cabinets to custom cherrywood cabinets. That’s a big difference in the cost to replace them if you have a claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8youhaveoutdatedelectricalplumbingandhvacsystems\">8. You Have Outdated Electrical, Plumbing, and HVAC Systems</h3>\n<p>If you have an older home, outdated systems can make it more expensive to insure (or <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">hard to insure</a> altogether). Investing in electrical, HVAC, or plumbing upgrades can not only make your home safer, but they may make your homeowners insurance more affordable in the long run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9yourroofisgettingold\">9. Your Roof Is Getting Old</h3>\n<p>Your roof protects everything under it. As it gets older, it doesn’t do that job as well. An older roof is more likely to have leaks and experience wind and hurricane damage. It may be time to replace your roof if it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3-tab or asphalt shingles and is older than 15 years.</li>\n<li>Architectural shingles and is older than 20 years.</li>\n<li>Clay tiles, concrete tiles, slate, or metal and is older than 40 years.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">flat or shed shape</a> and is older than 10 years.</li>\n<li>Wood shake or shingles or asbestos materials.</li>\n<li>Existing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"10yourcreditscoredropped\">10. Your Credit Score Dropped</h3>\n<p>Many states (like Florida) allow insurers to use your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">credit score to help determine your rates</a>. The better your credit is, the lower your premiums will be. If your credit rating drops, your insurance premium may go up. The good news is that you can raise your score by paying your bills on time and reducing your credit card balance (aim for 30 percent utilization!).</p>\n<h3 id=\"11youadoptedadog\">11. You Adopted a Dog</h3>\n<p>All dogs are good dogs, but some are <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breeds</a>. If you have a German shepherd, for example, your rates may increase to cover potential bite claims, and those aren’t cheap. Overall, home insurance companies paid nearly <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/insuranceindustryblog/dog-related-injury-claims-nearly-900-million-in-2021/\">$900 million in dog bite claims</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>It can be frustrating to see a slightly higher rate when your policy is up for renewal, but remember: all companies increase prices slightly each year. If you decide to shop around for a new policy, just make sure you’re not sacrificing coverage for a slightly lower price.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you have a little help around the house, it's important to know how insurance applies to your household employees.</p>\n<p>While most of us can only dream about household employees of the kind (and number) that kept Downton Abbey running, a lot of us do pay people to work at our homes. For example, if you have a nanny, regular babysitter, gardener, landscaper, or another professional who works in or on your house, you may have “household employees.”</p>\n<p>You probably already know that this matters when it comes time to do taxes. We’re here to tell you that it could also affect your insurance needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisadomesticworker\">What is a domestic worker?</h2>\n<p>Household employees, often called domestic workers, are people hired to perform tasks around your home. Common examples of domestic workers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nannies.</li>\n<li>Cleaning people.</li>\n<li>Yard workers.</li>\n<li>Handymen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, household employees may work for an agency. But many homeowners hire help, making them the domestic worker’s employer. That’s an important distinction to understand when it comes to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whypersonalliabilitymedicalexpensesinsurancedontcoveryournannyorgardener\">Why personal liability &amp; medical expenses insurance don’t cover your nanny or gardener</h2>\n<p>If you’re familiar with the details of your homeowners insurance policy (or a follower of this blog), you know that the standard homeowners policy includes two types of coverage that can pay for injuries that happen to your guests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability insurance</a> can cover the cost of a lawsuit if an injured guest decides to sue you because they think your negligence caused their injury.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> can pay the immediate medical costs associated with treating an injury (like an ambulance ride).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But here’s the kicker: household employees are NOT considered “guests.” If your nanny or gardener is injured at your home and you try to make a claim on your home insurance policy, there’s a good chance that that claim will be denied – meaning you’d be on the hook for all the costs.</p>\n<p>So if you have a nanny, a babysitter who works consistent hours, or any other employee you hired directly (not through an agency), you may be required to get additional insurance to cover them while they’re working at your house.</p>\n<p>This coverage is called workers’ compensation insurance. It works like a combination of personal liability and medical expenses coverage, but for employees who are injured on the job. While it’s designed to ensure that employees who are hurt at work don’t have to struggle to pay their medical bills or rehabilitation expenses, it also incentivizes employers to create a safe work environment.</p>\n<p>Nearly every state requires employers to provide workers’ compensation insurance under certain circumstances. While some states (including Georgia) specifically lift this requirement for household employees, others (like California) explicitly require the coverage for households that employ nannies or long-term babysitters. Regardless of the law, though, experts often recommend carrying workers’ comp anyway to ensure you have access to funds in the event of an injury.</p>\n<p>To figure out what you’re required to carry, take a look at this <a href=\"https://injury.findlaw.com/workers-compensation/workers-compensation-laws-by-state.html\">state-by-state breakdown of workers’ comp laws</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidneedingworkerscompensationinsuranceforyournanny\">How to avoid needing workers’ compensation insurance for your nanny</h2>\n<p>We mentioned above that you may need insurance for household employees if you hire them independently. If you’re not keen on the idea of securing yet another insurance policy, consider hiring workers through an agency that provides this insurance.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of working with agencies is that they often offer background checks, reference checks, and other services that can make your life easier (and give you peace of mind before welcoming someone into your home to work).</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepinghouseholdemployeessafe\">Keeping household employees safe</h2>\n<p>Whether you hire a domestic worker through an agency or not, you want to minimize their risk for injury as best you can. Here are some tips to help keep your household employees safe on the job:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tack down rugs.</strong> Avoid slip-and-falls by making sure your area rugs aren’t slipping or curling.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your stair railings.</strong> Loose or poorly maintained railings can collapse and cause a dangerous fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Promote safe work habits.</strong> This often means supplying your household employees with the right equipment, like a dolly for lifting heavy items.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reducing the chance for accidents around your home is a good idea no matter what your situation is.

    body: "<p>Despite your best efforts, you can’t always prevent a roof from letting water leak into your home. This can be both annoying and destructive with items in your home getting damaged. Getting the problem taken care of as soon as possible is paramount to preventing further damage.</p>\n<p>But that raises an important question: Does home insurance cover roof leaks? The answer, as it is with most insurance questions, depends on your particular situation and policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeinsurancehandlesaleakingroof\">How Home Insurance Handles a Leaking Roof</h2>\n<p>Let’s break down four common roof leakage scenarios and how your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> may respond in each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario1roofleakcausedbyacoveredperil\">Scenario 1: Roof Leak Caused by a Covered Peril</h3>\n<p>In this scenario, “<a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>” causes your roof to leak. That just means that the event that created the roof leak is already covered by your insurance policy. An <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>, for example, is an open perils policy, so it covers damage from most events, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning strikes</li>\n<li>Falling objects (like trees)</li>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Wind</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, sleet, or snow</li>\n<li>Impact from a land or air vehicle (like a falling plane fragment)</li>\n<li>Theft or vandalism</li>\n<li>Riots</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of the above caused your roof leak, there’s a good chance your insurance may pay to repair the leak itself. Assuming you notice the leak quickly and inform your insurance company right away, your policy may also pay for secondhand damage the leak caused (e.g., water damage to personal possessions).</p>\n<p>There is a big “however” here: if you don’t notice the leak for several months after it happens, there’s a chance your policy will only pay to repair the roof damage itself and not any additional damage caused by water or creatures the leak lets inside. More on that below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario2roofleakcausedbypoormaintenance\">Scenario 2: Roof Leak Caused by Poor Maintenance</h3>\n<p>We’ve mentioned before that homeowners policies usually don’t cover <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">wear and tear</a>. The same goes for damage that could have been prevented by regular maintenance.</p>\n<p>So if your roof’s leaking because you neglected to update it, clear the gutters or otherwise do basic home maintenance, your insurance company may deny your claim and refuse to pay for repairs.</p>\n<p>That’s because it’s your job as a homeowner to take care of your house. The insurance company is only on the hook when unexpected and acute events cause damage.</p>\n<p>This is also why you may not be reimbursed for all the related damage if you didn’t notice a leak for several months. Someone who maintains their home to reasonable standards would likely notice a roof leak before the water damage escalated.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a broad overview. Every individual circumstance is different. It is possible that there’s a perfectly legitimate reason you didn’t notice a roof leak for some time after it happened.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario3roofleakcausedbyanoncoveredperil\">Scenario 3: Roof Leak Caused by a Non-Covered Peril</h3>\n<p>As you may have guessed by the word “non-covered,” a leak caused by an event your homeowners insurance doesn’t cover likely won’t lead to a claim payout. The following events aren’t covered in most home insurance policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n<li>Floods</li>\n<li>Wear and tear</li>\n<li>Lack of regular and proper maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of the above caused a roof leak, you may have to pay for repairs out of pocket.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario4roofleakcausedbypoorworkmanship\">Scenario 4: Roof Leak Caused by Poor Workmanship</h3>\n<p>So what happens if you’re a diligent homeowner and <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">replace your roof</a> on schedule, but it springs a leak because the roofing contractor you hired did a substandard job?</p>\n<p>This can be really frustrating, not least because new roofs aren’t cheap. The bad news is that your homeowners insurance most likely doesn’t cover a leak caused by shoddy workmanship. But that doesn’t mean you’re without options. In that scenario, you may be able to make a claim on the roofer’s insurance policy.</p>\n<p>This is why it’s so important to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hire a good contractor</a>. In most cases, you’ll want to make sure the roofer you hire has an active liability insurance policy. That policy should offer payment for property damage caused by the roofer’s work (like a leak to your roof and subsequent damage to your home).</p>\n<p>To verify coverage, ask to see a certificate of insurance before you sign a contract. When you do, check to make sure the policy expiration date is sometime after the end of the work they’ll be doing on your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtospotaroofleak\">How to Spot a Roof Leak</h2>\n<p>Spotting a leak early can help prevent a lot of the damage that water can cause inside your home. Some signs of a potential roof leak include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing, damaged, or warped shingles.</li>\n<li>Water stains on your ceiling or the underside of your roof.</li>\n<li>Damaged insulation or mold in your attic.</li>\n<li>Discolored exterior walls<strong>.</strong></li>\n<li>Bulges on interior walls.</li>\n<li>Musty odors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourroofisleaking\">What to Do If Your Roof Is Leaking</h2>\n<p>A leaky roof needs to be taken care of as quickly as possible to minimize damage. The first step is to move your personal property like beds, rugs, and furniture out of the way. Next, grab buckets or trash cans to catch water and protect your floors. You may also find that you need to poke small holes in your ceiling if you see it sagging under the weight of collected water.</p>\n<p>Another way to protect your home is to tarp your roof to prevent water from getting inside. Only take this step if you can do so safely. You can also hire a professional roofer to tarp your roof. That may be your best bet considering you will also want to schedule repairs.</p>\n<p>Lastly, be sure to document the leak and the damage it caused for your insurance company. Photos or video recording can help your <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> assess the situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofileaclaimforaroofleak\">How to File a Claim for a Roof Leak</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve mitigated your damages, you need to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a> with your insurer. Most insurance companies offer several ways to do this. For instance, our members can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim online</a>.</li>\n<li>Call <a href=\"tel:866-204-2219\">886-204-2219</a>.</li>\n<li>Email <a href=\"mailto:claims@kin.com\">claims@kin.com</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can usually find your policy with just your address, but other insurance providers may need your policy number. You may also want to have any photos of the damage handy. If your roof is leaking when you call, our representative can help you with emergency services. You’ll work with a claims specialist who can inspect your damage and explain the available coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stillhavequestionsaboutyourroof\">Still Have Questions about Your Roof?</h2>\n<p>Check out our other roof-related blog posts: <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof\">What’s in a Roof?</a> and <a href=\"/blog/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-florida-wind-mitigation/\">The Nuts and Bolts of Florida Wind Mitigation</a>.

    body: "<p>Your insurance score is different than a credit score. Learn about it here.</p>\n<p>While most folks have at least heard of credit scores, insurance scores may be a mystery. Essentially, your home insurance score can impact how much you pay for your coverage, depending on where you live. Most states allow insurance carriers to factor this a credit-based insurance score into policy pricing. Let’s take a closer look at what this score is and how insurers determine it. You’ll also pick up some tips on improving your insurance score, which can help you <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">save money on home insurance</a> in some cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomeinsurancescore\">What is a home insurance score?</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance score is number that represents how likely you are to file a claim on your policy. Essentially, your insurance company assigns a value to certain details from your credit history, runs them through an algorithm, and calculates your score. Because the calculation includes credit information, your score is sometimes called a credit-based insurance score.</p>\n<p>While both your credit and insurance scores are calculated using many of the same variables, they serve different purposes. Lenders use credit scores to decide if they should lend you money. A good credit score tells them you’re financially responsible individual who will most likely pay off the debt. That information is valuable to insurers, too, but they also want to figure out how much you might cost them over time. Claims cost insurance companies money, and studies have shown people with high credit scores tend to file fewer claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancescoresvscreditscores\">Home insurance scores vs credit scores</h2>\n<p>A credit score is a three-digit number designed to predict the likelihood that you will or won't be able to pay back your credit obligations 24 months following the scoring. Your credit score is based on factors like your debt, payment history, number of available credit lines, and the length of your credit history.</p>\n<p>An insurance score takes those credit factors into account, too, but it also considers your insurance claim history, your home's safety features, <a href=\"/glossary/protection-class/\">fire protection class</a>, and more. It varies depending on the insurance company.</p>\n<p>Your credit report plays a key role in your insurance score. To give you an idea of what matters most to your score, take a look at how FICO weighs different credit factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Late or missed payments are 35 percent of your score.</li>\n<li>Available credit is 30 percent.</li>\n<li>Depth and length of credit history is 15 percent.</li>\n<li>Total number of accounts makes up 10 percent.</li>\n<li>Hard inquiries are 10 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's also worth noting that credit-based insurance scores are governed by the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act\">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a>, which means insurance providers can’t consider the following when calculating your score:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Race</li>\n<li>Ethnicity</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Marital status</li>\n<li>Nationality</li>\n<li>Religion</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"doescheckingyourinsurancescoreimpactyourcreditscore\">Does checking your insurance score impact your credit score?</h2>\n<p>While some insurance companies do a hard credit inquiry (i.e., a hard pull) to calculate your insurance score – which does impact your credit score – Kin only does a soft credit inquiry, which doesn't.</p>\n<p>Hard inquiries are usually used for new lines of credit, mortgage and auto loan applications, student loan applications, and apartment rentals. These can stay on your credit report for up to two years. Too many hard inquiries in a short amount of time can bring down your credit score.</p>\n<p>Soft inquiries don't stay on your credit report. These are usually used for things like checking your credit score, pre-qualified credit card offers, pre-qualified insurance quotes, and for employment verification.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoimproveyourhomeinsurancescore\">How to improve your home insurance score</h2>\n<p>Home insurance scores typically fall between 200 and 997. A score of 770 or above is considered good and usually means insurers can offer better rates and discounts when they are allowed to factor in a credit-based insurance score. Anything below 500 means you have some work to do.</p>\n<p>First, you can improve your credit score by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying bills on time.</li>\n<li>Keeping your balance low on your credit cards.</li>\n<li>Reducing your overall debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might even consider going to a credit counselor to get on track.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may want to shop around. Different carriers sometimes offer better rates, so compare policy terms and premiums before you <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buy home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodisputenegativeentriesonyourcreditreport\">How to dispute negative entries on your credit report</h2>\n<p>Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it's your right as a consumer to dispute any inaccurate information. The act details what information your credit report can show and how long that information can stay on your report (typically about seven years).</p>\n<p>It's easiest to report a dispute either online or via mail to the credit bureau who provided the credit report. To make a dispute, you'll need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A recent copy of your credit report.</li>\n<li>A description of the inaccurate information on your report.</li>\n<li>Copies of proof to support your case.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The credit bureau will cross reference your dispute with the business that reported the error. If the credit bureau confirms that the information was reported in error, they'll remove the entry.</p>\n<p>For your reference, here's the contact information for most credit bureaus:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.consumerdisclosure.com/\"><strong>LexisNexis Consumer Center</strong></a></p>\n<p>P.O.

    body: "<p>Hosting a Super Bowl party is a great way to spend a cold Sunday in February. But just like your favorite team may face injuries during the big game, bringing people to your home can open you up to all kinds of risks. Before you break out the smoker, you should know how home insurance has your back on Sunday so you can enjoy the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"superbowlsundayrisksforhomeowners\">Super Bowl Sunday risks for homeowners</h2>\n<p>On February 12, millions of Americans will gather to watch the Super Bowl – most of us in our homes or the home of a friend. If you haven’t thought beyond what kind of sauce you’re making for your wings, it’s time to take a few minutes to understand how your homeowners liability insurance can come into play to keep you safe.</p>\n<p>First, a quick note on what we mean by home liability insurance. Most people think of their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> as something they’ll need if a tree falls through the roof. That’s not incorrect, but in addition to providing coverage for repairing or replacing damaged property, most homeowners insurance also offers liability coverage. This part of your policy (also called personal liability or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Coverage E</a>) can pay for repairs and even legal expenses if someone accidentally gets hurt on your property.</p>\n<p>Separate from personal liability coverage, most homeowners’ insurance policies also include medical payments coverage (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Coverage F</a>) for when your backyard halftime game gets a little too rough. Coverage F helps mitigate your liability by getting injuries taken care of quickly so they don’t get worse or lead to litigation.</p>\n<p>Obviously, you hope you never need Coverage F – or Coverages A through E for that matter – but it’s good to know it’s there if your Super Bowl Sunday takes a bad turn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersliabilityrisksataparty\">Homeowners liability risks at a party</h2>\n<p>If things go according to plan, you’ll never need to use your home liability coverage. But coverage is a must-have just in case things do go wrong. Liability claims tend to be <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">expensive</a>, and can often lead to lawsuits if not handled properly. Here are a few incidents that might lead to a claim on this part of your policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Food poisoning or allergic reactions</strong>: It’s not always clear where allergens lurk at a potluck, but allergic reactions can be serious. If someone at your party gets sick from the food you serve, they could sue you to cover the cost of their medical bills (after all, a single ambulance ride can cost <a href=\"http://health.costhelper.com/ambulance.html\">more than a thousand dollars</a>). Luckily, your personal liability coverage will likely cover the costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Damage to guests’ property</strong>: Rowdy kids, intoxicated guests, and excited animals can mean things get knocked over or spilled on at Super Bowl parties. That’s usually no big deal – but what happens if the speaker system your neighbor loaned you for the big game is ruined at your party? Again, your home liability insurance may be able to pay to have the property repaired or replaced.</li>\n<li><strong>Dog bites</strong>: Speaking of excited animals, it’s not always clear how Rover will react to a crowd. If your furry friend bites a guest, insist they get whatever medical care they need. Your homeowners liability insurance should cover the costs, unless you have a breed that’s excluded by your insurance provider. (But either way: make sure your guest gets treated!)</li>\n<li><strong>Alcohol-related injuries</strong>: Drinking can make a Super Bowl party more festive. But it can also lead to potentially serious injuries caused by alcohol-fueled fights, trips and falls, and even impaired driving. As a host, it’s important to understand that some states allow social hosts to be <a href=\"http://injury.findlaw.com/accident-injury-law/social-host-liability.html\">held liable for alcohol-related injuries</a> that happen after people drink at their homes. This is a serious matter, as drunk driving can cause serious injury and death. The liability can be tremendous (meaning expensive). Your best bet here is to encourage safe behavior: make it difficult to drink to excess, encourage the use of designated drivers, and call a ride (or offer a place to crash) for anyone who shouldn’t get behind the wheel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"homeliabilityinsuranceawayfromhome\">Home liability insurance away from home</h2>\n<p>One last note: even if you’re not hosting the Super Bowl bash this year, your home liability insurance may protect you. Most policies offer coverage for property damage or personal injury you cause (accidentally) away from your primary residence. So if you ruin those speakers at your neighbor’s house… check your insurance policy. There’s a chance you can make a claim for the repair or replacement costs.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in January 2018.

    body: "<p>These days, people’s homes are filled with televisions, computers, mobile phones, gaming consoles and even appliances that all connect to the internet. While all of these internet-connected devices simplify our lives, they can also make it easier for unscrupulous people to access our homes. The result? Home network security needs to be a priority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomenetwork\">What is a home network?</h2>\n<p>Your home network is all of the devices in your house that connect to the internet and each other. Some examples of these devices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computers.</li>\n<li>Televisions</li>\n<li>Smartphones.</li>\n<li>Gaming devices.</li>\n<li>Smart appliances.</li>\n<li>Printers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, many homeowners have a broadband connection that uses a modem and a router to give multiple devices internet access.</p>\n<p>Hackers can take advantage of vulnerabilities in your home network to install malware, steal data, or commit <a href=\"/glossary/identity-fraud-insurance/\">identity fraud</a>. These tips can reduce the likelihood of that happening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1updateyourhomenetworksnameandpassword\">1. Update your home network’s name and password</h2>\n<p>One of the first things you should do when securing your home network is to change the default name and password of your home network. By changing the network name, also called the Service Set Identifier (SSID), to a non-generic name, you show cyber criminals that you’re paying attention.</p>\n<p>Hackers often target home networks using a default name because they assume the owner isn’t managing the system. Moreover, cyber criminals can recognize the manufacturer of a router by its default name and any vulnerabilities associated with it. Changing your networks’ name makes it more difficult to exploit.</p>\n<p>You should also change the default password of your router to a strong password with at least 12 characters that’s a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Leaving the default password on a router can make it easier to hack – especially if the router manufacturer is well known in cyber communities.</p>\n<p>One last note: When setting up a custom SSID and password, you never want to use personal information, such as your name and address. Passwords with personal information can be easily guessed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2useaguestnetwork\">2. Use a guest network</h2>\n<p>Having guests over is great, but it usually means you’ll have additional devices logging in on your home network. Unfortunately, your guest’s smartphone could have malware that can attack other devices connected to your WiFi.</p>\n<p>A guest network lets your friends connect to your WiFi without giving them access to any folders, network devices, or storage devices that are shared on your primary network. Setting one up is usually easy to do from your device settings. Just remember you’ll need to create a separate SSID and strong password to go along with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3turnonyourrouterfirewall\">3. Turn on your router firewall</h2>\n<p>Router firewalls should be turned on as they are great ways to protect against unwanted traffic from going in and out of your home network. They essentially act as a barrier to your network from other internet devices, while still allowing devices on your network to connect to other internet devices. Router firewalls may be off by default, so you need to double check this setting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4encryptyourhomenetwork\">4. Encrypt your home network</h2>\n<p>Most routers come with an encryption option that can be turned on and allow you to further secure your network. These encryption levels include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WEP.</strong> This stands for wired equivalent privacy, and it’s the first level of security developed to provide the same level of security found in wired networks.</li>\n<li><strong>WPA2</strong>. Developed in 2004, WPA2 increases the security found in WEP.</li>\n<li><strong>WPA3.</strong> WPA3 was created to both simplify WiFi security and improve upon features found in WPA2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should aim to use WPA2 or WPA3 because they are more secure, but all these options encrypt the information that is sent and received over your home network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5disableremoteaccess\">5. Disable remote access</h2>\n<p>Many routers have a remote access feature that allows your WiFi network to be accessible from anywhere there is an internet connection. That may be an amazing convenience for you, but it also makes it easy for a hacker to gain entry into your home. Unless you absolutely need the feature, it’s best to turn off the remote access setting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6updateyourfevicesregularly\">6. Update your fevices regularly</h2>\n<p>Both your home network and the devices connected to it need to be updated. Devices not up to date may have vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited by criminals, so patching them whenever a new update is released is so important.</p>\n<p>Some devices like routers may not be updated automatically, so you want to get in the habit of updating your router manually on a recurring basis. This can go a long way towards making your home network more secure. The process for this is different with every router, so take the time to look up how to install updates or turn on automatic updates if possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7turnoffyournetworkwhenyougo\">7. Turn off your network when you go</h2>\n<p>If you are going on vacation or leaving your house for an extended period of time, it’s best to turn off your router. This helps ensure no one has access to your home network. Hackers will be unable to see or target your devices, giving you peace of mind while away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheauthors\">About the authors</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigailschulte/\"><em>Abby Schulte</em></a> <em>is a senior security analyst with Kin Insurance.

    body: "<p>If you’re planning to give your home a facelift, you want to make sure you’ve got adequate homeowners insurance during construction.  Here’s a rundown of what you’ll need, insurance-wise, to make sure you and your property are adequately protected during the renovation process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doineedhomerenovationinsurance\">Do I need home renovation insurance?</h2>\n<p>There’s no such thing as home renovation insurance per se, but having your home renovated can change your risk exposures. That’s why it’s a good idea to talk to your homeowners insurance agent before breaking ground.</p>\n<p>Depending on how you’re tackling the project, you may need to do three things to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Update the coverage limit of your policy overall.</strong> If the renovation includes an addition or upgraded appliances, you may need to increase the dwelling and personal property coverage limits to ensure that you have enough protection for the new version of your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your medical expenses coverage limit.</strong> Is your renovation a <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">DIY project</a> with help from family members or friends who don’t live in your home? Then you may want to talk to your agent about increasing the limit of the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical expenses</a> part of your policy. This portion of your policy covers medical bills for injuries that happen on your property to people other than you and your family.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure you have adequate personal property coverage.</strong> Things can break during construction. Worse? Sometimes your personal items disappear. Make sure you have adequate <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a> for items like furniture, appliances, electronics, and clothing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A quick call with your agent should let you know whether you need to make any changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"renovationprojectsthatcanimpacthomeinsurance\">Renovation projects that can impact home insurance</h2>\n<p>Any renovation projects you take on that can materially affect the value of your home can have a real impact on your home insurance. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing a <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">swimming pool</a>.</li>\n<li>Getting a new <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof</a>.</li>\n<li>Altering or replacing your <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-hvac/\">HVAC system</a>.</li>\n<li>Updating your kitchen.</li>\n<li>Redoing bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Adding a porch or deck.</li>\n<li>Replacing windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These aren’t the only projects that can impact your homeowner policy. Be sure to check with an agent before undertaking any major projects to see if policy changes are required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecovernewadditions\">Does homeowners insurance cover new additions?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance is designed to get your home back to the condition it was in before you experienced a loss, so claim payouts usually don’t help with new additions. More importantly, an addition means more <a href=\"/blog/how-to-calculate-square-footage-of-a-house/\">square footage</a>. The extra size can make you underinsured, which is why it’s so important to call your insurance agent before you start remodeling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherremodelinginsurancepolicies\">Other remodeling insurance policies</h2>\n<p>In addition to potentially boosting your <a href=\"/blog/not-so-basic-home-insurance/\">basic homeowners insurance</a>, there are two other policies you may need to know about when renovating your house. Both are usually purchased by the business performing the work, but knowing about them means you can check if your contractor is properly insured.</p>\n<p>The first policy is often called builder’s risk insurance. Coverage can vary, but builder’s risk policies protect the project in progress. For example, a builder’s risk policy may cover losses related to stolen materials, vandalism, or fire damage to the materials or equipment on your property.</p>\n<p>Essentially, builder’s risk insurance protects people with an <a href=\"/glossary/insurable-interest/\">insurable interest</a>, or financial stake, in your renovation. That describes both you and your contractor because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your contractor wants to protect their equipment and any interest they have in the materials.</li>\n<li>You want to protect your house and the addition as it’s being built in case there’s a storm or theft.</li>\n<li>Both of you want to protect any work that’s been completed. If a fire burns down a half-completed renovation, for example, a builder’s risk policy can help cover the costs of redoing the work and replacing materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: The contractor typically buys this coverage, but some cities may require you to get it before you get a building permit.</p>\n<p>You also want to make sure your contractor has general liability insurance. This is a kind of commercial insurance that business owners get to protect them from lawsuits over property damage and <a href=\"/glossary/bodily-injury/\">bodily injury</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s say, for instance, you believe your contractor is responsible for an injury you suffered, so you sue. The contractor’s general liability policy would likely cover the contractor’s legal costs.</p>\n<p>In other words, a contractor with insurance is a much better financial risk for you than one who isn’t insured. So, if you plan to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hire a contractor</a>, be sure to get proof of insurance first. Verify that this insurance is active and will be active for the duration of your renovation. work with a contractor</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenindoubtcallyourinsuranceprovider\">When in doubt, call your insurance provider</h2>\n<p>No two homes are alike, and no two renovation projects are, either. If you’re not sure how your insurance will need to be adjusted for a remodeling project, reach out to your insurance provider to see what it recommends.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in July 2018.

Make a plan to pay off your renovation before you charge it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whichhomerenovationsshouldyouputonacreditcard\">Which Home Renovations Should You Put on a Credit Card?</h2>\n<p>If you plan to use a credit card for renovations, you’re not alone. According to a <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/RoleofCreditCardsinU.S.HomeImprovement2018.pdf\">study by online home decorating community Houzz</a>, one in three homeowners uses credit cards for home improvement.</p>\n<p>While credit cards make large home purchases seem more feasible in the short term, in the long run, they can be a really expensive way to spend money. Still, sometimes they make more sense or are your only option.</p>\n<p>The key is understanding why you want to renovate. Let's look at the two most common reasons for updating your home – <a href=\"/blog/low-rates-a-remodel-away/\">renovating to increase your home’s value</a> and renovating to make your home more livable – and when using a credit card might work for both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"renovatingtoincreaseahomesvalue\">Renovating to Increase a Home’s Value</h2>\n<p>If you’re trying to increase your home's value before you sell, it’s a good idea to see what’s popular on the housing market. Maybe you want to add a deck because decks are all the rage in your neighborhood, or maybe your kitchen needs some modernizing because you bought your house a decade ago.</p>\n<p>To make the best decision on which upgrades to pursue, talk to your realtor and find out what will help you sell your house at the best possible price. That way you can make the smartest decision on which renovations to prioritize, how much you spend, and how you pay for them.</p>\n<p>You should also understand how much your home’s value will appreciate on its own based on the housing market. Right now, homes appreciate at an annual rate of about <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/october-2017-market-report-17329/\">6 percent</a>. Your real estate agent can help you find out how much your upgrades will cost relative to how much they’ll increase your home’s worth.</p>\n<p>If your improvements cost less than the total price increase of your home, it might make sense to use credit if you don’t have the cash upfront. Assuming everything goes to plan, you’ll be able to pay off your credit card when you sell your home.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, though, some renovations will actually make your home <a href=\"https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/home-renovations-hurt-homes-value/#7\">more difficult to sell</a>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carpeting, which is less desirable than laminate or hardwood and shows signs of damage easily.</li>\n<li>Textured walls, popcorn ceilings, and wallpaper – they’re a pain for buyers to remove.</li>\n<li>Ornate light fixtures and decorations that make your home look dated.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Talk to your realtor to find out what renovations will help you sell your house at the best possible price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/renovation-credit-3.jpg?width=2784&name=renovation-credit-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"renovatingtoincreaseahomeslivability\">Renovating to Increase a Home’s Livability</h2>\n<p>If you’re upgrading your home to make it more livable, the renovations are probably necessities. Things like updating your plumbing or adding accessibility features like ramps make your home safer and more convenient.</p>\n<p>For renovations that can’t wait, a credit card may be your only option. The problem, of course, is if that if you don’t have the cash up front, you could end up paying a hefty interest rate, which will increase the cost of your renovation.</p>\n<p>Houzz reports that 62 percent of credit card users intend to eliminate their balance over time. If you don’t want to end up with a huge debt you can’t handle, “eventually” won’t cut it for how you plan to pay off your card. If you intend to stay in your home after renovating, be sure to map out how you want clear any credit card charges as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Two things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you can pay the balance off within three to six months, a credit card may make sense, especially if it offers benefits like extra points, cash back, or miles. But always calculate any interest you’ll end up paying to make sure the benefits you get equal or exceed the interest you pay.</li>\n<li>A credit card might be cost-effective if you have a card with a promotional rate (e.g., zero percent interest for 12 months). You could conceivably charge the purchase and pay it off within the year without paying any interest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But having a payment plan is hugely important: as soon as the promotional rate expires, you’ll be paying interest (average interest rates right now are <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/what-is-a-good-apr-for-a-credit-card/\">north of 16 percent)</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Credit card interest rates are currently 16 percent on average.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"otherfinancialconsiderationsforarenovation\">Other Financial Considerations for a Renovation</h2>\n<p>One final thought: while credit card debt is a financial liability when you’re updating your home, it’s far from the only one. Here are two more things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check your contractors’ insurance:</strong> Make sure your contractors have general liability coverage so you’re covered if their work damages your property and workers’ compensation so they’ve got access to funds to pay for any injuries they incur while doing the work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/home-remodel-insurance-considerations/\"><strong>Include your new home additions in your insurance policy</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Your homeowner's insurance is based on the value of your house and its contents. A major renovation could change the kind and level of coverage you need, so be sure to check with your insurance company about whether you need an update. (Tip: not all renovations lead to higher insurance rates; some, like stronger roofs, can actually bring your premiums down!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: renovations are a big deal. Before making any major decisions, be sure to weigh the financial ramifications so you’re confident that any updates you decide to go for make sense for the long term.</p>"

    body: "<p>We’re in the business of home insurance, which means we’re ready to help when something goes wrong at your house. But it also means we’re big fans of home safety. When homeowners put safety first, they usually end up filing fewer insurance claims. That’s good for us and them!</p>\n<p>We’ve put together this list of common household hazards and home safety tips to help you reduce accidents and claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"housefires\">House Fires</h2>\n<p>According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the US saw an average of approximately <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Building-and-Life-Safety/Home-Structure-Fires\">346,800 home fires</a> in one five year period. The main causes for these fires were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooking, 50 percent.</li>\n<li>Heating equipment, 13 percent.</li>\n<li>Electrical distribution and lighting equipment, 9 percent.</li>\n<li>Intentional, 7 percent.</li>\n<li>Smoking materials, 5 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the cause of a home fire, the results can be devastating, leading to property damage, injuries, and sadly, even death. That makes <a href=\"/blog/fire-prevention-for-homeowners/\">fire prevention</a> an important part of home safety. These tips can help you protect your home and family:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never leave the kitchen unattended while cooking.</li>\n<li>Keep flammable items like oven mitts, curtains, and food packaging away from your stovetop.</li>\n<li>Save extension cords for temporary use and plug electric devices directly into wall outlets.</li>\n<li>Remove power cords from doorways and from underneath carpets.</li>\n<li>Store matches and lighters out of children’s reach.</li>\n<li>Service your furnace annually to keep it clean and working properly to avoid potential fires.</li>\n<li>Replace old or <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a>.</li>\n<li>Always be careful when burning candles or smoking in the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, be sure you have smoke detectors on every floor of your house and test them every month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swimmingpoolinjuries\">Swimming Pool Injuries</h2>\n<p>While backyard pools are a great way to entertain family and friends, they also present some serious hazards for homeowners and guests alike. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the US sees <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/facts/index.html\">3,960 fatal drownings</a> and 8,080 nonfatal drowning every year. This risk is one of the reasons swimming pools are often considered an <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisance</a> that may impact your homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>You can do a lot to increase pool safety, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building a fence around your pool to limit access.</li>\n<li>Monitoring children and pets whenever they’re in or near the pool.</li>\n<li>Enrolling your children in water safety and swimming lessons.</li>\n<li>Installing a safety vacuum release system and anti-entrapment drain covers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"falls\">Falls</h2>\n<p>While just about anyone may experience a fall, the people most likely to be injured from one are young children and the elderly. The annual count of older adults reporting falls is north of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html#\">36 million</a>, according to the CDC. On the other end of the spectrum, Stanford’s Children’s Health claims more than <a href=\"https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=falls--injury-statistics-and-incidence-rates-90-P02974#\">2.2 million children</a> under the age of 14 visit hospital emergency rooms for fall injuries each year.</p>\n<p>A big part of fall prevention is to be on the lookout for tripping hazards. Toys, pet gear, loose rugs, and electrical cords can all cause someone to trip. But you might also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place furniture so there is plenty of space to walk around a room.</li>\n<li>Put grab bars and non-slip rubber mats in your bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Add railings to your staircases, both inside and out.</li>\n<li>Upgrade your lighting.</li>\n<li>Install window guards.</li>\n<li>Use a sturdy step stool to reach higher shelves.</li>\n<li>Put soft materials under play equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"poisoning\">Poisoning</h2>\n<p>The most recent data available shows that poison control centers across the US guided more than <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national\">2.1 million people</a> after poison exposures. According to the National Capital Poison Center, that’s one poison exposure reported to a poison control center every 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Here are some home safety tips to reduce the chances of poisoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep poisonous substances including medications, cleaners, and detergents on a high shelf or behind a locked cabinet door.</li>\n<li>Avoid mixing household chemicals.</li>\n<li>Get all medications in childproof packaging.</li>\n<li>Keep cleaners, chemicals, and medications in their original containers.</li>\n<li>Avoid eating or drinking when around poisonous substances, including art supplies.</li>\n<li>Avoid using pesticides around children and pets.</li>\n<li>Stay vigilant when handling any chemicals or medicines when you have young children around. If you’re suddenly called away﹘even for a minute﹘secure what your using to keep your children safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s another set of poisons in addition to those that someone might ingest. Substances like carbon monoxide, radon, mold, asbestos, and lead paint may be even more hazardous because they can exist in your home without you even knowing about it.</p>\n<p>Home safety tips to protect your family from these harmful toxins usually involves hiring a professional, but you may also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with when and where asbestos and lead paint were commonly used.</li>\n<li>Install carbon monoxide alarms.</li>\n<li>Avoid idling your car in your garage.</li>\n<li>Make sure your rooms and any fuel-burning appliances are well ventilated.</li>\n<li>Buy a radon test kit.</li>\n<li>Use a dehumidifier to keep humidity levels below 50 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before doing any work in the house, check with an expert to make sure you aren’t exposing your family to these hazardous substances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"naturaldisasters\">Natural Disasters</h2>\n<p>Natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, present a serious risk for homeowners. One report found that 13 major disasters from 2021 caused an estimated <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220217005368/en/CoreLogic-Climate-Change-Catastrophe-Report-Estimates-1-in-10-U.S.-Residential-Properties-Impacted-by-Natural-Disasters-in-2021\">$56.92 billion</a> in property damage to nearly 15 million single- and multifamily homes.</p>\n<p>You can’t prevent natural disasters, but you can minimize their impact on your home. The first step is to figure out what sort of <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> you face. A good way to do that is with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/national-risk-index\">National Risk Index</a> that risk communities have for 18 natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Once you know what your exposures are, you can shore up your protection with these home safety tips for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flood.</strong> Easy steps to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">minimize flood damage</a> include cleaning your gutters regularly, using mulch in your garden, and installing a backflow valve.</li>\n<li><strong>Hurricane.</strong> Maintaining your roof is key to <a href=\"/prep/\">preparing your home for a hurricane</a>. You may also want to invest in hurricane shutters.</li>\n<li><strong>Tornado.</strong> Storm shutters can protect your home in a tornado too. Additionally, you want to keep your <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">trees trimmed</a> to reduce the chance of a limb crashing on your home<strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last step? Make sure you have quality <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. While a homeowners policy can’t keep trouble at bay, it can help you recover from catastrophe. That’s a different kind of home safety tip, but it’s one that you’ll benefit from for a long time coming.</p>"

    body: "<p>Between inspections and paperwork, a lot can go wrong when buying a home. We asked people about their worst homeowner horror stories to help you avoid major headaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aninfestationyoucantgetcovered\">An Infestation You Can’t Get Covered</h2>\n<p>As a cash homebuyer and owner of <a href=\"https://www.webuyhousesinpennsylvania.com\">We Buy Houses In Pennsylvania</a>, Ryan David thought he had seen it all. But when he and his wife bought a house for their personal residence, they quickly discovered they had uninvited guests: fleas!</p>\n<p>They couldn’t move into their new home immediately, so they only found out about the “super flea infestation” several months after closing. As a result, David says they “spent hundreds of dollars on flea removal.”</p>\n<p>Worse? The experience still haunts him: “Every time I walk into an empty home I'll always be on the lookout for fleas.”</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Unfortunately for David and his wife, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t usually cover damage caused by pests like fleas, termites, and rodents. They may have been able to protect themselves by requesting a pest inspection prior to closing in addition to a <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aninspectionmostdontthinkof\">An Inspection Most Don’t Think Of</h2>\n<p>Rick Conti says “many homeowners willingly do a termite inspection, but often skip the bed bug inspection.” And in his experience, that choice can cost homeowners anxiety, stress, and money.</p>\n<p>Conti’s company <a href=\"https://doctorsniffs.com/\">Doctor Sniffs Bed Bug Dogs</a> recently worked with a client who had a home inspection prior to buying a house. After sealing the deal, the client started renovations﹘which is when the trouble began.</p>\n<p>“As they tore down walls and pulled back moldings,” he says, “the bed bugs began turning up. They called us in and our dogs searched the entire house, finding bed bugs all over the place.”</p>\n<p>Bed bugs are nocturnal, according to Conti. They prefer the dark and like cracks and crevices, so the new homeowners did not notice anything beforehand. The experience was so terrible, the homeowners told Conti they wouldn't have bought the house if they’d known about the bed bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Like fleas, bed bugs and the damage they cause aren’t typically covered by a homeowners policy. But you can also get a bed bug inspection to root out any problems if you’re concerned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"awhirlwindofpaperworkgetslost\">A Whirlwind of Paperwork Gets Lost</h2>\n<p>Founder of <a href=\"https://academialabs.com\">Academia Labs</a> Craig Miller says a simple mix-up with his wife caused his homeowner horror story. The couple experienced minor wind damage from a tornado, so their agent sent them paperwork to file an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>.</p>\n<p>“After completing all the necessary documents,” says Miller “I placed them on the coffee table in our living room. When I did not see them the next day, I assumed that my wife had submitted the paperwork to the agent, so I just waited.”</p>\n<p>Miller waited patiently﹘for six months. At that point, he followed up with his agent only to be told that the agent had never received the claim documents. It turns out that Miller’s wife had put the papers in a desk drawer, which meant they hadn’t been filed in time and the Millers’ claim was ultimately denied.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Miscommunications happen, but <a href=\"/glossary/policyholder/\">policyholders</a> are required to promptly report claims so it’s important to stay on top of your paperwork. Start by deciding who is responsible for actually filing the claim. That way, you avoid assumptions and confusion.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don’t wait to follow up with your agent. You should have an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">insurance adjuster</a> to your home within days and at a maximum two weeks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragedidntstartatthecloseofescrow\">Coverage Didn’t Start at the Close of Escrow</h2>\n<p>Marina Vaamonde, a residential real estate investor with <a href=\"https://housecashin.com\">House Cashin</a>, didn’t follow her insurance agent’s advice and it ended up costing her dearly. She was in the process of closing on a new home when she contacted her agent about home insurance.</p>\n<p>She says, “He told me to wait for a day to close on the house so that the policy could kick in the day that I took ownership.” Instead of following that sage advice, Vaamonde decided to go one day without coverage. Unfortunately, that’s the day a deer crashed through her new home’s sliding glass door. And because her homeowners policy wasn’t effective until the next day, Vaamonde was responsible for all of the repair bills.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Insurance might seem like overkill during that brief window between closing on a house and moving in, but Vaamonde’s story shows just how risky that can be. Remember that you’re responsible for your home the moment you close, even if you aren’t living there, so home insurance is key to protecting your investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theinspectiondidntshowaproblem\">The Inspection Didn’t Show a Problem</h2>\n<p>Jake Romano has seen several homeowner horror stories in his work with <a href=\"https://johntheplumber.ca/oakville\">John the Plumber</a>. One client, Romano says, purchased a home in the winter. Despite everything seeming fine during the inspection, the house turned out to be prone to flooding in the spring. He says the client ended up installing a sump pit, sump pump, battery backup sump pump, and weeping tiles all in the first spring they lived in the home.</p>\n<p>Homeowners can prevent a major problem like this by having a plumber do an inspection with a camera to see the health of the pipes all the way to the street, where they become the city’s responsibility.</p>"

    body: "<p>Your homeowners insurance may cover damage from the zombie apocalypse. Yes, you read that right.</p>\n<p>We’ve all seen the movies about zombies: usually a virus breaks out and suddenly friends and neighbors are transformed into the decaying, lumbering undead, hungry only for brains and flesh. Society collapses. Heroes rise up. An enduring battle between the living and dead ensues.</p>\n<p>It all seems far fetched until one day you wake up in the year 2020, watching a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-coronavirus/\">pandemic</a> play out in real time, and suddenly you’re making plans for all those worst-case scenarios you never thought would happen.</p>\n<p>So let’s do the thought experiment. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, would <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> save the day? And how exactly do you prepare for an event like that?</p>\n<h2 id=\"abriefhistoryofzombiesandzombieinsurance\">A Brief History of Zombies and Zombie Insurance</h2>\n<p>You may know zombies from <em>The Walking Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil</em> – you name it. Zombies are part of our cultural landscape – and they’ve been around longer than you might think.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists found evidence of what could be an old fear of the undead when they discovered graves from Ancient Greece with skeletons pinned down by rocks. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/folklore/history-of-zombies\">Historians theorize</a> these were meant to keep the dead from rising up.</p>\n<p>But modern zombies may have tragic roots in 17th century Haiti where enslaved people from West African were forced to work on brutal sugar cane plantations. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/how-america-erased-the-tragic-history-of-the-zombie/412264/\">As the Atlantic puts it</a>, the zombie archetype represents the misery of slavery, of being trapped in a body and denied its autonomy.</p>\n<p>The idea of the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/folklore/history-of-zombies\">zombie further evolved through voodoo</a>, a religion practiced throughout Haiti and the Caribbean. Some believe zombies are people revived by voodoo practitioners (called <em>bokors</em>) through the use of “zombie powders” that contain tetrodotoxin. This is a neurotoxin usually found in pufferfish, and sub-lethal doses of it can cause zombie-like symptoms, like respiratory problems, brain fog, and that famous zombie gait.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiszombieinsurance\">What Is Zombie Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Zombie insurance is a relatively new concept propelled into existence by the popularity of movies and shows like <em>The Walking Dead</em>. The term usually refers to property coverage for a zombie apocalypse, but zombie insurance can also be used to describe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instances of life insurance fraud.</strong> For example, when someone makes a claim on a life insurance policy for someone who isn’t yet dead.</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental liability coverage for properties long after they’ve been sold.</strong> At least <a href=\"https://riskandinsurance.com/environmental-zombie-coverage/\">that’s what Max West of Aon refers to it as</a>. This coverage protects a seller if they’re sued over selling properties with environmental contaminants they didn’t know about at the time of the sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our purposes, we’ll focus on zombie insurance for property damage. Let’s see whether your home insurance policy might include it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zombiesthemagicofanopenperilspolicy\">Zombies &amp; The Magic of an Open-Perils Policy</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of different types of homeowners insurance policies. The form used for your policy determines how many situations and events you’re covered for.</p>\n<p>For example, the type of homeowners insurance we offer is an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>, also called a Special Form. The simple beauty of this type of policy is that it covers your dwelling and other structures for <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">all perils</a> <strong>except those clearly listed in the policy as exclusions.</strong> Common exclusions are damage caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earth movement</li>\n<li>Sewer or drain backup</li>\n<li>Power failure</li>\n<li>Neglect</li>\n<li>War</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazard</li>\n<li>Intentional loss</li>\n<li>Government action</li>\n<li>Theft while the home is under construction</li>\n<li>Vandalism if the property is vacant for 30 or more days</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/law-ordinance-coverage/\">Ordinance or law</a> that requires you to rebuild your home</li>\n<li>Mold, fungus, or rot</li>\n<li>Wear and tear</li>\n<li>Mechanical breakdown</li>\n<li>Smog, rust, or corrosion</li>\n<li>Industrial or agricultural smoke or smog</li>\n<li>Pollutants</li>\n<li>Settling, shrinking, bulging, or expanding of the structure</li>\n<li>Birds, vermin, rodents, insects</li>\n<li>Animals you own</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words…</p>\n<p>Unless this type of homeowners policy specifically excludes damage to your dwelling caused by zombies, it just might be covered!</p>\n<p>So say it’s the early days of the zombie apocalypse and society is still functioning enough that insurance and money are still a thing. A horde of zombies crash through your fence and on through your front door. Your family manages to hide until the horde gets bored and moves on, but not before your home takes a proper beating: a trampled fence, broken windows, doors pulled from their hinges, gaping holes in your walls, and gore everywhere.</p>\n<p>Your insurance may cover those repair and cleanup costs.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>the language in your policy matters.</strong> Some forms will have special provisions or exclusions, so if you want to be sure you’re covered for zombies, it’s best to ask and check.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zombieinsuranceforpersonalbelongings\">Zombie Insurance for Personal Belongings</h2>\n<p>While an HO3 policy is offered on an <em>open-perils basis</em> for your dwelling, it typically offers <em>named-perils coverage</em> for your stuff.</p>\n<p>That means your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">belongings are covered</a> only for damage caused by events clearly listed in your policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fires or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorms or hail</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental water overflow or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’ll notice zombies aren’t on that list. That means if zombies thrash around your house and bust your TV and shatter the fine china you got on your wedding day, it’s not covered.</p>\n<p>But if zombies manage to start a fire in your home that damages your cabinets, appliances, and clothes, your policy may cover that.</p>\n<p>You can add on all-perils coverage for your belongings, but it does cost a little extra.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zombiepreparednesswhattokeepinyourzombiesurvivalkit\">Zombie Preparedness: What to Keep in Your Zombie Survival Kit</h2>\n<p>So now you know how your insurance may handle a zombie apocalypse, but what can you do <em>before</em> the zombies arrive?</p>\n<p>The CDC recommends making an emergency kit (fun fact: this comes in handy for ALL disasters, not just fighting off the undead). Keep this kit in your house – it will buy you some time until you can safely evacuate.</p>\n<p>These are some of the items you should include in your kit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water.</strong> As a rule, store one gallon per person per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Food.</strong> Non-perishable items, like canned beans and vegetables, are a great place to start!</li>\n<li><strong>Medications.</strong> This includes prescriptions and over the counter medications like ibuprofen.</li>\n<li><strong>Tools and supplies.</strong> Have a flashlight, utility knife, duct tape, and hand-crank radio ready.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanitation and hygiene supplies.</strong> Think: soap, toothbrushes, household bleach, and towels.</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing and bedding.</strong> Pack a change of clothes for each family member and blankets.</li>\n<li><strong>Important documents.</strong> That includes your proof of insurance, driver’s license, passport, birth certificate, Social Security card, etc. If you have <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pets</a>, include their vaccination records.

    body: "<p>You don't need an estimate. You need a quote.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance estimates used to be a cornerstone of the industry. And why not? Back in the day when the only way to get homeowners insurance was to fill out a long paper form and wait a couple weeks while the insurance company processed it and maybe called you to clarify a few points and then took a few more weeks, it made sense to offer rough estimates of what coverage would cost ahead of time.</p>\n<p>But times, thankfully, have changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsuranceestimatevshomeownersinsurancequote\">Homeowners Insurance Estimate vs. Homeowners Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>An estimate gives homeowners a ballpark idea – in just a few seconds – of what they might pay for coverage. An estimate is quick. It lets homeowners comparison shop before committing to the process of filling out a multi-page application filled with questions about things they don’t know, like when their roof was last updated.</p>\n<p>But today, it’s not enough to be quick. In fact, in today’s data-driven insurance world, it’s not even enough to be an estimate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyoudontneedahouseinsuranceestimate\">Why You Don’t Need a House Insurance Estimate</h2>\n<p>Today, it’s possible to provide <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">real-time homeowners insurance quotes</a>. A quote is different from an estimate in three major ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s <strong>based on the actual details</strong> <strong>about your home</strong> and its location, whereas an estimate is calculated as an average of many homes.</li>\n<li>It shows the <strong>actual amount you’ll pay</strong> in premiums.</li>\n<li>It’s “bindable,” which, in the insurance world, means you can say, “That looks good” and sign on the dotted line and <strong>get exactly what you see for exactly the price you see</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the past (including the pretty recent past), house insurance estimates were important because they were much quicker than getting actual quotes. A quote required the insurance company to process all kinds of paperwork and verify various facts about your location and the construction of your home.</p>\n<p>Today, quotes are available within seconds from companies like Kin. Instead of showing you the average cost of all homeowners insurance policies in your neighborhood or for houses built when yours was, we can just tell you how much your insurance will cost.</p>\n<p>This is excellent news if you’re <a href=\"/blog/how-to-compare-home-insurance/\">shopping around for homeowners insurance</a>. It makes the process a lot more like shopping for a new pair of sneakers: you can visit various providers and see what the actual cost of your coverage will be, then choose the provider that offers you the best coverage for the best price.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforgettingagreathomeownersinsurancequote\">Tips for Getting A Great Homeowners Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>Today’s data processing models are excellent at pricing home insurance coverage based on information that’s publicly available about your home (year it was built, proximity to a fire station, etc.). But there are some details only you will know. After getting a lightning-fast quote from Kin or a similar company, be sure to talk to an agent about the following to make sure the policy you get covers everything you need it to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mention any high-value items you have in your house</strong>. These might include musical instruments, furs, jewelry, art, guns, and other things that have a high replacement cost. Your agent can make sure your policy includes coverage limits adequate to protect them.</li>\n<li><strong>Mention any business activities you do in your home</strong>. This might include running a daycare, teaching guitar lessons, <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">renting your home on Airbnb</a>, or plenty of other things. Most homeowners policies exclude business activities from coverage, so if you run a money-making operation from your home, it’s important to cover it separately.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask about cost-saving promotions</strong>. <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">Kin offers a few programs</a> that improve a home’s safety and lower the premium on your homeowners insurance. Most of them are free to you or available for a very low cost.</li>\n</ol>"

    body: "<p>After a homeowners insurance nonrenewal, homeowners have three options for getting covered: contest the nonrenewal, apply elsewhere, or turn to a state-run carrier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancenonrenewals\">Homeowners insurance nonrenewals</h2>\n<p>The last few years have seen historically destructive wildfire seasons in California. As a result, increasing numbers of California homeowners have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-your-insurer-decides-your-home-isnt-worth-the-risk-11576078132\">received nonrenewal notices from their insurance providers</a> – that is, they’ve gotten letters stating that their carrier will not renew their homeowners insurance policy. (<a href=\"/velocity/\">It happens in Florida, too</a>.)</p>\n<p>While a nonrenewal can happen for a number of reasons, the spate of wildfire-related nonrenewals in California is tied to what’s known as a changed carrier appetite – in other words, the carrier is no longer interested in providing coverage to the homeowners in question because it has determined their risk exposure is too high.</p>\n<p>So where does that leave homeowners? Let's look at what nonrenewals are, outline options homeowners have for finding alternate coverage, and take a peek at life after a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> nonrenewal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurancenonrenewalvsinsurancecancellation\">Insurance nonrenewal vs. insurance cancellation</h2>\n<p>It’s important to note here that insurance nonrenewals and cancellations are two different things.</p>\n<p>A cancellation can only happen for two reasons once your homeowners policy has been in force for 60 days or more:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You didn’t pay your premium.</li>\n<li>You misrepresented information on your application or committed fraud of some kind.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A cancellation can happen at any time during your policy, assuming one of those two things happens. The reason? If you don’t pay or commit fraud, you’ve breached the terms of your insurance policy, which is a contract between you and the insurer. The insurer is therefore within its rights to cancel the policy.</p>\n<p>State law requires carriers to give homeowners a certain amount of notice if a policy will be nonrenewed. In California, insurance companies must give homeowners at least 60 days’ notice if they plan to nonrenew a policy. Nonrenewals are different. They can happen only when an insurance provider or policyholder decides not to renew a policy when its term is up. If you’ve ever switched from one insurance carrier to another, you’ve nonrenewed a policy.</p>\n<p>And regardless of state, insurance companies can nonrenew a policy for a number of reasons, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They no longer offer the coverage you were paying for.</li>\n<li>They are no longer licensed to offer policies in your state.</li>\n<li>You no longer fit in their acceptable risk profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last one is the biggest bucket, as a lot of variables determine what an insurance carrier considers “acceptable.” It’s also the one that the California wildfire nonrenewals fall into: after paying millions of dollars for wildfire-related claims, insurance companies are nonrenewing policies in an effort to manage their overall risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Of course, that may make sense for the insurance company. But what are homeowners supposed to do when their policy is nonrenewed?</p>\n<h2 id=\"3optionswhenyourhomeownersinsuranceisnonrenewed\">3 options when your homeowners insurance is nonrenewed</h2>\n<p>If your homeowners insurance is nonrenewed, whether you’re in California or not, you typically have three options to regain coverage.</p>\n<p>First, you can <strong>contest the nonrenewal decision</strong> with your insurance provider.</p>\n<p>To do this, contact your insurance provider and lay out the case for why you think the nonrenewal was unjust. Of course, that means you have to have a case in the first place. Here are the two arguments most likely to work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your house is not as risky as the insurer thinks it is</strong>. Many insurance companies rely on big data sets to create risk maps. In places with microclimates or great variation within a small geographical area, it’s possible that risk exposure varies considerably from block to block. If you can demonstrate to your insurer that this is the case, you may be able to justify a coverage renewal.</li>\n<li><strong>You’ve taken steps to mitigate your risk exposure</strong>. In many cases, it’s possible to reduce your exposure to major risks with landscaping, <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof modifications</a>, and other updates to your property. (This is true in every region, regardless of the specific risks you face.) If you can demonstrate to your insurer that you’ve adequately mitigated your risk, they may be able to renew your coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, there’s no guarantee that contesting your nonrenewal will be successful. In the case of what’s happening in California right now, the threat of wildfires is so great that it’s not likely any individual homeowner can demonstrate that their risk exposure is significantly less than that of their neighbors.</p>\n<p>If contesting the nonrenewal doesn’t work, your next option is to <strong>get coverage with another homeowners insurance provider</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you can't get coverage through a private insurer, Californians can <strong>get insurance from the state’s FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) insurer</strong>. The state-run insurer for Floridians is <a href=\"/faq/citizens/\">Citizens Property Insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Citizens and FAIR insurance are considered insurance of last resort. It exists so that no homeowner, no matter how risky, has to go without insurance entirely.</p>\n<p>But it’s important to note that, in California at least, FAIR insurance may not offer the same protections as a standard homeowners policy. Let’s take a quick detour into the nitty gritty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"californiafairplanwhatitcoverswhatitdoesnt\">California FAIR Plan: What it covers, what it doesn’t</h3>\n<p>During normal times, FAIR homeowners insurance policies offer coverage ONLY for <a href=\"/blog/what-is-hazard-insurance/\">fire-related risks</a>. That is, they can pay to rebuild or repair a house that’s damaged or ruined by fire. These policies do not include the other protections typically baked into homeowners insurance, including property protection for other perils (like wind) or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>But in December 2019, California’s insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2019/12/13/551251.htm\">ordered FAIR</a> to start offering comprehensive homeowners insurance to policyholders. While this might sound like good news to those unable to find insurance elsewhere, the reality is more complicated.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the FAIR program have reportedly claimed that the plan doesn’t have adequate resources to provide the protection of a comprehensive homeowners insurance policy. Its leaders have asked the courts to overturn Lara’s order. If the FAIR plan is required to provide the coverage anyway, it may face a serious financial strain.</p>\n<p>For now, it’s unclear what will happen. Regardless of the court’s ruling, though, FAIR insurance should be available – in any state – as a coverage of last resort for certain types of catastrophic property damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcaliforniahomeownerscanexpectaboutinsurancenonrenewals\">What California homeowners can expect about insurance nonrenewals</h2>\n<p>Nonrenewals of homeowners insurance in California <a href=\"http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2019/release063-2019.cfm\">surged 10 percent</a> in recent years, largely because of wildfire damage. Obviously, that’s put a lot of homeowners in the difficult position of having to find alternative coverage.</p>\n<p>To offer some short-term relief, Commissioner Lara has asked insurance companies to refrain from issuing nonrenewal notices through December 5, 2020 while he and other leaders work with insurance providers to find longer-term solutions.</p>\n<p>But the moratorium doesn’t help those who have already seen their policy nonrenewed. It also doesn’t offer any guarantee that insurance regulators and insurance companies will actually come to an agreement by next December.</p>\n<p>Assuming you still have coverage, now is a good time to prepare for all potential outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get to know your wildfire risk exposure</strong>. Mitigate it as much as you can by creating defensible space and otherwise protecting your home and property.</li>\n<li><strong>Educate yourself about insurance alternatives</strong>. If you are hit with a nonrenewal next winter, you’ll be ready to find alternate coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask about insurance premiums if you’re in the housing market</strong>. Carrying insurance isn’t just an important way to manage your risk as a homeowner – it’s a requirement of most mortgages. If your dream home is in a wildfire hotspot, you could be looking at tens of thousands of dollars in premium each year, so be sure to factor insurance into your cost calculations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lifeafteraninsurancenonrenewal\">Life after an insurance nonrenewal</h2>\n<p>The unfortunate truth of homeowners insurance nonrenewals is that homeowners don’t have much control over a carrier’s changing appetite. If a carrier decides your home is too risky to insure, there may not be anything you can do.</p>\n<p>If your policy is nonrenewed, though, know that you do have options. You can seek coverage from another provider (including a nonadmitted carrier) and you can seek coverage from your state’s FAIR plan.</p>\n<p>On a more philosophical note, there may also be better alternatives for homeowners in the near future. While insurance providers can’t change the way weather events affect homes, we can use data more intelligently to better understand the risk each individual home faces.</p>\n<p>That’s exactly what we’re doing at Kin: rather than relying on the big-picture data most traditional insurance companies use to evaluate risk, we consider thousands of data points unique to each individual property. Our models can therefore identify the subtle variations in risk that might make your neighbor down the street a risky bet while your house is perfectly safe.</p>\n<p>Curious about whether we might have a policy for you? <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Apply in a matter of minutes</a> to find out.</p>"

    body: "<p>Having a sense of where homeowners insurance prices are makes you a more informed buyer.</p>\n<p>Nationally, prices for homeowners insurance have increased modestly in the last few years: the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/20171016-ab-analytics-homeowners-roe-outlook.pdf\">Aon Benfield 2018 Homeowners’ ROE Outlook Report</a> shows that prices from the country’s top 20 carriers increased by just three percent in the 18 months leading up to August of last year.</p>\n<p>But national averages hide a lot, especially when it comes to homeowners insurance costs. Here’s a deeper dive of what the picture looks like in a few harder-hit states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepricesinfloridaareup5\">Home Insurance Prices in Florida Are Up 5%</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> prices rose faster than the nation as a whole, jumping five percent from from February 2016 through August 2017. One factor that affects the price of homeowners insurance is natural disaster activity. Considering Hurricane Irma hit Florida on August 30 of last year, it’s reasonable to expect that prices might continue to rise for the residents of the Sunshine State.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepricesintexasandnorthcarolinaup7\">Home Insurance Prices in Texas and North Carolina: Up 7%</h2>\n<p>Despite the higher-than-average price hike, though, Florida’s price increases weren’t the country’s largest. <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a> and North Carolina both saw seven percent increases in the same period. Again, given that Harvey struck Texas at the tail end of the period measured, there’s a chance that future prices may be even higher.</p>\n<p>Depending on the larger picture, though, it’s also possible that homeowners insurance prices will be relatively unaffected by the major <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>; instead, the cost of <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> may see a bump. Flood coverage is not included in a typical homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p>One more important note for North Carolinians: the <a href=\"https://portcitydaily.com/local-news/2018/04/20/homeowners-insurance-to-increase-by-5-5-percent-on-the-coast/\">insurance department recently agreed to a rate increase</a>. The statewide average increase is 4.8 percent, but some coastal areas will see increases as much as 5.5 percent (which is far lower than what the state’s rating board requested). What this means for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The state of North Carolina will now allow homeowners insurance carriers to charge slightly higher rates.</li>\n<li>Individual carriers may want to charge more than the state-mandated maximum because they believe they have to do so to remain profitable.</li>\n<li>If you receive such a request from your insurer (a “request to rate” letter), read the fine print. If you don’t accept the request to pay more than the state’s maximum, your carrier may not renew your coverage. (But you can always look for coverage from a different company.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"biggesthomeownersinsurancepriceincreasesinokksco\">Biggest Homeowners Insurance Price Increases in OK, KS, CO</h2>\n<p>One of the industry’s most comprehensive looks at homeowners insurance prices is published by the <a href=\"https://www.naics.com/\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> (NAIC). The most recent report looks at prices from 2007 to 2015 and found the largest increases in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado (ranking first, second, and third, respectively).</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at the causes of those price increases and some ways homeowners in those states can help keep their rates low:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2018/05/02/487938.htm\">Oklahoma</a>: Blame the rise on natural disasters. Between 2007 and 2015, annual premiums for OK homeowners increased by an average of $825. Homeowners who opt for tornado-resistant features (either on new construction or as retrofittings for existing homes) may see some savings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/news/2018/03/29/study-home-insurance-price-increases-hit-kansas.html\">Kansas</a>: Hail, tornadoes, and fire incidents all contributed to the $627 average price increase for KS homeowners. As is true anywhere in the country, making sure you have safety features in place may help reduce your premiums.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/consumer/colorado-home-insurance-rates-rising-among-fastest-in-the-nation\">Colorado</a>: The average yearly insurance premium increases of $557 for CO homeowners can be attributed to both natural disaster activity and the type of new homes being built. Larger homes with higher-quality features (which were apparently popular in Colorado during the period measured) cost more to insure, regardless of what Mother Nature is up to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re looking to save money on your homeowners insurance, we may be able to help. <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Apply for coverage with Kin today</a>.

What we found was kind of surprising: 55 percent of homeowners only sometimes or rarely do home maintenance, and 37 percent lack basic security measures like a security alarm, motion-activated outdoor lighting, or water detection systems.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the results in full and unpack why these measures really matter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surveyhighlights\">Survey highlights</h2>\n<p>Only 45% of homeowners do home maintenance tasks seasonally (i.e., cleaning chimneys and gutters, checking the foundation, making small improvements, etc.).</p>\n<p>37% of respondents don’t have any of the following safety measures in place: security alarm, motion-activated outdoor lighting, automatic water detection &amp; shut-off, hurricane shutters, secured outdoor furniture, or impact-resistant windows.</p>\n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" xml=\"lang\" src=\"//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5cca08153ba0f6ca58782bc5&t=0be4a79d61a42f6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Almost a quarter of respondents (24%) would prioritize adding a centrally monitored security system if they had the budget.</p>\n<p>Most respondents (52%) primarily care about home safety to keep themselves / their family safe.</p>\n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" xml=\"lang\" src=\"//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5cca0afb3ba0f6fd58782bc6&t=1de1a9273ece611\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"homemaintenanceisriskmanagement\">Home maintenance is risk management</h2>\n<p>You might not think of keeping your home in good condition as risk management, but it is. A well-kept home is less likely to experience accidental losses and damage. For example, if you regularly trim trees whose branches hang over your home or powerlines, you’re less likely to experience roof damage or service interruption when a windstorm knocks limbs down.</p>\n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" xml=\"lang\" src=\"//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5cc9ee623ba0f64c4f782bc5&t=ba73bb2d2f586e4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Also, a well-maintained property reduces opportunities for visitor injuries. For example, say you notice your home’s outdoor handrail is loose. If a visitor falls off your porch steps because of that pesky handrail, they could sue you over their medical expenses. But if you fix that handrail right away, you proactively limit the chance of those accidents.</p>\n<p>If homeowners want to keep their families safe, regular maintenance is essential. As we cover in our <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">Ultimate Guide to Home Maintenance</a>, homeowners should do seasonal maintenance to limit the chance of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fires caused by unkempt dryer vents, unmaintained HVAC units, or blocked chimneys</li>\n<li>Water damage caused by blocked gutters and downspouts, frozen pipes, or malfunctioning sump pumps</li>\n<li>Foundation damage caused by plants growing too close to the home</li>\n<li>Roof damage caused by downed tree branches</li>\n<li>Visitor injuries caused by blocked entryways, neglected steps, uneven walkways, or ungated pools</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>60% of burglars said the presence of a security alarm in a home would cause them to abandon that target.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"safetyupdatesdonthavetobreakthebank\">Safety updates don’t have to break the bank</h2>\n<p>While home safety measures usually require some investment – either of time or money – we’d like to make an argument for it. First, some security improvements can reduce your insurance bill, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Centrally monitored security systems</li>\n<li>Water detection and shut-off systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondly, these measures can prevent costly thefts and damage later on. Take a security system for starters. A <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/BurglarSurveyStudyFinalReport.pdf\">2012 study from UNC Charlotte</a> found about 60 percent of burglars said that the presence of an alarm in a home would cause them to abandon that target. It also found most burglars would try to determine if an alarm was present before attempting a burglary, which is why alarm signage and cameras can be a powerful deterrent.</p>\n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" xml=\"lang\" src=\"//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5cca0cdc3ba0f69f5a782bc5&t=3345d2c6d01fb93\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Though less prevalent than home security alarms, smart water detection systems are on the rise, and rightfully so. These are proof that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-smart-leak-detector/\">Sensors start at about $50</a>, but considering that even an inch of standing water in your basement can cost <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/average-cost-of-repairs-after-water-damage-4582172\">$4,000 for water removal alone</a>, you can imagine the savings if you are alerted to a leak well before it gets out of hand. That’s just one of the reasons Kin <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">partners with service providers</a> who make homes safer.

    body: "<p>Florida homeowners historically had few options when it came to flood insurance. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is expensive, restrictive, and often a last resort option.</p>\n<p>With nearly <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2019/07/24/533723.htm\">3.5 million people</a> at risk for coastal flooding in Florida, and only about half the folks in high-risk flood areas equipped with flood insurance, something had to change. Fortunately, <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">private flood insurance</a> is becoming more readily available. Here’s what you should know about the NFIP, private flood insurance, and how private flood insurance may benefit you – and your budget.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whythenationalfloodinsuranceprogramnfipisntenough\">Why the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) isn’t enough</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/national-flood-insurance-act-1968.pdf\">National Flood Insurance Act of 1968</a> created the NFIP, which is managed by the Federal Emergency Management System (FEMA). The program was the result of too few private flood insurance carriers and an increase in federal assistance for flood disasters. The program’s goals are threefold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide flood insurance.</li>\n<li>Improve floodplain management.</li>\n<li>Map flood hazard zones.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The NFIP has more than <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fema_NFIP_National-Flood-Insurance-Program-Fact-Sheet_May-2016.pdf\">5.1 million policies</a> in force, but providing flood insurance to homeowners was never one of its goals. Its primary aim was to improve floodplain management and mapping, and to that end, the program has been successful.</p>\n<p>The NFIP maps flood zones based on historical data to predict <a href=\"/glossary/100-year-floodplain/\">100-year flood risk</a>. That doesn’t mean a flood will only happen every 100 years in a given area. It means according to historical data, there is a 1 percent chance of a major flood occurring, but floods can (and do) happen more frequently.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the NFIP categorizes flood zones and their risks.</p>\n<p>| Flood Zone | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| B &amp; X (shaded) | Area of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of the 100‐ year and 500‐year floods. B Zones are also used to designate base floodplains of lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from 100‐year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than one foot or drainage areas less than 1 square mile. |\n| C &amp; X (unshaded) | Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depicted on FIRMs as above the 500‐year flood level. Zone C may have ponding and local drainage problems that don't warrant a detailed study or designation as base floodplain. Zone X is the area determined to be outside the 500‐year flood and protected by levee from 100‐year flood. |\n| A | Areas with a 1% annual chance of flooding and a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30‐year mortgage. Because detailed analyses are not performed for such areas; no depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. |\n| AE | The base floodplain where base flood elevations are provided. AE Zones are now used on new format FIRMs instead of A1‐A30 Zones. |\n| A1 - 30 | These are known as numbered A Zones (e.g., A7 or A14). This is the base floodplain where the FIRM shows a BFE (old format). |\n| AH | Areas with a 1% annual chance of shallow flooding, usually in the form of a pond, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30‐year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. |\n| AO | River or stream flood hazard areas, and areas with a 1% or greater chance of shallow flooding each year, usually in the form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from 1 to 3 feet. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30‐year mortgage. Average flood depths derived from detailed analyses are shown within these zones. |\n| AR | Areas with a temporarily increased flood risk due to the building or restoration of a flood control system (such as a levee or a dam). Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements will apply, but rates will not exceed the rates for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built or restored in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. |\n| A99 | Areas with a 1% annual chance of flooding that will be protected by a Federal flood control system where construction has reached specified legal requirements. No depths or base flood elevations are shown within these zones. |\n| V | Coastal areas with a 1% or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30‐year mortgage. No base flood elevations are shown within these zones. |\n| VE, V1 - 30 | Coastal areas with a 1% or greater chance of flooding and an additional hazard associated with storm waves. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30‐year mortgage. Base flood elevations derived from detailed analyses are shown at selected intervals within these zones. |\n| D | Areas with possible but undetermined flood hazards. No flood hazard analysis has been conducted. Flood insurance rates are commensurate with the uncertainty of the flood risk. |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fema-flood-zone-definitions.pdf\"><em>SNCO.us</em></a></p>\n<p>The rating system the NFIP created made it easier for private flood insurance companies to accurately price coverage based on the home’s proximity to water, elevation, and other hazards. But its coverage was not enough.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limitationsofthenfippolicy\">Limitations of the NFIP policy</h3>\n<p>While the NFIP has kept many homeowners from being completely uninsured for floods, its coverage is often too limited for the needs of most homeowners. For starters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage doesn’t start until 30 days after the application is accepted by NFIP.</li>\n<li>Dwelling limits are capped at $250,000 regardless of the home’s actual rebuild cost (the <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/\">average rebuild cost</a> in the US is between $108,768 and $457,876).</li>\n<li>Contents coverage is limited to $100,000 regardless of how much personal property you have.</li>\n<li>Deductibles start at $1,000, and your personal property and dwelling have <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/terms\">separate deductibles</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dissatisfaction wasn’t enough to pave the way for private flood insurers to enter the market, though. It took some regulatory changes to really put those gears in motion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theriseofprivatefloodinsurance\">The rise of private flood insurance</h2>\n<p>What took so long for private insurance to come along?</p>\n<p>The issue was twofold: floods are hard to predict, and federal regulations prevented private insurers from offering flood coverage to homes with federally regulated mortgages.</p>\n<p>Private insurers were slow to enter the market because there wasn’t a reliable way to measure flood risk. In recent years, they’ve developed sophisticated models to help predict, underwrite, and rate flood risk.</p>\n<p>Federally regulated lenders also couldn’t accept private flood insurance for homes in certain flood zones that are required to have flood coverage. It took until <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-flood-insurance\">2019 for federal regulators</a> to make it possible for these lenders to accept private flood insurance. The caveat is the coverage must be comparable to NFIP policies or better.</p>\n<p>Regulators decided to ease regulations in the hopes of helping people get affordable coverage so they don’t have to supplement with federal aid after natural disasters. After Hurricane Harvey, 738,000 people registered with FEMA for assistance, and it paid out $378 million for <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">flood damage</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, it seems capitalism is working for consumers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howprivatefloodinsurersareimprovingfloodinsurance\">How private flood insurers are improving flood insurance</h2>\n<p>After decades of floods besieging US coastal communities, 120 private flood insurers have stepped up to offer flood insurance as of 2018. In Florida, <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2020/02/20/floridas-private-flood-insurance-market-is-growing/\">31 private flood insurance</a> companies cover homes.</p>\n<p>Private flood insurers are helping drive down insurance costs in a couple key ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>More competition in the flood insurance market helps reduce costs.</li>\n<li>More insurers helps spread out the economic risk so one insurer or program isn’t saddled with all the claims.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Private flood coverage may cost as little as $500 a year for Florida homeowners, depending on their flood zone. If <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">more people have flood insurance</a>, it furthers drives down costs for everyone – another benefit of making the coverage affordable.</p>\n<p>Compare that to NFIP premiums, which vary drastically. The chart below shows average premium based on elevation, deductible, and property characteristics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/screen-shot-2021-01-13-at-11-13-10-am.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"NFIP Annual Premium for House in AE Zone\" /></p>\n<p><em>*Base flood elevation. Source:</em> <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/RFF-PB-16-10.pdf\"><em>RFF.org</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofprivatefloodinsurance\">The benefits of private flood insurance</h2>\n<p>Because standard home insurance policies don’t offer flood coverage, private flood insurance allows Florida homeowners to safeguard their homes and fill this gap in their coverage.</p>\n<p>And if you work with us, we make it super easy to add flood insurance to your policy as an endorsement so you pay one premium and one deductible for both your home and flood insurance. Taking on an NFIP policy means you have to pay two premiums for the two separate policies (one for your home insurance, one for flood).</p>\n<p>Some additional perks of our flood insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased dwelling protection</strong>: Unlike the NFIP limit of $250,000, Kin policies match the coverage of your homeowners dwelling coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>No waiting period</strong>: Our coverage is effective immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>No elevation certificate</strong>: We don’t require an elevation certificate, but you can submit one for a better discount.</li>\n<li><strong>No separate flood deductible</strong>: Your AOP deductible applies to flood claims.</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonal home coverage</strong>: We don’t charge extra for flood insurance for a vacation home, unlike the NFIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting flood protection has never been easier.

    body: "<p>The type of siding you have on your home dramatically affects its curb appeal, but how it looks shouldn’t be your only consideration. Some house siding options are better suited for certain climates, are more durable, or cost less than others. Another issue to keep in mind? The general aesthetic of your neighborhood</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of factors to weigh, so let’s look at the pros and cons of some of the most common exterior siding options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stuccosiding\">Stucco Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-stucco.jpg\" alt=\"House with white stucco siding\" title=\"Stucco siding works well in dry climates.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Stucco siding works well in dry climates.</small></i></p>\n<p>Stucco is a popular exterior siding option for many <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">styles of homes</a>. It mixes cement with sand or lime, and homeowners love it because its clean look and ability to be tinted in many colors. Stucco is best used in areas where there isn’t a substantial rainy season. The material's porous nature can cause it to saturate in more damp climates.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of stucco is up to 80 years, but it can crumble. And while the materials are inexpensive, installation is labor intensive and drives the expense up. Stucco siding costs around $7 to $9 per square foot, and re-stuccoing a home adds about $1 per square foot for removing the old stucco.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vinylsiding\">Vinyl Siding</h2>\n<p>Vinyl siding is fabricated from PVC plastics and can last up to 60 years. Unlike some other house siding options, vinyl doesn't rot or flake, and it can keep your home cooler during summer months because it reflects the sun’s rays. However, vinyl siding may fade and crack, an it can even melt in extreme heat. Plus, the manufacturing process raises environmental concerns for many homeowners.</p>\n<p>Builders use vinyl siding because it is less expensive to purchase and install. Insulated varieties cost anywhere from $4 to $12 per square foot, and non-insulated only typically cost $3.50 to $8 per square foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"woodclapboardsiding\">Wood Clapboard Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-wood-clapboard.jpg\" alt=\"Contemporary home with wood clapboard siding\" title=\"Wood clapboard siding can work well with contemporary styles\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Wood clapboard siding can work well with contemporary styles</small></i></p>\n<p>Wood clapboard siding consists of overlapping horizontal wood boards. This pattern is not only attractive, but it prevents moisture from collecting beneath them. Additionally, homeowners can stain or paint the siding to customize the look. Wood clapboard is a good insulator, though homeowners need to be concerned with warping and pest infestation.</p>\n<p>This is a more expensive exterior siding option, costing anywhere from $6 to $10 per square foot depending on where you live. Currently, <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber prices are sky high</a> - even after a recent tumble - so wood clapboard may be especially expensive right now. This cost, however, is counteracted with routine maintenance that can help clapboard last centuries. Without maintenance, the wood can rot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stoneveneersiding\">Stone Veneer Siding</h2>\n<p>Stone veneers give homes a rustic look, but the quality of stone veneers ranges widely. Some clearly look manufactured rather than like real slate or limestone. However, stone veneer siding is more fire resistant than wood-based siding options and protects your home from harsh weather. Stone is also a good insulator because the material absorbs heat and releases it slowly to help regulate the temperature in your home.</p>\n<p>Because they last up to 70 years without much maintenance, stone veneers are a fairly durable and convenient siding option. The cost of stone veneer siding is anywhere from $5.50 to $10.75 per square foot in most areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brickandbrickveneersiding\">Brick and Brick Veneer Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-brick.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of a red brick house\" title=\"Brick is one of the most durable house siding options available.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Brick is one of the most durable house siding options available.</small></i></p>\n<p>Many people like the look of brick siding, but it’s also known for its durability. Real brick can last for more than a century with little to no maintenance. When brick does need maintenance, it usually involves re-mortaring deteriorating joints.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of brick is that it's fire resistant and keeps homeowners safe. Plus, it offers decent insulation, particularly if you go with brick veneer. The cost, however, is another matter. Solid brick walls can cost upwards of $50 per square foot. Brick veneer doesn’t last as long as, but it’s about significantly less expensive than brick, costing $4 to $10 per square foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fibercementsiding\">Fiber Cement Siding</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot to like about fiber cement siding: it’s fireproof, termite-proof, durable, easily maintained, and aesthetically versatile. You can get fiber cement siding that looks like wood, stucco, or masonry, and it can last up to 50 years. It’s also inexpensive, costing between $5 and $14 per square foot for cement fiber siding.</p>\n<p>However, this type of siding has some disadvantages. For one, manufacturers often used asbestos to make it, so owners of older homes may need to cover their cement fiber with a new, more modern siding. Fiber cement siding is also not a great insulator, although it does a good job of protecting the layers of insulation under it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boardandbattensiding\">Board-and-Batten Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-board-batten.jpg\" alt=\"Modern white farmhouse with board-and-batten siding\" title=\"Boad-and-batten siding helps homes look taller.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Boad-and-batten siding helps homes look taller.</small></i></p>\n<p>Unlike wood clapboard, board-and-batten siding runs vertically, not horizontally. This design feature helps smaller buildings look taller. The wood, usually pine, is a good insulator on its own, but there’s usually a layer of rigid foam insulation beneath the boards. It should last 25 years or more but does require maintenance to prevent rot and pest infestation. Installation costs range from $2.25 to $12.50 per square foot including materials and labor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"seamlesssteelsiding\">Seamless Steel Siding</h2>\n<p>Seamless steel siding has several advantages over other house siding options. The first is aesthetics. Each panel of siding is customized to fit the entire length of your home, so you don’t see any splices. Steel siding is also fire resistant and low maintenance. While it expands and contracts with changing weather conditions, the effect is minimal, so you shouldn’t see a lot of warping or cracking. Plus, seamless steel costs just $3 to $6 per square foot.</p>\n<p>On the downside, seamless steel siding is difficult to install. And once you’ve got it up, you’re going to be stuck with whatever color you’ve picked for the next 20 years or so. This also isn’t the best exterior siding option if you’re on the coast. High winds can increase the holes around the fasteners, which can ultimately cause the siding to fail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cedarshinglesiding\">Cedar Shingle Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-cedar.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of the stonework and cedar siding on the entrance of a contempory home\" title=\"Cedar siding is beautiful but requires routine maintenance.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Cedar siding is beautiful but requires routine maintenance.</small></i></p>\n<p>In cedar shingle and shake siding, precisely milled cedar is layered in an overlapping pattern to reduce moisture accumulation. Both types of siding look wonderful in wooded surroundings, especially if you choose to stain rather than paint it. You can expect cedar shakes and shingles to cost anywhere from $6 to $15 per square foot depending on where you live.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawback to cedar shingle siding is maintenance. Shakes can last up to 30 years, but you’ll likely need to replace rotted or flaking shingles within 15 years. You’ll also have to be cognizant of pests that can damage and destroy the cedar shingle siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"engineeredwoodsiding\">Engineered Wood Siding</h2>\n<p>Engineered wood siding, also called wood composite, is a durable but affordable home siding option. It usually costs less than $9.00 per square foot for installation and lasts between 20 and 30 years in most parts of the country.</p>\n<p>Engineered wood is made of wood products and other materials that are easy to maintain and provide decent insulation. While it doesn’t look exactly like wood, it can have a more natural appearance than vinyl or metal siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aluminumsiding\">Aluminum Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/house-siding-options-aluminum.jpg\" alt=\"Ranch home with aluminum siding\" title=\"Aluminum siding is popular for its affordability and durability.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Aluminum siding is popular for its affordability and durability.</small></i></p>\n<p>Aluminum siding is another affordable house siding option that’s more environmentally friendly than vinyl siding. Because it is metal, it is not a good insulator on its own, but it’s usually sold with insulation. It has a long life span, lasting 50 years or more with little maintenance required. In fact, aluminum siding is popular along the coast because it resists rust. However, it's likely to suffer dents. A homeowner can expect to pay anywhere from $3 to $6 per square foot for aluminum siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"corrugatedmetalsiding\">Corrugated Metal Siding</h2>\n<p>Often considered industrial, corrugated metal siding has a long lifespan - 50 years or longer - with little maintenance. Metal doesn’t offer quality insulation, but it is fireproof and pest-proof. It costs approximately $3 to $7 per square foot to install corrugated metal siding.</p>\n<p>Cost is an important factor when you’re working through your house siding options. But remember, the per square foot price is just part of that consideration. Siding that lasts longer or that requires less maintenance can actually come out cheaper in the long run.</p>"

    body: "<p>Your household budget doesn’t have to be complicated. A functional household budget simply accounts for money that comes in and money that goes out. That can be as simple as dedicating 50 percent of your money toward needs, 30 percent toward wants, and 20 percent for savings or debt repayment.</p>\n<p>Making a budget – and sticking to it – is one way to make sure you can handle emergency expenses, like small repairs or vet bills. That’s super important considering most Americans can’t afford a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/20/heres-why-so-many-americans-cant-handle-a-400-unexpected-expense.html\">$400 emergency expense</a>.</p>\n<p>Using a worksheet is a good start. It helps you to identify how you’re spending your money and ways you can reallocate your money. A good budget worksheet helps identify what your needs are and what your wants are. By identifying what is a necessity and what isn’t, you can start to access how your discretionary spending affects your monthly budget to make adjustments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourhouseholdbudgetworksheet\">Your Household Budget Worksheet</h2>\n<p>We showed you how to make a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-budget-after-buying-a-house/\">budget after buying a house</a>, but now let’s take it one step further and build that budget.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/household-budget-worksheet.pdf\">Get Your Household Budget Worksheet</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"step1bepreparedtoconfrontyourfinances\">Step 1: Be Prepared to Confront Your Finances</h2>\n<p>The first step to making a reasonable budget is to take a cold, hard look at your finances. If you’re like many folks, you may have been avoiding a budget because it can be hard to confront how much you spend versus how much you make.</p>\n<p>The only way to trim the fat off your budget is to take an honest assessment of what you spend money on. Chances are you can’t change how much money you make, so you’ll need to make spending adjustments.</p>\n<p>When you bought your home, your lender probably calculated your <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/ratio-debt-calculator.aspx#:~:text=Lenders%20typically%20say%20the%20ideal,be%2036%20percent%20or%20lower.&text=For%20conventional%20loans%20backed%20by,as%20high%20as%2050%20percent.\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI). This divides your monthly debt payments by your monthly income. As a general rule, your housing DTI (which includes your monthly mortgage payment, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and HOA dues) should be 28 percent of your income or less. Your total DTI (the portion of your income needed to cover all of your monthly debts, plus mortgage payments and housing expenses) shouldn’t be more than 36 percent.</p>\n<p>This can help you understand your high-level budget, but it doesn’t tell you much about your discretionary spending. This is where the worksheet will help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step2gatherthedata\">Step 2: Gather the Data</h2>\n<p>Now is not the time to guesstimate. Before you sit down with this household budget worksheet, grab your recent paystubs, bank statements, credit card statements, and utility bills. Some things to keep in mind when sitting down with your finances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t count overtime pay unless it’s regular and consistent.</li>\n<li>Look at bank and credit card statements for discretionary spending on things like coffee, eating out, and clothing.</li>\n<li>Add up ATM withdrawals for things you spend cash on.</li>\n<li>Have several months of utility bills to get the average cost. Winter and summer utility bills can vary drastically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step3calculateyourtotalmonthlyincome\">Step 3: Calculate Your Total Monthly Income</h2>\n<p>Before you can decide how much to spend every month, you need to know how much you make. Start with your take-home pay, and then include other income sources: consistent side hustles, alimony or child support, or any other regular fixed income that you get. Tally them up to get your total income.</p>\n<p>Your earnings should dictate your budget, but if you’re like more than half Americans, you may be spending more than you earn every month. Again, that’s where this worksheet can help.</p>\n<p>| Monthly Income |\n| --- |\n| Source |\n| Wages |\n| Child Support |\n| Other |\n| Total Income |</p>\n<h2 id=\"step4addupyournecessarylivingexpenses\">Step 4: Add Up Your Necessary Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>Your fixed monthly expenses are necessities like your mortgage, property taxes, car payments, and insurance. Your variable expenses are necessities that may change in price from month to month, like your electric bill, gas expenses, and groceries.</p>\n<p>If you come across a category that doesn’t apply, put a zero in the field.</p>\n<p>| Living Expenses |\n| --- |\n| Fixed Necessities |\n| Mortgage |\n| Car Payment |\n| Home Insurance |\n| Car Insurance |\n| Cell Phone |\n| Internet |\n| Other |\n| Variable Necessities |\n| Water |\n| Electricity |\n| Gas |\n| Food |\n| Fuel |\n| Other |\n| Total Monthly Living Expenses |</p>\n<h2 id=\"step5takestockofyourdiscretionaryspending\">Step 5: Take Stock of Your Discretionary Spending</h2>\n<p>Discretionary spending is the money you spend on things that you don’t need but that make life more enjoyable, like recreation and entertainment. It could be conveniences like dining out or grabbing a Starbucks coffee on the way to work. You may need to visit your bank and credit card statements to get an accurate reflection of what your leisure spending looks like.</p>\n<p>If you use cash, make your best estimate at first. Track your spending for about a week to get an impression of where your cash spend goes.</p>\n<p>If you’re trying to rein in your expenses, monitor your discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>| Discretionary Spending |\n| --- |\n| Laundry |\n| Donations |\n| Clothing |\n| Entertainment |\n| Home Entertainment Subscriptions |\n| Dining Out / Takeout |\n| Coffee |\n| Rideshares |\n| Other |\n| Total Monthly Discretionary Expenses |</p>\n<h2 id=\"step6totalyoursavingsanddebtrepayment\">Step 6: Total Your Savings and Debt Repayment</h2>\n<p>Your savings take the biggest hit when discretionary spending isn’t under control. Ideally, 20 percent of your income should go toward savings. As you build your budget and monitor your spending, make adjustments to your discretionary spending so you can save more or pay off debts.</p>\n<p>| Savings and Debt Repayment |\n| --- |\n| Emergency Fund |\n| Retirement Savings |\n| College Savings |\n| Credit Card Payments |\n| Student Loan Payments |\n| Other |\n| Total Monthly Expenses |</p>\n<h2 id=\"step7setamonthlyremindertoreviewandadjust\">Step 7: Set a Monthly Reminder to Review and Adjust</h2>\n<p>Budgets are rarely a set-and-forget project. They need attention, review, and tweaks to make sure they work for you and your household.</p>\n<p>Set a calendar reminder in your phone to review your budget at the end of each month. Did you pay off some debt? Where did you spend the most? Did you splurge on clothes or dining out? You’ll start to see patterns of behavior that you can adjust if you aren’t happy with your currently financial reality.</p>\n<p>Making a budget isn’t about not spending on things you enjoy. It’s about understanding your habits and finding opportunities to better prioritize your money.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/household-budget-worksheet.pdf\">Get your complete home budget worksheet here</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Anyone who went house hunting last year knows what it’s like to deal with a seller’s market. The combination of low interest rates and low housing inventory pushed demand up and the competition for available homes fierce. Will that pattern continue? We looked at experts’ housing market predictions for 2022 to see what’s in store.</p>\n<h2 id=\"itsstillasellersmarket\">It’s Still a Seller’s Market</h2>\n<p>Early housing market predictions from economists indicated that 2022 would continue to be a seller’s market, although not at the pace we saw in 2021. In January, Chief Economist Lawrence Yun from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/10/2022-housing-market-predictions\">predicted home sales would decline</a> slightly, but stay above pre-pandemic numbers. Experts at Zillow made <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-2022-housing-predictions-30394\">similar predictions</a>, saying certain metrics would stick, namely low housing inventory, high demand, and low mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"housinginventorywillseemodestgrowth\">Housing Inventory Will See Modest Growth</h2>\n<p>The supply chain issues that push up prices at the gas pump also impact the cost of building materials, as shown by last year’s <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">skyrocketing lumber costs</a>. According to Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), problems with the supply chain, and therefore inflation and the pace of construction, <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/blog/2022/02/housing-affordability-will-remain-a-significant-challenge-in-2022\">will continue into 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking at these supply chain issues next to significant labor shortages in the construction industry led Dietz to predict limited growth in single-family home production this year. However, multi-family home starts may help pick up the slack for an overall increase of 2.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Mike Gregor of the <a href=\"https://www.sellitmike.com/\">Cohen Agency</a> thinks he’s already seen some growth in the housing supply. “Real estate market sale listings have been increasing for five consecutive months.” This could ease the competition for each home down even though the market as a whole benefits sellers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mortgagerateswillcontinuetorise\">Mortgage Rates Will Continue to Rise</h2>\n<p>Low mortgage rates, <a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart\">averaging 2.65 percent</a> for a 30-year mortgage, were a major factor in 2021’s hot real estate market. So when most Federal Reserve members predicted at least <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/the-majority-of-fed-members-forecast-three-interest-rate-hikes-in-2022-to-fight-inflation.html\">three interest rate hikes</a> back in December, economists factored that into their housing market predictions for 2022, saying rising mortgage rates would put a damper on sales.</p>\n<p>You may have not noticed any difference if you were looking to purchase a home in the first few months of 2022. That’s partly because many people dove into the market hoping to buy before mortgage rates started going up. As of April 14, 2021, the average for a 30-year fixed mortgage was <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US\">5 percent</a>. That may not be a historic low, but it’s still much better than previous years.</p>\n<p>Experts still predict that mortgage rates will continue to rise, and that impacts the overall cost of a home. As Patrick O’Sullivan, the owner of <a href=\"https://www.getmultifamily.com/\">Get MULTIfamily</a>, explains, “The higher our mortgage rates, the higher your overall mortgage payments. That means higher monthly costs for you.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"buyingahousein2022\">Buying a House in 2022</h2>\n<p>When you look at housing market predictions for 2022, the year looks like a mixed bag. Sellers still have the upper hand, but experts anticipate some of the pressures that push prices higher will ease ﹘ but slowly, and maybe not until 2023.</p>\n<p>That said, if a new home is part of your 2022 plans, then you’re going to want to keep a close eye on the markets where you hope to buy. You may have fewer options to choose from, so you’ll want to move quickly when you find a home that meets your needs. Pay attention to mortgage rates too. Most experts expect them to keep going up, which is another reason you may need to move quickly.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important tip for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a house in a seller’s market</a> is to think carefully about your budget. Offers above the asking price may be the norm for a while longer, and new homebuyers are often surprised by the additional costs, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, appraisal fees, and property taxes.</p>\n<p>Get more budgeting tips in our article “<a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">13 Ways to Afford a House</a>.”</p>"

    body: "<p>Sad but true: when the government screeches to a halt, homeowners may feel the effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"governmentshutdownsimpacthomeloansinsuranceandfederalaid\">Government Shutdowns Impact Home Loans, Insurance, and Federal Aid</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot of news out there about what happens during a government shutdown. But we’re interested in how it could affect homeowners and those in the process of buying a home. For now, assume everything in here applies to the ongoing partial government shutdown of 2019 that started in December 2018; if we update this post to address future shutdowns, we’ll make note of that here.</p>\n<p>There are several government services relevant to homeowners that could be impacted by a government shutdown. We’ll look at the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Government-backed mortgage loans (FHA, USDA, and VA)</li>\n<li>Mortgage underwriting supported by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</li>\n<li>NFIP <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a></li>\n<li>FEMA disaster recovery aid</li>\n<li>HUD-backed home improvement loans</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"effectofagovernmentshutdownonmortgageloans\">Effect of a Government Shutdown on Mortgage Loans</h2>\n<p>The federal government provides two main types of assistance for mortgages: loan insurance and actual mortgage loans. Both may be affected by the ongoing 2019 government shutdown.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fhamortgageloans\">FHA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) makes it easier for some first-time homebuyers to get a mortgage by offering <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>. An FHA-backed loan typically requires less money down than a standard loan. To mitigate the lender’s risk, the FHA supplies insurance on the loan (which the borrower pays for, typically wrapped into their monthly mortgage payments).</p>\n<p>As of now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FHA-backed loans for single-family residences are still being financed.</li>\n<li>FHA home equity conversion mortgages (also called “reverse mortgages”) are NOT being financed.</li>\n<li>FHA Title I loans for home improvement projects are NOT being financed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>So if you’re looking for an FHA-backed mortgage to buy a home, you should still be able to secure it during the government shutdown.</strong></p>\n<p>There are two big caveats here, though: first, while the FHA is still operating, it is not currently fully staffed, so securing a loan may take more time than usual because <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/list/the-shutdowns-impact-on-financial-services\">backlogs are forming</a>.</p>\n<p>Second: there’s more to buying a home than securing a mortgage. Read on for how the shutdown might affect government branches responsible for mortgage-adjacent duties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vamortgageloans\">VA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also offers mortgage guarantees – in this case for those who have served or are serving in the military. As of this writing, <a href=\"https://www.veteransunited.com/valoans/government-shutdown-impact-va-home-loans/\">VA-backed loans are still available to eligible borrowers</a>.</p>\n<p>As with FHA loans, though, system backlogs may mean these loans will take longer than usual to secure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usdamortgageloans\">USDA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>USDA loans, sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and available to low- and middle-income Americans in rural areas, are <strong>NOT</strong> being processed during the shutdown. While homebuyers can still apply for USDA loans, their applications won’t be processed until Trump signs a bill renewing appropriations (money) for the USDA.</p>\n<p>If you were approved for a USDA loan but haven’t yet actually finalized your home purchase, you may be out of luck, especially if you’ve already spent money on appraisals and <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-4-point-insurance-inspection/\">inspections</a>. If you’re not sure of your loan’s status, consult with your lender.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rippleeffectsofgovernmentshutdownonmortgagelending\">Ripple Effects of Government Shutdown on Mortgage Lending</h2>\n<p>The takeaway from the above section is that the 2019 government shutdown will not <em>directly</em> affect most people’s mortgage loans.</p>\n<p>But it may have some indirect effects.</p>\n<p>Consider the warning that Moody’s Investor Service <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/Pages/rr005_0.aspx?bd=005006&ed=&rd=005006%7C004003%7C007035&tb=5&po=0&sb=&sd=&lang=en&cy=global&kw=\">issued on January 10</a>, which proclaimed, “Government shutdown raises non-bank mortgage lenders’ exposure to mortgage delivery risk.”</p>\n<p>Essentially, the Moody’s argument is that, of the 800,000 federal workers currently furloughed, some were responsible for work related to originating and servicing mortgage loans. Without their work, lenders must find workarounds to verify certain lender information – something that’s part of evaluating the risk the lender takes on when lending money.</p>\n<p>These workarounds, Moody’s points out, are likely to be less reliable and more susceptible to fraud than the established standard methods, meaning that, even though lenders still <em>can</em> complete mortgage loans, they may be less motivated to do so given the higher risk exposure they now face.</p>\n<p>The shutdown may also cause a few other problems for homebuyers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delayed income verification.</strong> Usually, borrowers provide income verification to mortgage lenders with the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/f4506t.pdf\">4605-T form</a> (named for its place in the tax code), which is a request for a borrower’s tax return. The IRS is in charge of processing these forms and sending the tax returns to mortgage lenders. While the IRS has been partially reopened since January 7, its employees face a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/01/09/irs-takes-steps-provide-tax-transcripts-other-services-during-government-shutdown/#d0586f865dae\">backlog of requests</a>. So while the income verification process usually takes about 72 hours, it could take much longer until the government reopens.</li>\n<li><strong>Delayed SSN verification.</strong> Mortgage lenders may also need to verify a borrower’s Social Security Number (SSN) as part of the mortgage underwriting process. Again, limited staffing at the SSA could lead to backlogs, which could delay the mortgage lending process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/bll1901.pdf\">Fannie Mae</a> issued guidelines in early January for mortgage lenders during the shutdown. Essentially, both groups (which purchase mortgages from lenders and repackage them into mortgage-backed securities to create greater liquidity in the lending market) said it’s still okay to continue issuing mortgage loans, but lenders (and therefore borrowers) should expect the process to take longer than usual.</p>\n<p>Again, though, there’s a big caveat: both groups noted that their guidelines were meant only for a short-term shutdown. If the shutdown becomes a “long-term” affair (though neither group defines what counts as “long-term”), their guidelines may change.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on January 16, just five days after publishing its first guidelines, Fannie Mae issued updated <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/eligibility-matrix.pdf\">guidelines</a> – whichever amount is higher.</p>\n<p>In other words: thanks to the shutdown, it just got a little harder to secure a mortgage loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodinsuranceduringthegovernmentshutdown\">Flood Insurance During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"/blog/check-your-flood-risk/\">flood zone</a>, you probably already know that most lenders require you to have an active flood insurance policy in place in order to issue a loan. In many cases, lenders require that this insurance be provided by the <a href=\"/blog/what-happens-to-the-nfip-in-a-government-shutdown/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which operates as part of FEMA.</p>\n<p>The good news: the NFIP <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program/national-flood-insurance-program-reauthorization-guidance\">announced</a> on December 28, 2018, that <strong>it will be issuing new flood insurance policies and renewing existing policies through May 31, 2019</strong>, regardless of the status of the rest of the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: That’s a reversal of an earlier statement that the NFIP wouldn’t be issuing policies.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the NFIP isn’t exactly in the best shape right now. All kinds of folks have been calling for a revamp of the program, which is in more than $20 billion of debt. We’ll keep you posted here about how things shake out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femadisasterassistanceduringthegovernmentshutdown\">FEMA Disaster Assistance During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates disaster assistance to Americans impacted by disasters like <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> and wildfires. <strong>During the 2019 government shutdown, FEMA plans to continue delivering its disaster relief services</strong>, which is possible because they’re paid for from a fund that isn’t affected by the shutdown.</p>\n<p>If you need to apply for disaster assistance, go straight to <a href=\"https://www.disasterassistance.gov/\">DisasterAssistance.gov</a>, which will be fully operational during the shutdown.</p>\n<p>But while the most visible recovery efforts are moving forward, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/685880550/shutdown-threatens-to-stall-recovery-in-wildfire-ravaged-paradise-calif\">NPR has reported</a> that some other efforts have stalled. Disaster recovery grants funded by the Economic Development Administration (within the Department of Commerce), for example, are inaccessible. People can’t apply for them and money can’t be distributed.</p>\n<p>Another troubling development: prescribed burning work (meant to prevent future fires) has also been paused while federal workers are furloughed.</p>\n<p>While neither of these is causing much immediate pain, their long-term fallout could be significant for homeowners in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hudservicesduringthegovernmentshutdown\">HUD Services During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, 95 percent of workers in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are furloughed during the current shutdown. While HUD primarily provides services for renters, it also offers loans and grants to elderly and low-income homeowners who need to make home upgrades or repairs for safety or health reasons.</p>\n<p>EfficientGov has put together a comprehensive list of what to expect from <a href=\"https://efficientgov.com/blog/2019/01/09/hud-in-the-government-shutdown/\">HUD during the shutdown</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other2019governmentshutdownconsiderationsforhomeowners\">Other 2019 Government Shutdown Considerations for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/reports/federal-government-shutdown-survey\">survey</a> conducted by the National Association of Realtors found that about one in five realtors saw the government shutdown affecting either current or potential clients (i.e., current or future home buyers). Those effects are likely to worsen the longer the shutdown continues.</p>\n<p>If you are a government employee who isn’t receiving a paycheck right now, consider <strong>approaching your lender sooner rather than later</strong> if you think you may miss mortgage payments. Already, several banks and credit unions around the country have announced plans to offer low-cost loans to borrowers affected by the shutdown. Some may also offer forbearance plans.</p>\n<p>Obviously, none of these options are ideal, but getting in touch with your lender before you actually miss a payment is usually the best way to ensure that you don’t face any penalties.</p>\n<p>If you still have questions about your mortgage, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, mortgage insurance, HOA fees, or other home-related obligations during the shutdown, feel free to reach out (<a href=\"mailto:support@kin.com\">support@kin.com</a>).

    body: "<p>After Hurricane Harvey, flooding hit a lot of <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a> homeowners who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/houston-flood-zone-hurricane-harvey.html\">didn’t know they were in a floodplain</a> – or rather, it hit homeowners who’d been told their homes weren’t in floodplains. The water damage posed a major problem because many of these people didn’t carry <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Harvey’s damage, as well as the widespread <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">damage from hurricanes</a> Irma and Maria, has left people wondering how floodplains are determined for homeowners – and when a person should think about supplementing their homeowners insurance with flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inthebeginningfemasbasefloodmaps\">In the Beginning: FEMA’s “Base Flood” Maps</h2>\n<p>When the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) launched as a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (<a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">FEMA</a>) in 1968, its goal was to provide a more robust insurance system for flooding that affected houses. Part of this effort involved requiring homeowners to purchase NFIP flood insurance if they lived in what was designated a “flood zone.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who lives in a Special Flood Hazard Area is required to carry flood insurance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The NFIP considers a “flood zone” to be any area that has a one percent chance of flooding in any given year. This one-percent chance is more commonly referred to in terms of the “hundred-year flood,” a name that many consider confusing. In fact, to prevent any confusion, the NFIP doesn’t use the term “hundred-year flood;” instead, it uses “<a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/nfip_sg_unit_3.pdf\">base flood</a>.”</p>\n<p>If your house is located in a base flood zone (that is, in an area that has a one-percent chance of flooding in any given year), that zone is called a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Anyone who lives in an SFHA is required to carry flood insurance.</p>\n<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"inaccuratemapsinsufficientfundingandprivatehelp\">Inaccurate Maps, Insufficient Funding, and Private Help</h2>\n<p>The only problem was that the maps the NFIP used to determine who was in an SFHA were widely considered inaccurate. That was problematic for two major reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People living in SFHAs that were marked as “safe” weren’t required to buy flood insurance. When floods inevitably happened, the damage was wildly expensive.</li>\n<li>People living in “safe” areas incorrectly marked as SFHAs had to pay as much as 10 times what they should have for their flood insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was this second group who ended up making the biggest fuss about the incorrect maps. In the 1980s, enough citizens complained that the NFIP decided to let private parties submit changes to the flood maps. Ideally, the NFIP would have handled these changes itself, but the organization was already suffering from insufficient funding (today, it’s about $24.6 billion in debt. Yikes).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As many as 41 million people are at inland flooding risk, compared to the 13 million FEMA currently estimates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, a lot of submitted changes came from engineers working on behalf of private citizens who were tired of paying thousands of dollars for flood insurance they didn’t really need. But then developers realized that they could make some serious money by changing SFHAs to areas where it was safe to build (and sell) homes.</p>\n<p>While many of these changes were no doubt accurate, others were… well, less so. Reports suggest that in the Houston area in particular, developers were doing things like trucking in dirt to raise the elevation of land by a few inches, adding levees, digging water retention ponds, and more. The result was that the land could technically be considered out of an SFHA – but in reality, it was still susceptible to flooding from nearby water bodies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newfloodmapsbiggerrisks\">New Flood Maps, Bigger Risks?</h2>\n<p>The New York Times reports that more than 150,000 changes have been made to floodplain maps in the last five years, many proposed by private entities and approved by FEMA. But a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180228112520.htm\">study</a> published as recently as last month suggests that current maps could be seriously underestimating the number of <a href=\"/blog/flood-disclosure-laws/\">Americans at risk for flooding</a>.</p>\n<p>The reason: the new study mapped all of the continental United States, whereas the NFIP maps consider only 60 percent. With the entire landmass taken into account, as many as 41 million people are at inland flooding risk, compared to the 13 million FEMA currently estimates (both of these numbers ignore coastal flooding risks).</p>\n<h2 id=\"soshouldyougetfloodinsurance\">So… Should You Get Flood Insurance?</h2>\n<p>All this may be interesting, but it doesn’t necessarily answer the question of whether an individual homeowner should add flood insurance to their policy. If you’re on the fence, here are a few steps you can take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read through</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/homeowners-frequently-asked-questions\"><strong>FEMA’s FAQs on flood insurance</strong></a>. They cover a lot of practical ground.</li>\n<li><strong>Price out some flood insurance quotes</strong>. Even if you’re not legally required to have it, coverage may make sense given the way climate change is impacting the intensity of storms.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your home</strong>. Whether or not you’re in an SFHA, shoring up your property against the biggest local hazards makes sense.</li>\n</ol>"

    body: "<p>Hurricanes are named so that they are easy to remember and communicate. But it wasn’t always that way.</p>\n<p>Way back when, tropical storms were named after Catholic saints being honored on the day of the storm. For example, in 1825, the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico was named after Saint Anne.</p>\n<p>Storms from there were named pretty arbitrarily. A 1842 Atlantic storm was named <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/natural-hazards-and-disaster-risk-reduction/tropical-cyclones/Naming\">Antje’s hurricane</a> after it ripped off the mast of a boat by that name.</p>\n<p>Then early meteorologists in the US started naming storms by their latitude and longitude. Very scientific, but it doesn’t really roll off the tongue. Imagine trying to remember a string of numbers during the panic and confusion of an oncoming storm!</p>\n<p>The US also experimented with using the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\">phonetic alphabet for storms</a> (Able, Baker, Charlie), but that led to overlap and confusion.</p>\n<p>During World War II, inspired by George R. Stewart’s novel <em>Storm</em>, military meteorologists in the Pacific jokingly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tropical_cyclone_naming\">started naming storms after their wives and girlfriends</a>. While not the most flattering thing in the world, it turned out human names are much easier to remember.</p>\n<p>And the naming convention stuck. Hurricane names keep everyone on the same page during <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> and increase public awareness, from meteorologists, researchers, and emergency responders to reporters and citizens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdohurricanesgettheirnames\">How Do Hurricanes Get Their Names?</h2>\n<p>The National Weather Service started using women’s names for storms in 1953, and by 1978, both men and women’s names for Northern Pacific storms were in rotation (hooray, equality!). The system was so successful that by 1979, Atlantic storms got this naming convention, too.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/natural-hazards-and-disaster-risk-reduction/tropical-cyclones/Naming\">World Meteorological Organization now maintains a list of names</a> to use for storms. Women’s and men’s names alternate throughout the year in alphabetical order. There are 21 names each year, and names can be repeated after six years unless they are retired out of respect. So the 2020 hurricane names will be used again in 2026.</p>\n<p>WMO members of each region propose names for Atlantic and Eastern Pacific storms, and they’re approved each year. Some areas, like the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-cyclone/Naming-systems\">northern Indian Ocean</a>, give tropical cyclones numbers instead of names.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricanenamesinorder\">Hurricane Names in Order</h2>\n<p>Below are the 2020, 2021, and 2022 tropical storm names. If more than 21 tropical storms happen in any given year, the additional storms will take their names from the Greek alphabet in order: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi, and Omega.</p>\n<p>The last time we dipped into the Greek alphabet was in 2005 when the Atlantic had <a href=\"https://time.com/5696288/hurricane-names/\">27 recorded hurricanes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2021atlantichurricanenames\">2021 Atlantic Hurricane Names</h3>\n<p>Atlantic hurricane names are assigned in alphabetical order. None of the 21 names begin with Q, U, X, Y, or Z.</p>\n<p>The names this season are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ana</li>\n<li>Bill</li>\n<li>Claudette</li>\n<li>Danny</li>\n<li>Elsa</li>\n<li>Fred</li>\n<li>Grace</li>\n<li>Henri</li>\n<li>Ida</li>\n<li>Julian</li>\n<li>Kate</li>\n<li>Larry</li>\n<li>Mindy</li>\n<li>Nicholas</li>\n<li>Odette</li>\n<li>Peter</li>\n<li>Rose</li>\n<li>Sam</li>\n<li>Teresa</li>\n<li>Victor</li>\n<li>Wanda</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml\"><em>National Hurricane Center</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"2021easternnorthpacifichurricanenames\">2021 Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Names</h3>\n<p>Two centers assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization in the Eastern North Pacific: the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, depending on the direction of the storm. There are more Spanish names on the Eastern Pacific hurricanes list because these storms mostly threaten western Mexico and Central America. The list has 24 names but none that begin with Q or U.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Andres</li>\n<li>Blanca</li>\n<li>Carlos</li>\n<li>Dolores</li>\n<li>Enrique</li>\n<li>Felicia</li>\n<li>Guillermo</li>\n<li>Hilda</li>\n<li>Ignacio</li>\n<li>Jimena</li>\n<li>Kevin</li>\n<li>Linda</li>\n<li>Marty</li>\n<li>Nora</li>\n<li>Olaf</li>\n<li>Pamela</li>\n<li>Rick</li>\n<li>Sandra</li>\n<li>Terry</li>\n<li>Vivian</li>\n<li>Waldo</li>\n<li>Xina</li>\n<li>York</li>\n<li>Zelda</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml\"><em>National Hurricane Center</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"retiredhurricanenames\">Retired Hurricane Names</h2>\n<p>Names are retired from the WMO lists when a storm causes significant fatalities and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane damage</a>. It’s a small way to show respect to the folks who’ve lost a lot. So far, 89 names have been retired.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, Nate, Florence, and Michael have all been retired. Andrew and Katrina are also retired and won’t be used again. <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\">See the full list of retired names here</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the name Dorian was retired, and in 2020, Laura, Eta, and Iota were retired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoesastormgetaname\">When Does a Storm Get a Name?</h2>\n<p>When a tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean reaches 39 miles per hour in wind speed, it gets a name, like Tropical Storm Isaias. Once it reaches sustained winds of 74 miles per hour, it’s upgraded to hurricane status with that same name: Hurricane Isaias.</p>\n<p>Even if a tropical storm doesn’t become a hurricane, the name won’t be used again for six years. The next storm takes the next name on the list.</p>"

    body: "<p>Weather patterns are changing around the world, causing more frequent and severe storms and disasters. And these disasters have a real impact on homeowners.</p>\n<p>In 2019, we saw <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes\">18 named Atlantic Ocean storms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-wildfires\">50,477 wildfires</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/03/26/bomb-cyclone-colorado-strongest-storm/\">bomb cyclone</a> that hit the United States. The cost of natural disasters in 2019: <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-global-catastrophes\">$150 billion dollars</a>.</p>\n<p>No matter whether you believe that climate change is the direct result of human activity or the result of a natural evolutionary cycle, at the end of the day, it impacts every single person and being on this planet. Here's what homeowners across the US can expect and ways you can help prevent losses fueled by climate change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisclimatechange\">What is climate change?</h2>\n<p>Climate change is a long-term change in weather patterns caused by increasing temperatures on Earth. Increased greenhouse gases trapped by the atmosphere create a warmer surface. This warms water and ice sheets, leading to melting glaciers and an increase in water depths. It affects each area differently.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">areas prone to hurricanes</a>, we'll continue to see stronger storms thanks to warm moisture-filled air meeting cold water. Rising temperatures will cause even more droughts in other areas. Melting ice sheets and glaciers will cause oceans to rise faster, meaning <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">more floods</a> for coastal regions. And the Midwest will see an uptick in tornado activity.</p>\n<p>We've already seen these effects take shape. Flooding in the Southeast has increased <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/climate-change-ar.pdf\">27 percent since 1958</a> because of more rainfall. The West Coast is experiencing a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8227575/A-MEGADROUGHT-likely-emerge-southwest-North-America-driven-climate-change.html\">Megadrought</a> that began in 2000 and isn't letting up.</p>\n<p>While it's easy to feel defeated in the face of a worldwide issue, you can take some steps to protect your home. That begins with understanding how climate change might directly affect you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscanexpectfromclimatechange\">What homeowners can expect from climate change</h2>\n<p>Whether it's rainfall, rising oceans, wildfires, or tornado activity, climate change will impact both your home and <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. These are some key changes to anticipate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More risk</strong>. The average Florida home is <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/news/the-future-is-now-for-sea-level-rise-in-south-florida\">six feet above sea level</a> with many at three feet. Under normal conditions, many Florida communities are already at risk for flooding because they are low to the ground and because of poor drainage systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased home insurance premiums</strong>. Premiums for <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> are based on known risks. The closer someone lives to the coast or forested area, the more expensive insurance becomes because the risk of loss is higher.</li>\n<li><strong>Fewer coverage options</strong>. More than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/business/california-fires-insurance.html\">1.7 million of California’s 8 million homes</a> are prone to wildfire damage. Many insurance companies are responding to increase wildfire risk by refusing to cover homes in “wildfire zones.”</li>\n<li><strong>Declining home values</strong>. The Florida housing market for beach properties could be in jeopardy, too. The $3.5 billion worth of coastal property in the area <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2017/04/20/448504.htm\">could see a dramatic drop</a> if waters rise and inland canals are too high to allow boat masts to clear bridges. Mortgage companies could potentially stop writing loans in the area and prices could plummet – and that's without a hurricane hitting the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last point is significant – climate change's long-term effects on the real estate market won't be limited to Florida. Fewer buyers may be willing invest in homes that are hard to insure because of their flood or wildfire exposure.</p>\n<p>Some estimate that Florida coastal homes could see a <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2020/01/17/your-florida-coastal-home-could-lose-15-of-its-value-by-2030-due-to-sea-rise/\">15 percent drop in value by 2030</a> thanks, in part, to rising sea levels. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2017/04/20/448504.htm\">President Obama’s administration</a> provided $48 million in funding for a Louisiana town that was sinking into the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, the risk in Florida, with its sizable coastal population, means that a federal bailout is unlikely.</p>\n<p>California real estate agents know the struggle to sell a home in a wildfire zone; buyers can make an <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/article233012587.html\">offer on a home only to withdraw it</a> when insurance is unattainable. This is affecting homes in small rural areas as well as in newly developed communities.</p>\n<p>However, homeowners can take some measures to protect themselves as the climate invariably continues to warm and risks continue to increase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscandotoprepareforclimatechange\">What homeowners can do to prepare for climate change</h2>\n<p>You know climate change isn't going anywhere, but you don't want your home to be a sitting duck. You're not alone. Here are some ways every homeowner can start planning ahead:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Buy the right homeowners insurance</strong>. Make sure you are covered for flood, wildfires, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Not every insurance policy covers every peril, so do your due diligence to get the right coverage. <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane home insurance</a> comes standard with all Kin policies; <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> and earthquake insurance must be added on.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate your home’s surrounding landscape</strong>. If you live near open spaces, make sure you clear brush regularly and maintain defensible space. Some counties require a minimum of 30 feet clearance. A no-brush barrier of 100 feet provides more protection from wildfires.</li>\n<li><strong>Check out</strong> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780373013/how-virtual-reality-can-help-people-better-understand-climate-change\"><strong>virtual reality programs</strong></a>. These walk you through changes in the topography of your community to determine what mitigation systems may help (e.g., sea walls, raised homes, or better drainage systems).</li>\n<li><strong>Consider migrating inland</strong>. If you plan on moving to a coastal region like Florida, consider property farther inland and at a higher elevation.</li>\n<li><strong>Get involved</strong>. Speak up about rising sea levels at your town halls or city councils. Ask city officials to take measures to fortify beaches, improve city sea walls, and improve drainage systems throughout the area.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"5waystofortifyyourhomeforclimatechange\">5 ways to fortify your home for climate change</h2>\n<p>Improving your home's resilience to climate change reduces the chance and severity of major damage (and subsequent claims). These are five ways to prepare your home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Elevate and anchor equipment and systems in flood zones</strong>. Water heaters, gas tanks, and air conditioning units should be above your property’s flood level and anchored to prevent movement. Move all sockets, switches, and circuit breakers to higher levels. It's smart to keep sockets at least one foot above an anticipated flood level.</li>\n<li><strong>Modify water valves</strong>. Install backflow valves both inside and outside all pipes that lead into the house. This helps prevent water backup from city sewers and plumbing from overtaking the home’s internal pipe system.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess property drainage</strong>. Find the natural drainage pattern of your property. Update landscaping and downspouts that have pooling problems and make sure all water will flow away from the house rather than toward it.</li>\n<li><strong>Retrofit your home based on its risks</strong>. Flood retrofitting often means raising the home or installing foundation vents. Earthquake retrofitting reinforces the walls and overall structural integrity of your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Do regular</strong> <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\"><strong>home maintenance</strong></a>. Clear gutters, drains, and downspouts to improve drainage and mitigate flooding. Clear debris on and around the property and build a wildfire barrier if you are close to open space.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Homeowners may not be able to prevent every climate change claim but by taking smart measures, they take back some control over Mother Nature.</p>"

    body: "<p>Most homebuyers need a mortgage before they can afford a house. But like anyone who borrows money, people who take out a mortgage end up paying the amount they borrowed plus more in interest.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage interest can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Let’s take a closer look at how mortgage interest works on different loans and what might be the best option for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisamortgageinterestrate\">What is a mortgage interest rate?</h2>\n<p>A mortgage interest rate is what it costs you to borrow money so you can buy a home. Lenders typically charge a percentage of the principal amount, or the amount you’re borrowing, as interest. This is how they make money on your loan.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage interest rate is different from your annual percentage rate (APR). An APR includes your mortgage interest rate plus any discount points and broker fees. For this reason, your APR is often higher than your mortgage rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesinterestworkonamortgage\">How does interest work on a mortgage?</h2>\n<p>How mortgage interest works depends on the type of mortgage you get. Generally, you have three types of loans to choose from when you buy a home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed-rate mortgage</li>\n<li>Adjustable-rate mortgage</li>\n<li>Interest-only mortgage</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most common type is a fixed-rate mortgage followed by an adjustable-rate mortgage. Interest-only loans are much rarer than these and usually only given to homebuyers who are wealthy or who have irregular incomes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fixedinterestratemortgage\">Fixed-interest rate mortgage</h3>\n<p>A fixed-interest rate mortgage is one where your interest rate is set for the entire life of the loan. Mortgages typically last anywhere from 10 to 30 years, or even longer. Choosing a mortgage with a shorter term can increase your monthly payments because the loan needs to be repaid sooner, but your mortgage interest rates may be lower than it is on longer-term mortgages.</p>\n<p>Your monthly mortgage payment goes towards paying off your loan’s interest and principal. In the early months, a larger chunk of your payment goes towards your interest than to your principal. But as time passes, your principal decreases and accrues less interest. This means more of your monthly payment can go to paying off your principal.</p>\n<p>You should also note that while the mortgage interest on a fixed-rate loan doesn’t change, you may get a chance to <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinance your mortgage</a> at a different rate. This requires you to apply and requalify for the lower mortgage interest rate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjustableratemortgage\">Adjustable-rate mortgage</h3>\n<p>An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) does not permanently lock in your mortgage interest rate for the duration of your loan. Instead, the mortgage interest rates on ARMs can adjust as often as once per year, but most have limits on how often or how much they can adjust.</p>\n<p>Like a fixed-interest rate mortgage, ARMS can have a term of up to 30 years and your monthly payments go towards paying off your principal and your interest. Borrowers find ARMs attractive because they often start with a low interest rate that makes them more affordable in the early years. But you may find your monthly payments difficult to maintain as interest rates change.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid this trouble is to look at how often an ARMs adjusts. For example, the mortgage interest rate on a three-year ARM can adjust every three years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interestonlymortgage\">Interest-only mortgage</h3>\n<p>Unlike the monthly payment for ARMs and fixed-interest rate mortgages, the monthly payment for an interest-only mortgage only goes towards your interest at the start of the loan. This keeps your payments low for a set time. Once the interest-only period ends, you're responsible for paying both the principal and the interest.</p>\n<p>If you’re not planning on staying in the home for a long time, an interest-only mortgage can make it easier for you to afford a pricier home. However, this is still a risky mortgage to take on because you don’t build up equity until you start paying your principal. Worse? You can lose any equity you gained from your down payment if housing prices suddenly decline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howismortgageinterestcalculated\">How is mortgage interest calculated?</h2>\n<p>Lenders calculate mortgage interest by the month. To get a general idea of your monthly payment, you multiply the remaining principal on your loan by your interest rate and divide that resulting number by 12.</p>\n<p>If you want a more accurate estimate for your monthly mortgage interest, you can try one of the many mortgage calculators available online. This <a href=\"https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/\">mortgage calculator</a>mortgage calculator not only gives you an estimate for your monthly payment, but it also factors in other costs like <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, property taxes, and <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>The life span of your roof depends on the materials that it’s made from and how the climate impacts those materials. Some roofing materials are more resilient than others, but most people can expect approximately 10 to 15 years from a roof made of 3-tab shingles. More expensive materials such as slate can last up to 25 years, depending on maintenance and where you live.</p>\n<p>It's important to know the age of your roof because it impacts your home insurance premiums. The more life you have left in your roof, the lower your rates will usually be.</p>\n<p>That's because your roof offers key protection for the rest of your home from the elements. A <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof that needs to be replaced</a> can easily lead to losses from water intrusion –&nbsp;and more.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that insurance carriers in different regions sometimes have strict roof age requirements. For example, Florida's climate can shorten a roof's lifespan, and most insurers take that into account during <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at different roofing materials, how weather affects their durability, and what you can expect to pay for them per square (i.e.,100 square feet).</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesa3tabrooflast\">How long does a 3-tab roof last?</h3>\n<p>Because they’re inexpensive and easy to install, 3-tab shingles are some of the most common roofing materials and are found on all <a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">types of roofs</a>. Depending on where you are, you may find warranties of up to 25 years for a 3-tab roof. However, the average 3-tab roof lasts about 12 to 15 years in a mild climate. In severe weather areas such as California and Florida, that drops to seven to 10 years. This is the result of harsh winds and a beating sun taking its toll on the shingles.</p>\n<p>Each 3-tab shingle is made of asphalt that forms a watertight seal over the house and has mineral granules laid on top for color and durability. The cost ranges from $70 to $150 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesanarchitecturalshinglerooflast\">How long does an architectural shingle roof last?</h3>\n<p>Like 3-tab shingles, architectural shingles are made from asphalt; however, they are more durable than their 3-tab counterparts. Their average life span is between 25 and 30 years, but again, severe weather conditions may reduce that to 10 to 12 years.</p>\n<p>Architectural shingles have a similar composition to 3-tabs, but they’re heavier, which is why they’re more durable. Additionally, architectural shingles aren’t flat so they can mimic more expensive <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">roofing materials</a>. Ultimately, they’re considered a more high-end roofing material. and cost you anywhere from $250 to $400 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesametalrooflast\">How long does a metal roof last?</h3>\n<p>Metal roofs are usually made from aluminum or steel and are particularly popular in hurricane-prone areas. They have a life span of 20 to 50 years with warranties in the 20 year range, although durability does vary based on the material. Lesser quality metal roofs made from thinner metals (26 to 29 gauge) usually have a shorter life span of up to 20 years.</p>\n<p>The type and the thickness of the metal also impacts price. A roof made of aluminum or steel might cost $115 per square, but one made of copper or stone-coated steel may cost up to $900 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesaclaytilerooflast\">How long does a clay tile roof last?</h3>\n<p>Clay roof tiles, most commonly seen as terracotta tiles popular on Southwest homes, do well in hot, sunny conditions and resist rot. While they can start showing their age in 15 to 20 years in Florida, most come with a warranty of at least 30 years. They can last 50 years or longer in ideal conditions.</p>\n<p>The per square cost of clay tiles is around $600 to $800. But once installed, there is little maintenance required for a long-lasting roof. Please note, however, that clay tiles are heavy, so they aren’t the right choice for every home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesawoodrooflast\">How long does a wood roof last?</h3>\n<p>Wood roofs come in two types: rustic shakes and machine-cut shingles. Neither are as practical as more modern materials like asphalt – particularly in hot, humid climates – but many people find them aesthetically pleasing. In fact, other materials are often made to look like wood.</p>\n<p>Wood roofs last about 30 years when perfectly maintained. The more realistic estimate is around 10 years, and that may be even shorter in coastal regions. They can cost anywhere from $250 to $600 per square for shingles and as much as $900 for wood shakes. Both fare well against hurricane winds, but they require a lot of maintenance. You need to inspect a wood roof annually for rot and warped or split shingles that could affect water resistance. Damaged shingles need to be replaced immediately to maintain the integrity of the roof.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesaslaterooflast\">How long does a slate roof last?</h3>\n<p>A slate roof is about the highest-end roof you can get with the longest life span. A properly installed slate roof can last up to 100 years and can withstand most weather conditions including sun, heat, and wind. They are perfect for locations such as Florida, Louisiana, and California where the elements can wreak havoc on a roof.</p>\n<p>However, you pay a hefty price for such durability. The average cost of a slate roof is between $600 and $1,500 per square. And remember, durability isn’t forever. Wear and tear continually weakens your roof, so you may have to replace it in just 25 years. That’s even more true for soft slate tiles.</p>\n<p>Plus, slate tiles are heavy, so your costs could go even higher if you have to reinforce your home’s framework to support the weight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesbuiltuproofinglast\">How long does built-up roofing last?</h3>\n<p>Built-up roofing is most often used on low-pitch and flat roofs. They consist of a series of asphalt and ply sheet layers on top of a cover board and insulation and a final reflective cap sheet made of minerals or a covering of asphalt and gravel. Not only does this make for excellent waterproofing, but flat roofs usually stand up to hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>Built-up roofs can last as long as 40 years and often come with warranties between 15 and 30 years. This life span is a little shorter than some other types of roofing materials, but built-up roofings is often one of the only options for flat roofs. Luckily, built-ups are easy to maintain and inexpensive, costing anywhere from $250 to $400 per square.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongdoroofslastinfloridaandlouisiana\">How long do roofs last in Florida and Louisiana?</h2>\n<p>How long your roof lasts in the hurricane-prone states of Florida and Louisiana depends on the type of roof that you have. Roofs take a heavier beating and don’t last as long in these states. For example, a 3-tab roof’s lifespan drops to around seven to 10 years while architectural shingles may only last 10 to 12 years. Higher quality roofs such as clay tiles can do well against hurricane conditions, keeping a life expectancy of up to 20 years.</p>\n<p>No matter what type of roofing material you have, you need to look into wind mitigation. Taking a few simple steps to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">hurricane-proof your home</a> goes a long way to keeping you and your family safe.</p>"

    body: "<p>For all the warnings we hear about the threat of rising sea levels and intensifying hurricanes, few seem to be using that information when it comes to finding a place to live. Nothing makes this clearer than when you look at how many people are moving to Florida. Last year, the state saw nearly 600 new residents per day.</p>\n<p>That’s right, <em>per day</em>!</p>\n<p>You can hardly blame anyone for wanting to live in Florida﹘the state does have phenomenal weather and no personal income tax. But the flip side of all those sunny days is the increased risk brought on by climate change. In this post, we take a look at how many people picked the Sunshine State and what they need to know about climate risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridaspopularitybythenumbers\">Florida’s popularity by the numbers</h2>\n<p>Florida has always been a popular location for people looking to put down roots. In fact, it’s among <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2021/census-2020-data-results.html\">13 states with the fastest population growth</a>, increasing by more than 14 percent in the last 10 year. Florida also joined Texas and Arizona at the top of the list for states with the largest net domestic migration gains, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2021-population-estimates.html\">most recent census data</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida: 220,890</li>\n<li>Texas: 170,307</li>\n<li>Arizona: 93,026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This number is the difference between people moving in and people moving out. As you can see, Florida is by far the biggest winner by that measurement. Compare that to the states with the largest net domestic migration losses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California: -367,299</li>\n<li>New York: -352,185</li>\n<li>Illinois: -122,460</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can’t look at those numbers and draw conclusions about why people choose to settle down in Florida, but people often try. Some say that Californians and New Yorkers are trying to get away from high taxes or that Illinoisans are escaping brutal winter weather. All of these are just guesses.</p>\n<p>However, we do know one thing. At least one major report shows the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">clock is ticking on climate change</a>, and that means people buying homes in Florida may be taking on more risk than they anticipated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasingclimaterisksdontdeterhomebuyers\">Increasing climate risks don’t deter homebuyers</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">Climate change affects your home</a> in several ways, but one of the biggest is your exposure to risk. For some Floridians, rising oceans mean their homes now sit just below sea level. Others are more likely to suffer wind damage and flooding from the increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>But as census data shows, these realities aren’t causing people to think twice about living in Florida. Moreover, only <a href=\"/blog/where-to-buy-property-climate-change/\">48 percent of homebuyers don’t consider climate change</a> when deciding on a home.</p>\n<p>Long story short, human behavior is hard to change, and people are ultimately going to live in places that bring them joy. The real question is: how can we make them safer wherever they land?</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhomefromclimaterisks\">How to protect your home from climate risks</h2>\n<p>When it comes to protecting your home from climate change, knowledge is power. You want to know what your risks are so you can reduce their impact. We’ve found a couple of tools that help with this.</p>\n<p>The first is the <a href=\"https://hazards.fema.gov/nri\">National Risk Index</a> from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It scores communities on their risk for 18 natural disasters, including coastal flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes, and includes data for community resiliency and expected annual losses. Another useful tool comes from <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com\">Flood Factor</a>, a free online application that incorporates data about our changing environment to determine a property’s flood risk.</p>\n<p>Once you know what perils you’re exposed to, you can reinforce your property against them. For a Florida homeowner on the coast, that may mean adding <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a> to your roof or taking other steps to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">hurricane-proof your home</a>. Homeowners more inland, however, may want to learn about <a href=\"/blog/wildfires-in-florida/\">protecting properties from wildfires</a>.</p>\n<p>Another key step in protecting your home? Knowing what your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> covers. For example, home insurance typically covers wind damage, but water damage from floods is almost always excluded. If flooding is common in your area, then you may want to look at adding <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy.</p>\n<p>Not sure if all your risks are covered?

Appraisals can cost anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-much-does-an-appraisal-cost/\">$300 to $450</a> – sometimes more in high-demand markets.</p>\n<p>There are generally 15 factors that influence a <a href=\"/blog/when-to-get-your-home-reappraised/\">home appraisal</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Location</li>\n<li>Construction materials</li>\n<li>Home age</li>\n<li>Design of home</li>\n<li>Curb appeal</li>\n<li>Number of bedrooms</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms</li>\n<li>Square footage</li>\n<li>Type of heat and air conditioning</li>\n<li>Storage space</li>\n<li>Garage space</li>\n<li>Home renovations</li>\n<li>Current real estate market</li>\n<li>Nearby attractions or amenities</li>\n<li>How much comparable homes sold for</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, there is a lot more to the fair market value of a home than just how much it would cost to build the home. Even brand-new homes are sold at a markup from the building costs because contractors need to make money on the deal. And how desirable the area is will play a big factor in whether or not the fair market value is higher or lower than the building costs.</p>\n<p>Castle also notes, “After widespread financial hardship, the market value of a home can drop below its replacement costs.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"howyourhomesreplacementcostisdetermined\">How your home’s replacement cost is determined</h2>\n<p>You’ll often see your home's “replacement cost” in insurance policies. This is what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up after a total loss.</p>\n<p>Replacement cost is usually calculated as your home’s square footage multiplied by the cost of building materials per square foot. Home Advisor notes the average cost to rebuild a house is about <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/\">$150 per square foot</a> but can be more for high-end or custom homes.</p>\n<p>What exactly goes into the cost per square foot? The formula considers several factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exterior building materials</li>\n<li>Number of rooms</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms</li>\n<li>Quality of interior materials and finish</li>\n<li>Special features (fireplaces, crown molding, etc.)</li>\n<li>Roof type</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Folks often get concerned when they see a much lower replacement cost compared to what they bought their home for (market value). According to Grant Muller, owner of Spaces Real Estate in Chicago, “If your insurance policy is lower than what you're paying for your home, don't be overly concerned with this number. In fact, most homeowners don't insure their properties at the market value. That kind of coverage would come with a higher premium and a higher deductible.”</p>\n<p>Muller brings up a good point. If you insure your home for the market value, you could be paying more in insurance that won’t build you more of a home than what you have. You’ll be overinsured. The market value of your home will likely fluctuate much more than the replacement cost of your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofindyourhomesvalue\">How to find your home’s value</h2>\n<p>Again, the best way to figure out your home value is to get a professional appraisal. But if you’re thinking about refinancing, remodeling, or selling; or you’re just curious about how your home is faring in the marketplace, you don’t need to pay for an appraisal to get an estimate.</p>\n<p>Online home valuation tools can give you a ballpark estimate of your home’s value. In fact, if you sign up for updates, you’ll get notified when your home’s estimated value changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/\">Redfin</a>, for example, easy to use. Simply type in your home address (or any address you’re interested in) to see an estimate. If the home is for sale, you can see the market price. If it isn’t for sale, you will see the last sold price based on the public record.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatmakeshomevalueschange\">What makes home values change?</h2>\n<p>As you can imagine, home values fluctuate depending on market conditions. Ideally, your home appreciates in value because you live in a sought after neighborhood. Desirable neighborhoods often have good schools, nice parks, and other amenities that make living in the area more enjoyable or comfortable.</p>\n<p>Factors that can affect home worth include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Economic conditions</li>\n<li>Inventory</li>\n<li>Interest rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a community is economically comfortable, the value of homes tends to go up. Folks with more disposable income can often upgrade their homes, which boosts the local housing market.</p>\n<p>In general, there’s a close relationship between the economy and housing values. If the economy slows down, the money supply restricts, making it harder to borrow. Fewer homes will likely go on the market as folks stay put in their existing homes. That can cause prices to drop.</p>\n<p>However, during good economic conditions when there’s not many homes for sale, the market value in that area can rise.</p>\n<p>Chief Real Estate Analyst Emile L'Eplattenier at <a href=\"https://theclose.com/\">TheClose.com</a> explains, “In <a href=\"/blog/high-value-home-insurance/\">expensive areas</a> with low inventory, replacement costs can be far lower than what you paid for the home as half or more of the value is in the land itself. In fact, in places like Beverly Hills, multi-million dollar homes are often torn down and replaced with brand new homes even after spending tens of millions of dollars for the property.”</p>\n<p>Interest rates can also impact a home’s value. When interest rates go up, buying a <a href=\"/blog/saving-tips-first-time-homeowners/\">new home</a> becomes more cost prohibitive. If fewer people are in the market to buy, prices may dip. Conversely, lower interest rates may increase home valuations if more buyers enter the market and folks want to cash out their home’s equity.</p>\n<p>You can personally affect the value of your home, too. Home maintenance, like painting or <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">installing a new roof</a>, can increase the value of your home. <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">Renovating your home</a> or adding square footage can also increase its value. If you don’t maintain your home, its value will likely drop, particularly when compared to other homes in the area.</p>"

    body: "<p>Discussing how much personal property coverage you need can be, well, personal. It's important to take an honest inventory of the items you own and how much it would cost to replace them. It also helps to know how this inventory impacts your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchpersonalpropertyinsurancedoineed\">How Much Personal Property Insurance Do I Need?</h2>\n<p>Some homeowners opt to only account for their \"high impact\" items: think TVs, furniture, computers, and so on. Others want to account for clothes, decorations, and the other things that would be lost in a total disaster. Often, the premium increase is negligible, so it's worth the peace of mind to cover all of your belongings. For most Kin policies, an extra $25,000 in coverage adds only $30 to your annual premium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal property coverage</a> is often calculated as a percentage of your home's replacement cost, which is defined by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>The minimum coverage allowed by most companies, including Kin, is 10 percent of your home's replacement value. If your home would cost $200,000 to rebuild, this gives you a minimum of $20,000 in personal property coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replacementcostreplacementcostreplacementcost\">Replacement Cost, Replacement Cost, Replacement Cost!</h2>\n<p>In evaluating a policy, it's important to read the fine print. As it pertains to personal property coverage, make sure that the policy covers your goods at <strong>replacement cost</strong>. This means that your TV will be covered at the amount to get a new, similar TV. The alternative, actual cash value, covers the TV for the amount it'd go for on eBay. This can be a big difference and is a very unwelcome surprise when it comes time to file a claim. All of Kin's policies cover you at replacement cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canioptoutofpersonalpropertycoverage\">Can I Opt Out of Personal Property Coverage?</h2>\n<p>With an exclusion form, most homeowners insurance companies will allow you to opt out. This protects the carrier from homeowners that might take legal action if, in the event of a total loss, they find that their personal property is not covered. If you want to lower your home insurance premium, there are certainly more advisable ways to do it.</p>"

    body: "<p>We’ve teamed up with One Tree Planted to plant 100 trees in your state for everyone you refer who gets a Kin policy. So… why trees? Glad you asked.</p>\n<p>We serve communities that are the most impacted by <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change</a>. Homeowners in Florida and California are at greater risk of hurricanes, floods, and wildfires – big catastrophes made worse and more frequent by our warming world.</p>\n<p>So we decided to do our part to help combat climate change. Here’s why trees are so vital to that mission.</p>\n<h2 id=\"treesandclimatechange\">Trees and Climate Change</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2927/examining-the-viability-of-planting-trees-to-help-mitigate-climate-change/\">According to NASA</a>, an international research team set out to estimate the effect of restoring forested land as a way to mitigate climate change.</p>\n<p>First, the team started with a model that estimates the planet’s reforestation potential, which revealed we could feasibly support 25 percent more forests than we currently have. To put a figure on it, that’s another 2.2 billion acres of forests.</p>\n<p>If all those trees were planted, the team estimated it could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capture 205 gigatons of carbon.</li>\n<li>Reduce carbon in the atmosphere by about 25 percent.</li>\n<li>Negate about 20 years of human-produced carbon emissions at today’s rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why does extra carbon dioxide hurt our atmosphere? It’s a greenhouse gas that absorbs and radiates heat. The more carbon in our atmosphere, the warmer our planet gets. Warmer climate melts polar ice caps, makes sea levels rise, creates intense storms, increases the acidity of the ocean, and causes severe droughts.</p>\n<p>Carbon in our atmosphere has already <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures\">warmed the world by 1° C</a> since pre-industrial times. It even hit a new record high in 2019: <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide\">409.8 parts per million</a>. The ocean’s acidity also increased by 30 percent.</p>\n<p>Granted, planting billions of trees is going to take time and a lot of global cooperation. But if we don’t cut and reduce emissions in the atmosphere, we’re on track to hit a whopping <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/\">3.9° C</a> increase by 2100.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtreescanmitigateclimatechange\">How Trees Can Mitigate Climate Change</h2>\n<p>Trees can be an essential tool in the effort to reduce carbon emissions. Here’s a quick rundown of all the ways trees benefit us:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Trees absorb greenhouse gases like carbon from the atmosphere.</strong> One mature tree can absorb 48 pounds of carbon every year.</li>\n<li><strong>Trees can reduce the</strong> <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\"><strong>impact of severe flooding</strong></a> <strong>and storms.</strong> They absorb the extra water in the soil as it surges on land and release it into the air as vapor.</li>\n<li><strong>Trees keep us comfortable.</strong> Because of their shade, trees keep our communities cooler, which helps us <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">save on energy costs</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Trees support agriculture.</strong> Their shade helps the soil retain moisture so it doesn’t dry out.</li>\n<li><strong>Trees support biodiversity.</strong> They’re an essential part of a thriving ecosystem and create habitats for many species, including endangered ones.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"thestateswithalotatstake\">The States with A Lot at Stake</h2>\n<p>Florida is home to <a href=\"https://www.fdacs.gov/Forest-Wildfire/Our-Forests/State-Forests\">38 state forests</a>, covering over 1,153,693 acres. But every year, the Atlantic hurricane season threatens Florida’s forest resources that provide fresh air, wildlife habitat, and clean water. In fact, unhealthy forests have been a major contributor in the wildfires Florida has seen recently.</p>\n<p>Similarly, California’s droughts and record-high temperatures have taken a toll on its forests. Since the drought started in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/catreemortality/toolkit/?cid=FSEPRD609121\">more than 147 million trees have died</a>. Since 2017 alone, 18 million trees have died. For perspective, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/13/18221822/california-149-million-dead-trees-wildfire\">a “normal” tree mortality rate</a> is much less than a million per year in California.</p>\n<p>These dead trees have been fueling the brutal <a href=\"/blog/wildfire-season-is-year-round/\">wildfire season</a> we’ve seen this year and years past.</p>\n<p>Planting young, healthy trees can help restore and stabilize forests and mitigate the effects of climate change both states are enduring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goingoutonalimbtomakeadifference\">Going Out on a Limb to Make a Difference</h2>\n<p>To support the communities we serve, we’ve reimagined our referral program. We’re proud to partner with <a href=\"https://onetreeplanted.org/\">One Tree Planted</a> to plant 100 trees in the forests of Florida or California for every friend or family member who gets a policy with Kin.</p>\n<p>One Tree Planted ensures the trees are native to the area and plants them at a time conducive to their survival. Every tree helps to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restore forests after natural disasters.</strong> New trees make forests more resilient and help reduce the impact of hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding.</li>\n<li><strong>Support local ecosystems.</strong> Young, healthy trees filter pollutants from wetlands and provide shelter for wildlife.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect endangered wildlife.</strong> Restoring natural habitats ensures the survival of endangered species.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce the impact of wildfires.</strong> Young, healthy forests help suppress future wildfires.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect the water supply.</strong> Two-thirds of California’s water supply comes from its forests.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce carbon emissions.</strong> One mature tree sequesters 48 pounds of carbon each year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/referral/\">Tell your friends</a>, and let’s work together to help our forests thrive.</p>"

    body: "<p>Dreaming about owning a home but feeling like it’s out of reach? It might be more doable than you think.</p>\n<p>Mortgage rates are no longer at the historic lows we saw in 2020, but even with the recent jump to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-03-21-22\">4.59 percent</a> for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, they’re still relatively low. That makes homeownership a real possibility, so now is the time to start thinking about how to afford a house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoaffordahouse\">How to afford a house</h2>\n<p>Despite affordable mortgage rates, many people still struggle to buy a home. Perhaps the biggest issue is surging cost. In January 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/existing-home-sales-show-strong-growth-of-6-5-in-january-2022\">median home price reached $358,000</a> – up more than 15 percent from the prior year.</p>\n<p>But this shouldn’t discourage you from house hunting. All you need is a little planning, so we asked real estate experts for their tips on how to afford a house. Here’s what they had to say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1lookatfirsttimehomebuyermortgageoptions\">1. Look at first-time home buyer mortgage options</h2>\n<p>First-time home buyers have mortgage options available that don’t require the 10 to 20 percent down payment of a conventional mortgage. For example, you might be eligible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan.</strong> FHA loans require 3.5 percent down with a minimum credit score of 580; those with credit scores between 500 and 579 can qualify with 10 percent down.</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan.</strong> Eligibility for a VA loan is based on military service, but it requires no money down. Note that the VA has no credit score requirement, but lenders who provide the loans may.</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan.</strong> USDA loans provide low interest, zero-down financing for home buyers in rural areas. The USDA asks for a 640 credit score, but that can vary by lenders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These programs ease the requirements to qualify for a loan and help make getting a down payment more affordable to more people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2loweryourdebt\">2. Lower your debt</h2>\n<p>Lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Your DTI is simply the amount of debt payments you make each month compared to your income. Lenders prefer a DTI ratio of less than 36 percent. Ideally, no more than 28 percent of that will go toward your mortgage. If your DTI is higher, lenders might be concerned about your ability to afford the mortgage.</p>\n<p>You can use a <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/goals-credit/debt-to-income-calculator\">DTI calculator</a> to help you figure out where you stand right now. Then you can lower your DTI by paying down your debt. This often means <a href=\"/blog/tricks-to-paying-off-credit-cards/\">tackling credit card debt</a> and student loans. In fact, student loans that are in deferment can hurt you by increasing your debt even though you’re not required to make monthly payments.</p>\n<p>According to David Dye of Gold View Realty, “A very loose rule of thumb in the industry is that for every $25 of monthly debt eliminated, the loan approval amount increases by $5,000.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"3buywhatyoucanafford\">3. Buy what you can afford</h2>\n<p>Don’t get stuck on trying to afford your dream home. Sometimes a “right now” home is the smart way to go. This might mean choosing a smaller home or choosing a different neighborhood than you originally planned.</p>\n<p>Many realtors call this buying a starter home. This is a way to lay down roots, make regular payments, and build equity in your home. Your equity can be your future down payment on a home that is more suited to your long-term needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4useyourretirementforadownpayment\">4. Use your retirement for a down payment</h2>\n<p>If you don’t already own a home, your biggest asset is probably your <a href=\"/blog/ira-tax-deduction/\">retirement plan</a>. The IRS allows home buyers to take out up to $10,000 from an IRA or 401(k) plan without the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty for those under the age of 59 ½. The funds must be used within 120 days of withdrawal to avoid the penalty, and all funds are added to your taxable income for the year.</p>\n<p>For a Roth IRA, you can take out all contributions tax-free plus another $10,000 in earnings because you’ve already paid taxes on contributions.</p>\n<p>You can also borrow money from your retirement plan, but it counts toward your DTI. You could also consider cashing more out, but that typically means paying taxes and a penalty (for those under 59 ½).</p>\n<h2 id=\"5knowwhentowalkaway\">5. Know when to walk away</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to get emotionally attached to a home that’s either priced too high or has too many issues and will be a money trap.</p>\n<p>David Reischer, real estate specialist at <a href=\"https://real-estate-law.legaladvice.com\">LegalAdvice.com</a>, advises, “A home buyer needs to know the time to walk away from a property when the seller has a property that is overpriced and refuses to negotiate. It is not enough to simply fall in love with a property and throw reason out the window.”</p>\n<p>One way to protect yourself is to <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">ask plenty of question before buying</a>. Asking questions helps you understand exactly what you’re getting yourself into.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6commissionrebates\">6. Commission rebates</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://propertyclub.nyc\">Property Club</a> CEO Andrew Weinberger, “Buyer rebates are legal in 40 states, and they’re a great way to save on a home.”</p>\n<p>He notes that you can get up to a 2 percent rebate, depending on the purchase price. That’s often enough to cover <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">closing costs</a>, which are typically 2 to 3 percent of the purchase price.</p>\n<p>You can negotiate rebates with your realtor at the onset of the buying process, so you know how to handle your closing costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7considerafixerupper\">7. Consider a fixer-upper</h2>\n<p>If you’re handy and capable of making upgrades on your own, consider getting a fixer upper that is priced below other homes in the area. You may even qualify for an <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/203k/203k--df\">FHA 203(k) loan</a>, a type of FHA loan that factors in the costs of rehabilitation into the loan so that you can afford the expenses of fixing up the house.</p>\n<p>The amount dedicated to improvements is capped at $35,000. This strategy allows you to negotiate a price on a place that is below market value while you develop a plan to improve it and build equity in it quickly with improvements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getclosetoyourdesiredlocation\">8. Get close to your desired location</h2>\n<p>Many people, especially those with young children, are very focused on buying a property in the right school district. This can lead to much higher home prices that might be out of your budget. Charter schools and magnet programs, however, allow you to live outside of the district.</p>\n<p>“Looking at charter schools helps you get top-notch schools while living in a more affordable community,” Josh Stech, CEO of <a href=\"https://sundae.com\">Sundae</a>, a real estate marketplace, says. “If you don’t need to send your kids to public schools, on the other hand, your cost per square foot will go way down outside of top-rated school districts. Focus there.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9askforanearlyinheritance\">9. Ask for an early inheritance</h2>\n<p>If you have family members willing to help you out, Cynthia Sparagna, a California <a href=\"https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/sales/sherman-oaks-ca-usa\">Sotheby’s</a> realtor, says, “Ask for an inheritance early.”</p>\n<p>Sparagna notes that the bank will likely require you to season the money by leaving it in an account for 90 days. Plus, you may need a “gift letter” stating that the money is not a loan.</p>\n<p>This money can be used for the down payment or to pay down other debts to help you afford the home. If you know the money is coming your way eventually, see if your relatives are willing to use it to help with your down payment. Sparagna say parents and family members \"realize they are helping their child invest and sometimes include themselves in the investment creating a win/win strategy to prevail in securing the property.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"10explorepartialownershipoptions\">10. Explore partial ownership options</h2>\n<p>There are investors who don’t want to live in your house but will pay part of the purchase price for a percentage ownership of the home. While you’re responsible for the monthly payments and maintenance of the property, the investor waits for the sale date to take their cut.</p>\n<p>Be warned: in practice, this is a complex financial transaction. Don’t move forward unless you have a contract drawn up by an attorney to protect your interests. Local real estate investment clubs may have a pool of investors interested in this type of transaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11reviseyourmonthlybudget\">11. Revise your monthly budget</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners think about a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-budget-after-buying-a-house/\">budget after they buy their home</a>. However, with a smart budget in place before house hunting, you might be able to afford that home sooner than later.</p>\n<p>Think about where you spend your money and look for areas where you can save. This might mean dropping your daily Starbucks and drinking homemade coffee or grabbing the free cup at work. You can drop multiple television subscriptions and pay for the one you watch most often. Look for ways to make groceries cheaper by cutting coupons and making a meal plan based on sale items.</p>\n<p>By revising your budget, you free up more cash that you can use for the down payment or monthly mortgage payments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12thinkmultifamilyproperty\">12. Think multifamily property</h2>\n<p>According to Dan Beaulieu of <a href=\"https://www.burlingtonhousebuyers.com\">Burlington House Buyers</a>, this strategy involves “buying a small multifamily property, two to four units, and living in one unit and renting out the others.”</p>\n<p>Real estate experts call this strategy “house hacking.” It virtually eliminates your monthly mortgage through the rents you collect. You can learn more about it in “<a href=\"/blog/saving-tips-first-time-homeowners/\">8 Money-Saving Tips for First-Time Homeowners</a>.”</p>\n<p>“As an added bonus,” Beaulieu notes, “Those two to four unit properties also qualify for FHA loans, which require a down payment of only 3.5 percent.”</p>\n<p>A word of caution: you’ll need to use some of your income to cover maintenance expenses on those rental units. Plus, you’ll need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> on the property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13setatimeline\">13. Set a timeline</h2>\n<p>After reviewing your finances and talking to a mortgage officer about what you need to do to qualify for a home, set a goal and a timeline to stay on track. This timeline should have specific milestones for when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debts will be paid off.</li>\n<li>Savings will reach a certain amount.</li>\n<li>A monetary gift will be seasoned.</li>\n<li>You get prequalified for a loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea here is to see accomplishments as they happen so you build confidence and momentum that you can afford homeownership.</p>"

    body: "<p>Most folks want to become a landlord because they’ve heard it’s a good financial opportunity. Investment properties are typically easy to finance, and with the right planning, they can be pretty profitable.</p>\n<p>But being a landlord is also a lot of responsibility and not necessarily for the faint of heart.</p>\n<p>So your first step is to figure out what the role entails and whether it’s the right fit for you. That’s where we can help. We talked to real estate experts for their pointers on how to become a successful landlord. Here’s what they said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1findtherightlocation\">1. Find the Right Location</h2>\n<p>Location is everything in real estate, and that’s true for rental properties, too. Bill Samuel, a <a href=\"http://www.blueladderdevelopment.com\">real estate developer</a>, explains that being a landlord is a business and you need to approach it that way.</p>\n<p>“Getting great tenants starts with having a good property in a good location,” Samuel says. “Good tenants want to live in clean properties in safe areas.”</p>\n<p>Research the communities where you plan on owning a property. Get an idea of why tenants want to move to the area. Is it close to a business district or universities?</p>\n<p>Next, take a look at the range of rentals in the area. A bigger, updated home will generate more rent than a smaller one that needs work. Estimate what your revenue will be based on the type of investment you make.</p>\n<p>Start taking note of how much property in the area costs so you can build your budget or plan for a loan. Based on rental rates, you might decide that a smaller home will give you a better return on your investment even if you can afford a bigger property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2understandlandlordtenantlaws\">2. Understand Landlord-Tenant Laws</h2>\n<p>Research the landlord-tenant laws in your state and county. You’ll want to know what tenants’ rights are, what your obligations are as a landlord, and the process for eviction if necessary.</p>\n<p>This part of your assessment can’t be understated. Being a landlord is a big responsibility, and your tenants are entitled to a safe and well-maintained home. You’ll need to make sure the property meets state and county guidelines regarding habitability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3setabudget\">3. Set a Budget</h2>\n<p>You already did research on the area and know property values and probable rents. Now it’s time to crunch the numbers and set a budget for yourself. Setting a budget requires more than just looking at a prospective mortgage.</p>\n<p>“Most issues can be resolved with enough liquidity. Keep your house in order and ensure you have enough reserves to cover unexpected issues,” Edward Briggs of HomeReviews explains. “This also puts you in a prime position if new investment opportunities arise.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to the purchase, think about the mortgage, closing costs, and any upfront capital needed for repairs to get the house up to rental standards. Don’t forget to consider other expenses associated with being a landlord, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage cost.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li>Property insurance.</li>\n<li>City licensing, mandatory inspections, and annual registration fees.</li>\n<li>Utilities.</li>\n<li>Rental income taxes.</li>\n<li>Maintenance costs.</li>\n<li>Marketing and advertising fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the work you choose to outsource, you may also have to factor in the cost of a bookkeeper, property manager, and attorney to help draw up your lease or offer guidance on disputes.</p>\n<p>Make sure the income you can charge for a property is enough to cover all expenses, including taxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4buyaproperty\">4. Buy a Property</h2>\n<p>Once you have an idea of costs and potential income, it’s time to find your investment property. Your budget should dictate how big or expensive the property is. This is a business decision, so don’t get bogged down in negotiations that make the property more expensive. Keep the budget in mind at all times when making an offer on a property and securing it.</p>\n<p>When you go through the escrow process, take advantage of all the inspections you can. You’ll want to have a good idea of the property’s condition, including the lifespan of its appliances and systems. You don’t want to buy a money trap that suddenly needs a new refrigerator or brand-new plumbing if you didn’t initially budget for it.</p>\n<p>Go back to your budget and update the numbers based on the actual value and expected costs of the property you’re buying. You’ll be able to get exact data on property taxes, insurance, and any licensing fees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5getlandlordinsurance\">5. Get Landlord Insurance</h2>\n<p>Your mortgage lender usually won’t let you close the loan without the right property insurance in place. Even if your rental property is a single-family detached home, you still need landlord insurance for it, not <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. That’s because you’re protecting the structure and your tenants need to protect their own belongings inside.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">Landlord insurance</a> is a type of dwelling fire policy, also called a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>. And luckily for you, you can get affordable landlord insurance with us. Get a quote in minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6preparetheproperty\">6. Prepare the Property</h2>\n<p>Remember, your property must meet an implied warranty of habitability in almost every state. In Florida, that means basic structural elements must be intact, including floors, stairs, walls, roofs, etc. Common areas must be maintained and free of hazards. Electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems must be operating safely. And it’s your responsibility to handle pests.</p>\n<p>After you close on the property, make sure it’s ready to live in. Take care of any repairs and give the property a deep clean so it’s ready for staging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7settherentalprice\">7. Set the Rental Price</h2>\n<p>Revisit your research to determine the rental price you’ll charge. Remember that the rental price needs to be more than the mortgage amount to cover additional expenses, like taxes and insurance. That said, you do want to keep the price competitive so the property rents quickly and attracts good tenants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8markettheproperty\">8. Market the Property</h2>\n<p>Take high-resolution, well-lit pictures of the property to use in your marketing materials. Write an enticing description of the property that highlights its best features, whether that’s the pool in the backyard, the large windows that let natural light in, or its recent renovations.</p>\n<p>Upload your photos and description on rental property websites like Zillow, Rentals, or Trulia.</p>\n<p>Another great way to market the property is to ask for referrals, especially if you're expanding from one property to multiple properties.</p>\n<p>“Leads are a dime a dozen, but for us, nothing beats referrals from our best tenants. Tenants who sign a lease through a referral stay longer and are generally great fits for the community because they already know someone in the building who had a positive enough experience to refer them,” Mike Catania, CEO of the referral program <a href=\"https://locar.is\">Locaris</a> explains. “Further, as vacancy rates are starting to climb from the economy's downturn, a referral from a great tenant makes an applicant with a lower credit score more attractive because someone we know is vouching for them.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9screenprospectivetenants\">9. Screen Prospective Tenants</h2>\n<p>Create a process to screen potential tenants. Ideally, you budgeted to pay for credit checks and background services on potential candidates. But you may want to prescreen tenants so you don’t pay for each candidate.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, you could incorporate the credit check or background screening cost into an application fee so you don’t need to worry about it.</p>\n<p>Either way, make sure you get the right information before you sign a lease. Look for candidates with a solid work history, no criminal background, and good credit scores. Your application may also screen for things like pet breeds or a number of children that will be in the household.</p>\n<p>This is where knowing the laws is important. You may have a two-bedroom home and have an applicant with four children. That might not meet the city’s occupancy standards and you’ll need to decline the applicant.</p>\n<p>When screening tenants, use objective standards and comply with anti-discrimination laws like the <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_rights_and_obligations\">Fair Housing Act</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10signalease\">10. Sign a Lease</h2>\n<p>Never rent out your property without a fully executed lease. Get the lease signed and collect the deposit before you turn over the keys. Verbal agreements and handshakes won’t protect you if there’s a dispute.</p>\n<p>Your lease should clearly spell out the terms and conditions of the property, including rent due dates, late fees and penalties, exit terms, and grounds for eviction. Include a property inventory form that states what you provide (e.g., washer and dryer) and the condition of those things as well as the condition of the house. You’ll refer to this property inventory and walk-through form when the tenant leaves to determine how much, if any, of the security deposit is owed.</p>\n<p>The goal is to develop a good relationship of reasonable expectations from the start. The relationship will hopefully strengthen over time.</p>\n<p>“Good relationships can mean that repairs are done quickly and efficiently, payments come and go at a more efficient rate, and overall the experience is just better,” as Lucas Robinson, CMO of <a href=\"https://www.crediful.com/\">Crediful</a>, points out. “Welcome them with lots of respect and be nice to them. They are staying there for some time, so they should feel like this is their home, not somewhere they feel sad or unsafe.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"11maintaintheproperty\">11. Maintain the Property</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! You’re officially a landlord. Now the work of maintaining the property begins.</p>\n<p>You’ll want to have a good handyman in your contacts for all the little repairs that pop up, like fixing leaky faucets or installing weatherstripping. Keeping up with maintenance helps keep tenants happy, as Ethan Taub, CEO of Loanry, explains.</p>\n<p>“Those small fixes you leave for now could turn into something big if you ignore it for too long,” says Taub. “So when your tenants show you something, take it seriously and sort it out. That house will outlive their time in it, so you have to take good care of it for everyone who will stay there.”</p>\n<p>Not only is property maintenance important to keeping good tenants, but it also helps keep your property value up. Appreciation in the property can become a valuable asset, so do what you can to improve it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12considerhiringapropertymanager\">12. Consider Hiring a Property Manager</h2>\n<p>Being a landlord can be a lot. Tenants call at all hours when they need something. Rent is invariably hard to collect at times. Maintenance and repairs can take a lot of your time as you coordinate contractors and oversee repairs. If your budget allows for it, hiring a property manager could be a big help.</p>\n<p>Property managers take care of everything from tenant screening to collecting rent and dealing with those 2 a.m. emergency calls. If you want to be a hands-off landlord, a property manager could be right for you. While some property managers charge a flat rate, you can expect to pay between 8 and 12 percent of your net collected rent for a property manager.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more tips on [how to successfully rent and manage your property]().</p>"

    body: "<p>It takes a lot of work to make a house a home. You may want to upgrade your kitchen, build a patio, or install hardwood floors. How to budget after buying a house to make that work – and to keep up with your bills and maintenance – can be a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makingahomeownersbudget\">Making a homeowners budget</h2>\n<p>It's easy to overspend without a homeowners budget. After <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">buying a house</a>, most folks need to fix up the house, account for family necessities, stay current on bills, and maybe even save a little for a rainy day. But even with a budget, it can be a challenge to stick to. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/10/11/the-average-american-overspends-by-nearly-7500-per.aspx\">79 percent of Americans</a> say they struggle to stick to their household budgets. Perhaps that's why <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/pf/expenses/index.html\">96 percent of people are stressed about money</a>.</p>\n<p>So let's fix that. Here, you'll get tips for creating a reasonable budget and some pointers on how to stick to it. Let's dive in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1analyzeyourspending\">1. Analyze your spending</h3>\n<p>Grab those paystubs, credit card statements, and bank statements, and get ready to take some notes. It's time to really sit down at look at where your money goes each month.</p>\n<p>Don't be surprised if you find a lot of non-essential spending in the mix. One <a href=\"https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/millennials-feel-the-most-pressure-to-spend-on-nonessentials-and-they-do\">survey found</a> adults spend an average of $697 every month on non-essentials; Millennials spend a monthly average of $838 on items some might consider extracurricular.</p>\n<p>That's not meant to spend shame! Non-essentials can be a much needed joy, and your budget should account for that. But the key is to know how much to allot this kind of spending so it doesn't get the better of you.</p>\n<p>A USA Today <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/07/americans-spend-thousands-on-nonessentials/39450207/\">report</a> breaks down some of our most common monthly spending habits when it comes to non-essential items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restaurant meals: $209.38</li>\n<li>Drinks: $188.68</li>\n<li>Takeout: $177. 88</li>\n<li>Buying lunch: $173.62</li>\n<li>Rideshares: $96.11</li>\n<li>Cable: $90.57</li>\n<li>Movie streaming: $23.09</li>\n<li>Music streaming: $22.41</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see there is some redundancy in those expenses, and that might help you decide which of these non-essentials are worth budgeting for and which can be trimmed in the service of helping you live more comfortably.</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you can opt for less expensive cable because you rely on streaming services for movies. Or maybe if you plan your work-lunches or evening meals in advance, you might be able to save an extra $50 a month.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Creating a budget is more than just allocating money to major areas of your household. It involves looking at spending habits and deciding which ones you want to change in order to save or put funds to better use.</p>\n<p>Make notes on what you currently spend and circle items you want to consider adjusting or eliminating from your monthly costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2learnthebasicsofmakingabudget\">2. Learn the basics of making a budget</h3>\n<p>When you start your budget, you'll first need to categorize your expenses to see what you absolutely need to spend to keep your household functioning, get to and from work, and pay for food and clothing for the family. It helps to think of these in terms of fixed expenses, variable expenses, and discretionary expenses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix expenses</strong> are things that don’t change from month to month, like your mortgage, insurance, car payments, and certain utilities (e.g., a cell phone or cable bill).</li>\n<li><strong>Variable expenses</strong> include things that change monthly, such as your water and electric bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Discretionary expenses</strong> include things like impulsive purchases – those amazing new shoes – or eating out because you were too tired to make dinner. As we touched on earlier, these expenses can quickly add up and eat into your overall monthly budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose the method you want to keep track of your budget: paper, a spreadsheet, or a budgeting program. Then create three columns: fixed expenses, variable household expenses, discretionary expenses. Write down the type of expense in each column with the amount. For variable expenses, add up a few months of bills to get a sense of the monthly average. For example, take three months of eating out (i.e $180, $235, $195), add them up and divide it by three ($203).</p>\n<p>Below is an example of monthly expenses and how they might be categorized.</p>\n<p>| Sample Monthly Budget |\n| --- |\n| Fixed Expenses |\n| Mortgage: $1,200 |\n| Car payment: $203 |\n| Home insurance premium: $90 |\n| Car insurance premium: $90 |\n| Cell phone: $290 |\n| TOTAL: $1,873 |</p>\n<p>The more detailed you can be with your spending, the easier it will be for you to determine what you can adjust. Notice how coffee is not part of eating out; it’s a category all on its own so you can assess what's necessary and what isn’t. You set the priorities.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the ultimate goal isn’t to restrict yourself from discretionary spending; it's to understand where your money goes so you can make informed adjustments.</p>\n<p>Once you add all the columns up, compare the total to your total household income. This is often an eye-opener for many folks. It isn’t uncommon to see yourself barely operating in the black or to see just how far into the red you go every month, putting the difference on <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">credit cards </a>that grow out of control.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3setasidefundsforhomemaintenanceorrepairs\">3. Set aside funds for home maintenance or repairs</h3>\n<p>Part of your budget should also account for <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance </a>that don’t always come up every month or every year, but need to be addressed. This is especially important when budgeting for a new home. When something breaks, it often happens unexpectedly, and putting those repairs on credit cards could lead to cumbersome interest charges.</p>\n<p>If you can, set aside some funds each month to account for these maintenance or repair costs. To get an idea of what those expenses might look like, take a look at the chart below.</p>\n<p>| Typical Home Maintenance &amp; Repair Costs |\n| --- |\n| Repair Type |\n| HVAC |\n| Roof |\n| Water Heater |\n| Gutters |</p>\n<p><em>Source: Home Advisor</em></p>\n<p>Look at your bank statements or talk to someone you know who owns a house to brainstorm things that come up during the year that need maintenance. This can help you plan and save up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4planforthefuture\">4. Plan for the future</h3>\n<p>Beyond your monthly essentials, make sure you are putting money toward your future. Check your paycheck stubs to see how much you are contributing to retirement. You can put $19,500 in 2020 into an employer-sponsored 401(k) or retirement plan.</p>\n<p>If your employer matches some of those funds, that is more money toward your retirement. If you don’t have a 401(k), think about how much you can set aside for your future. You can contribute $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older) to an IRA. To max that out, you would need to contribute $500 to $584 each month.</p>\n<p>Beyond retirement, you may have debt that needs some attention. To pay down debt, try to make payments beyond the minimum, which usually just covers interest charges.</p>\n<p>And if you have children, it's probably smart to think about college sooner rather than later. Sallie Mae <a href=\"https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/tools/college-planning-calculator/\">reports</a> 85 percent of parents expect that their children will go to college, but only 40 percent of parents developing a plan to pay for it. Tuition costs vary widely depending on whether your child goes to an in-state public university, goes to an out-of-state university, or attends a private university. The average annual costs of a <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/student-loans/average-cost-of-college\">four-year university range from $25,290 to $50,900</a> between tuition and other expenses.</p>\n<p>If you plan on covering four years of college, take the university costs, multiple that by four years of school, and then divide that number by the number of years you have left to save before your child is college-age.</p>\n<p>For example, if you plan on an in-state university for your one-year-old:</p>\n<p><strong>[$25,290 x 4 years] / (18-1) = $5,950.59</strong></p>\n<p>That’s $5,950.59 a year that you have to save for 17 years to meet today’s college costs. That works out to $495.88 a month. Keep in mind that college costs typically go up and you can also explore investing that money to help it grow faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5sticktoyourbudget\">5. Stick to your budget</h3>\n<p>A perfect budget only works if you stick to it. This is why we made the earlier note about discretionary spending. A budget should still allow you to enjoy life and your new home; it shouldn’t be so restrictive that you feel you can’t do anything.</p>\n<p>Remember that you qualified for the house based on your income and existing debt numbers. You’re in a good position to create a realistic budget that allows you to keep the household afloat while you save for long-term needs and enjoy life. But you might not be able to indulge every whim.</p>\n<p>This is where setting priorities comes in. All the costs that add up after your monthly expenses (retirement savings, home repairs, college funds) should be weighed against your discretionary spending. It’s one thing if you can do both without any sacrifices, but that isn't the reality for most Americans.</p>\n<p>Discretionary spending should not exceed <a href=\"https://www.discover.com/online-banking/banking-topics/budgeting-with-the-50-20-30-rule/\">30 percent of your monthly budget</a>. Even that can often be whittled down to put money toward better uses. Imagine if you cut your monthly takeout spending in half and used that money to save for an annual vacation.</p>\n<p>If you’re spending $177 on takeout and you manage to cut it to $88.50, that’s $1,062 dollars a year you just saved for a vacation.</p>\n<p>Once you have your priorities, plan each week so you can see them through. For example, if you’re eating takeout because you get home late after a gym class, plan ahead and cook extra the night before so you have leftovers waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Knowing why you are doing certain things with your homeowners budget is often enough to help you stick to it. And don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad week; refocus and get back to the plan. Doing so will put you in a much better position to succeed.</p>"

Here are seven tips for buying a home in a seller’s market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoidofferswithconstraints\">Avoid offers with constraints</h2>\n<p>Sellers are more inclined to take offers that are ready to go with no constraints on them. For example, most people want to sell their current home before they complete escrow on the new property. The seller, however, may not want to wait, and in a seller’s market, they probably don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Essentially, any concession you ask of the seller, whether it’s help with closing costs or time to find alternative financing, can make your offer less appealing. And in a seller’s market, the seller has little to no incentive to deal with complications. To compete, you need to make a clean offer quickly and close without needing to wait on other parties or transactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeanofferaboveasking\">Make an offer above asking</h2>\n<p>If you like a home, then chances are other buyers are interested in it too - especially in a seller’s market - and that pushes prices up. This means homebuyers may need to “make an offer that is higher than expected,” according to Stan Mead of <a href=\"http://www.sellmyhomeinsaltlakecity.com/\">Summit Home Buyers</a>.</p>\n<p>Depending on your location, you may not need to go very high over the asking price. You may show that you're a serious contender by offering just $2,000 above. That amount won’t have a major impact on your <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>, but remember that you aren’t the only one competing for the property. Those that have the funds may offer $10,000 or more above asking price, and that may put the house too far out of your budget.</p>\n<p>You can combat that, however, by looking for homes on the low end of your budget. That way, you have room to bid up without dipping into your savings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dontaskforpersonalproperty\">Don’t ask for personal property</h2>\n<p>A seller’s market is no time for haggling. Trying to cut a deal for patio furniture, custom bookcases, and chandeliers gives the seller extra time to think, and that’s usually not a good thing when the seller has lots of potential buyers. Sellers want the sale to go quickly without hassle, and quibbling over personal property complicates the transaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makealargedeposit\">Make a large deposit</h2>\n<p>Your deposit, called an earnest money deposit (EMD), is the first sign to the seller of how serious of a buyer you are. While you may only be required to put down one to three percent of the purchase price, the more you put down, the more serious you look. Sellers see a large deposit and assume you have the resources to fund the purchase, and this usually causes them to take your offer more seriously – sometimes even if it’s lower than other offers with a smaller EMD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"waivetheappraisalcontingency\">Waive the appraisal contingency</h2>\n<p>Waiving the <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> is a powerful tool in seller’s markets, but you may only be able to use it if you have a mortgage funding the purchase. Prices in fast-moving seller’s markets are inflated because of the lack of inventory. This means that properties going for more than the asking price might be appraised for less, so your loan may fall short. By waiving the appraisal contingency, you tell the seller that you have full faith that you’re buying a property worth the purchase price regardless of what experts might say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"payincash\">Pay in cash</h2>\n<p>One of the most stressful parts of escrow is waiting for the loan’s final approval and funding. If your loan is denied, then you don’t get the house and the seller has wasted time on a transaction that didn’t go through.</p>\n<p>But according to Eric Nerhood of Premier Property Buyers, “By using an all-cash purchase, there is no waiting for the money.” Offering all cash puts you in the driver’s seat where you don’t have to rely on lenders to make final approvals. Seller’s love this and often take a lower purchase price when the transaction is all cash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"offer1monthoffreeoccupancy\">Offer 1 month of free occupancy</h2>\n<p>Chances are most sellers are also looking to buy a home, which means they’re struggling with the same market conditions you are. So while they’re getting plenty of offers for their home, they might not have a new home to move into. Offering a month of occupancy gives the seller breathing room to finish their purchase and vacate, plus your first mortgage payment isn’t due for a month after you close. Jason Gelios from Community Choice Realty calls this an “out of the box amenity” that gives you an edge when competing against similar offers.</p>\n<p>Figuring out how to buy a house in a seller's market can seem impossible, but you can make it happen. Use these and other <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">tips to get you through the home-buying process</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Many of us dream about homeownership, but buying a house can seem out of reach. After all, a down payment can be tens of thousands of dollars, and that’s a barrier for many first-time homebuyers.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be. Plenty of people become homeowners with zero-down mortgages. While this is an entryway for many, it comes with its own set of considerations. Let's look at how to buy a house with no money down and how to know if it’s a good option for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisazerodownmortgage\">What is a zero-down mortgage?</h2>\n<p>A zero-down mortgage is simply a home loan that doesn’t require a down payment. Most <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgages</a> require you to make a down payment at closing. When you get a no-down payment mortgage, you essentially finance the entire house and only pay traditional closing costs, such as attorney fees and taxes. This makes <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">owning a house more affordable</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nomoneydownmortgageprograms\">No-money-down mortgage programs</h2>\n<p>There are two programs for first-time homebuyers where you can actually buy a home without making a down payment. Both programs are backed by federal funds to reduce the risk to lenders and encourage new purchases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) home loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/\">VA loans</a> are reserved for active-duty service members, members of the National guard, and veterans or their spouses, and eligibility depends on the applicant’s time in the military. The VA does not set a minimum credit score, but the lenders who make the loans may.</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Agriculture (USDA) home loans:</strong> <a href=\"https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do\">USDA loans</a> are designed to encourage property ownership in designated rural and suburban areas. In addition to having a home in one of these locations, you also have to meet certain financial requirements including a credit score of at least 640 and a combined household income that is less than 115 percent of the median income of the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"alternativestonomoneydownprograms\">Alternatives to no-money-down programs</h3>\n<p>The programs for a no-money-down mortgage are pretty limited, but they aren’t your only option if you’re struggling to put the funds together for a down payment. If you have some cash available, you might try a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loan:</strong> Depending on your credit score, you may be able to get an <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">FHA loan</a> for as little as 3.5 percent down.</li>\n<li><strong>Conventional home loan:</strong> You may be able to get a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan that only requires a 3 percent down payment. However, these loans typically have higher credit score requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Piggyback loan:</strong> Also called an 80/10/10 loan, a piggyback loan lets you get two mortgages at the same time. The first is for 80 percent of the purchase price, and then you piggyback a second loan on top of that for another 10 percent, leaving only 10 percent required for a down payment. This loan usually requires a higher credit score.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage assumption:</strong> Eric Nerhood of Premier Property Buyers explains that this is when “the buyer takes over the payments on the mortgage that the seller already has on the property.” This can get the seller out of a bad situation, while the buyer usually pays them just a nominal fee.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"privatemortgageinsuranceandnointerestloans\">Private mortgage insurance and no-interest loans</h2>\n<p>There is a tradeoff when you buy a home using a low-interest loan: you’ll have to pay <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI). This insurance protects the lender in case you default on your loan and your property goes into foreclosure. It’s a mechanism that allows lenders to loan money for most, or sometimes all, of the property’s price.</p>\n<p>But PMI can be pricey. It typically costs  anywhere from 0.5 to 1 percent of your loan amount, and that’s tacked onto your mortgage payment. Moreover, you keep paying it until you reach a minimum of 20 percent equity in the home. Then you can request to have the PMI removed.</p>\n<p>To be fair, neither USDA nor VA loans require PMI. However, both can have other fees to consider. The VA charges home buyers a funding fee between 1.4 percent and 3.6 percent of the loan. As for the USDA, it charges both an upfront guarantee fee and an annual fee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isazerodownorlowinterestloanrightforyou\">Is a zero-down or low-interest loan right for you?</h2>\n<p>If you want to buy a home and don’t have money for a down payment, a no-down loan may be a good – depending on your situation. According to Jason Gelios, top-producing realtor with Community Choice Realty, home buyers need to consider their goals and what the market is doing before choosing a mortgage.</p>\n<p>“If someone purchases a home and some unforeseen circumstance happens where they have to sell, they may not be able to sell the property for more than what they purchased it for,” says Gelios. “This could spell trouble.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, your particular situation determines what sort of mortgage is right for you. That said, we can offer a few things to think about to help you decide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"canyouaffordtheinterest\">Can you afford the interest?</h3>\n<p>A no-money-down loan may save you money on the front end, but you have to consider what that means over time. Everyone who takes out a loan pays more than the amount they borrow because they have to pay interest. Putting some money down reduces your interest and may actually be less expensive in the long run.</p>\n<p>Just because the loan doesn’t require a down payment doesn’t mean that you can’t put some money down. But if you choose this route, you need to be thoughtful about how much to pay. A small percentage down may not have much impact on a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatareyourlongtermplans\">What are your long-term plans?</h3>\n<p>For the most part, home values go up, and that generally means you’re more likely to see a good return on your investment the longer you stay in your home. But this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, as anyone who bought a home before the Great Recession can tell you.</p>\n<p>Plus, think about how stable your income is. If unforeseen circumstances cause you to have to get out of your loan, you may have to pay a hefty price.</p>\n<h3 id=\"areyoubuyingahomethatneedsrepairs\">Are you buying a home that needs repairs?</h3>\n<p>Normal maintenance alone can add up to a significant chunk of change every year, but if you’re looking at a home that needs major repairs, you may want to consider a no-down-payment loan. It can help you preserve your savings so you have a safety net of funds to handle home repairs.</p>\n<p>House flipper Alex Capozzolo says that if “you need to pay more than $10,000 on fixing up a house before you can move in, it makes sense to buy it with no money down.” He adds this may be especially true if the house is older and you anticipate more repairs in the future.</p>\n<p>The main idea here is to protect your nest egg, and it may apply in a number of scenarios. Just because you have a savings account doesn’t mean you should spend every dime of it on a down payment. You’ll likely need some of it for other expenses.</p>\n<p>Before you go for a loan that requires no money down, consider all aspects of your financial situation. A zero-down mortgage can certainly open up buying opportunities for those who qualify and don’t have the means to put a large down payment on the property. But while it makes the entry point easier, it also means higher mortgage payments, more interest paid over the course of the loan, and private mortgage insurance premiums.</p>"

    body: "<p>With its warm temperate climate, beautiful beaches, and lack of state income taxes, Florida is a great place to live. And a growing number of people moving to the Sunshine State are choosing to live in mobile home communities or buy manufactured homes for their land.</p>\n<p>Figuring out how to buy a mobile home in Florida can be just as complex as buying a site-built one – maybe even more so. Let’s explore some of the biggest issues that come with buying a manufactured home, including Florida mobile home financing and taxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5tipsforbuyingamobilehomeinflorida\">5 tips for buying a mobile home in Florida</h2>\n<p>In many ways, buying a manufactured home in Florida is a lot like the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a traditional home</a>. You want to determine if you’re ready, start saving for a down payment, and look into mobile home financing in Florida. Those steps, however, may look a little different when you’re purchasing a mobile home, so we put together five tips to help you dig into the specifics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1determinewhatyourebuying\">1. Determine what you’re buying</h3>\n<p>Yes, you’re buying a manufactured home, but you want to decide if you want to buy just the dwelling and rent a lot in a mobile home park or buy the land, too. Buying the land your home sits on may mean you see some return on your investment if the land appreciates. But lots in mobile home parks usually have utility hook-ups, so they can be more convenient.</p>\n<p>The additional services and the bonus of living in a secure location can make the fee for renting worth it. However, ownership can mean lower costs in the long run and the ability to recuperate a significant part of your investment by selling the land for a higher price than when you bought it.</p>\n<p>Making the choice between a mobile park community or buying your own land also gives you a better idea of your monthly costs. This is a key consideration when purchasing any home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2investigateseveralcommunities\">2. Investigate several communities</h3>\n<p>Some of the more common Florida mobile home communities are land-lease parks (i.e., you don’t own the land), land-owned subdivisions, and resident-owned communities. Within each of these, you may also find age-restricted or retirement communities. That’s a lot of options, so go to several and talk to the residents to get a sense of which fits you best.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that some municipalities in Florida restrict where you can place your mobile home. This usually means you end up in more rural areas outside of city limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3performyourduediligence\">3. Perform your due diligence</h3>\n<p>Before you buy a mobile home in Florida, check public records for any red flags. This might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going to the clerk of court and checking eviction records, title disputes, and other legal issues.</li>\n<li>Calling the local code enforcement office and asking about serious violations.</li>\n<li>Searching the internet to see if the mobile home park is up for sale or has recently changed hands.</li>\n<li>Checking the mobile home’s vehicle identification number through the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4readuponfloridasmobilehomelaws\">4. Read up on Florida’s mobile home laws</h3>\n<p>When you want to buy a mobile home in Florida, you may also want to familiarize yourself with the Florida statutes that <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0723/0723.html\">govern mobile home park tenancies</a>, particularly the section on obligations for residents and park owners. For example, mobile home park owners have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes.</li>\n<li>Provide access to all common areas at reasonable times.</li>\n<li>Keep the utilities the park is responsible for in good working condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mobile home owners have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep their mobile homes clean, neat, and sanitary.</li>\n<li>Comply with the mobile home park’s rules.</li>\n<li>Get written approval before making modifications to their mobile home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another important aspect of Florida laws governing manufactured homes is the information regarding <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0320/0320.html\">mobile home installation and permits</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5buymobilehomeinsurance\">5. Buy mobile home insurance</h3>\n<p>One of the attractions of mobile homes is their affordability. But even if they’re less than traditional homes, manufactured homes are major investments that need to be protected. That's where <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> comes in. Policies can help you overcome a financial setback if your mobile home is damaged by <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered perils</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, our mobile home insurance offers open-peril coverage for your dwelling, which means damage is usually covered unless it was caused by one of the events specifically excluded in the policy. The most common losses, like those caused by fire, windstorm, theft, and vandalism, are typically covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofinanceamobilehomeinflorida\">How to finance a mobile home in Florida</h2>\n<p>While mobile homes cost less than traditional homes, you’ll probably still need to get financing. A mobile home is only considered real property if the owner also owns the land it sits on and the home is permanently attached to that land, <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0300-0399/0320/Se_tions/0320.015.html\">according to Florida law</a>. If your manufactured home doesn’t fit this description, then it’s more likely considered chattel, or moveable personal property.</p>\n<p>You can finance a manufactured home that is chattel through a personal property loan, much like you finance a car. Typically, this requires about five percent down with your home as collateral that your lender can repossess if you fail to pay.</p>\n<p>Another option is the Federal Housing Authority’s Title I program. These are usually 20-year fixed-rate loans that you can use to purchase a manufactured home, a lot, or both. The down payment is usually between 3.5 and 10 percent.</p>\n<p>If your mobile home is considered real property, you may be able to get the following <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">types of mortgages</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conventional loan.</strong> These privately funded and insured mobile home loans in Florida offer competitive interest rates, but often require a good credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, and about 20 percent down.</li>\n<li><strong>A US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan.</strong> You can apply to the USDA Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, but you’ll have to meet certain income and geographic criteria to qualify.</li>\n<li><strong>A US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan.</strong> The VA also has a guaranteed loan program that can be used for manufactured housing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howaremobilehomestaxedinflorida\">How are mobile homes taxed in Florida?</h2>\n<p>According to the Florida Department of Revenue, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/gt800047.pdf\">mobile homes are taxed</a> in one of three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assessed and taxed as real property.</strong> Your manufactured home is taxed annually as real property if it's affixed to land that you own.</li>\n<li><strong>Subjected to an annual license tax.</strong> If you don’t own the land your mobile home sits on, then you must buy a mobile home decal from the DHSMV every year.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessed and taxed as tangible personal property.</strong> This tax applies if your manufactured home qualifies for the mobile home decal, but does not have a current one on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is taxed as real property, you may be eligible for <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida homestead exemption</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandmobilehomecommunityrules\">Understand mobile home community rules</h2>\n<p>If you’re aiming to live in a mobile home park, you want to read through its regulations, including bylaws if there’s a mobile homeowners’ association. These can give you a good understanding of what you’re getting into﹘especially the behaviors that may get you fined or evicted.</p>"

But square footage also impacts your tax assessments, home insurance, and even getting permits for renovations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4stepsformeasuringthesquarefootageofahouse\">4 steps for measuring the square footage of a house</h2>\n<p>If you’re measuring square footage to find out how much livable space your house has, you’ll want to take interior measurements. By measuring from the inside wall, you can get a better sense of whether or not the space meets your needs. For example, you might have a sofa that needs a certain length of wall space. If the room doesn’t have it, the sofa won’t fit.</p>\n<p>The steps for calculating the square footage of a house are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sketch each room of your house.</strong> Plotting out every room of your house, including hallways and closets, can help you tally your square footage as you go</li>\n<li><strong>Measure the length and width of each room.</strong> Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of every room in feet. This is easy when the room is rectangular or square. However, if you have oddly shaped rooms, you may want to use an <a href=\"https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/construction/square-footage-calculator.php\">online square footage calculator</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiply the length and width.</strong> For example, if your living room is 20 feet by 15 feet, its square footage is 300 square feet. Note each room’s measurement on the sketch you created in the first step.</li>\n<li><strong>Add room values together.</strong> Take the totals from each room and add them together to get the total square footage of the house. This is the usable space in your home and may be different from an appraisal or the country tax records.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a room with nooks and crannies you may need to break it down into measurable rectangles. That way, you can get the square footage of the smaller spaces and add them all together for the room’s total square footage.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say that your living room is 10-foot wide, but one wall has an odd notch at the corner that protrudes one foot into the room, like the image shown below.  <img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/square_footage.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The best way to measure the square footage for that room is to divide it into two rectangles. The first rectangle starts at the edge of the notch and goes to the other wall, and the second is the rest of the room.</p>\n<p>Some people make the mistake of calculating the square footage of a two-story home by measuring the bottom floor and simply multiplying that number by two. This can be accurate if the floor plans for each floor match exactly, but it’s incorrect for homes with two-floor entryways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howisthesquarefootageofahousecalculatedforanappraisal\">How is the square footage of a house calculated for an appraisal?</h3>\n<p>Most people who buy a house get an <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> to determine its fair market value, and one of the appraiser’s tasks is calculating the home’s square footage. The process is often similar to what you would do to measure square footage. However, your appraiser’s calculation might not match yours or even what’s on the actual listing.</p>\n<p>The most common reason the square footage may be different in your appraisal is because an appraiser needs to evaluate the total value of your home. As a result, the square footage in an appraisal may include nonliving spaces, like attics, unheated basements, and open patios.</p>\n<p>Your appraiser’s square footage calculation may more closely match what’s on county tax records, but that’s not always the case. For example, the square footage of a house may not be accurate on tax records if the owner enclosed their patio without getting permits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ishousesquarefootagemeasuredinsideorout\">Is house square footage measured inside or out?</h3>\n<p>Whether a home’s square footage is measured by the interior or exterior depends on who you ask. An interior designer and realtors who need to determine the usable space may use the interior walls. Architects, however, may use exterior walls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisincludedinthesquarefootageofahouse\">What is included in the square footage of a house?</h2>\n<p>Only usable space is included in your home’s square footage. Typically, usable space is defined as areas in your home that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share the same heating and cooling system as the main house.</li>\n<li>Are located above ground.</li>\n<li>Conform to your home’s architectural standard.</li>\n<li>Are finished and adjoining.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at it that way, it’s pretty clear that rooms like your kitchen, living room, bathrooms, and bedrooms are part of your square footage﹘as long as you don’t have to pass through unfinished spaces to reach them. The same goes for hallways, stairways, and closets. Enclosed patios may be included if they have four walls and a roof and use the same heating as the rest of your home.</p>\n<p>A finished attic can also be part of your square footage, but like enclosed patios, it usually has to share your home’s heating and cooling system. Plus, it may need a certain amount of headroom to count.</p>\n<p>Garage and basements aren’t usually included in the square footage of a house. This is often true even if the basement is finished because it’s below ground level. However, some states do allow you to include finished basements when they have safe ways to enter and exit. Detached structures such as sheds are also generally excluded from the calculations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doclosetscountassquarefootage\">Do closets count as square footage?</h3>\n<p>Closet areas are included in the square footage of a home, but only when they are in the main home. Closets in areas that aren’t considered usable space, like basements, aren’t included. When you calculate the square footage of a house, treat each individual closet as if it were a room and add it to your total.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howimportantisthesquarefootageofahouse\">How important is the square footage of a house?</h2>\n<p>Square footage can be very important when it comes to buying or selling a home. Many buyers start looking with a particular number in mind, so having an accurate measurement can help get your home in front of the right audience.</p>\n<p>However, Chief Real Estate Analyst and Managing Editor of <a href=\"https://theclose.com\">The Close</a>, Emile L’Eplattenier says that in some cases, other features can be more important than square footage. A good example in some markets is when developers decrease size in favor of amenities.</p>\n<p>“While price per square foot is still a useful metric,” says L’Eplattenier, “developers of luxury buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been decreasing average unit sizes for more than a decade now.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, homebuyers need to use the square footage of a house they’re interested in as one piece of information. It may tell them something about whether the house fits their needs, but they need to weigh other factors, like location and quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"squarefootageandhomeinsurance\">Square footage and home insurance</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies usually want to know your home’s square footage when you apply for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> because they use it to figure out how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> you need. They need to know that you’re insured for what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up. Having accurate square footage helps both you and your insurer know that you are insuring your home properly.</p>"

    body: "<p>Despite the longstanding jokes, changing a lightbulb is pretty easy and should require just one person. But figuring out how to choose a light bulb? That’s a surprisingly different story. From old-fashioned incandescent bulbs to new LED and smart bulbs, it feels like you need a team of experts to pick the best bulb for your situation.</p>\n<p>We took a dive into your options to help you better understand what's available and when to use different types of light bulbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoestherightlightbulbmatter\">Why Does the Right Light Bulb Matter?</h2>\n<p>The primary concern when choosing a light bulb is illumination. You want to have enough light to make a space functional. But you also want to think about creating the right ambiance for the room. Some bulbs produce brighter, whiter light that makes more sense in a kitchen or bathroom. Other light bulbs give off a warm, yellowish light, which may make them right for a bedroom.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you also want to think about the cost and the amount of energy a light bulb consumes. High-efficiency light bulbs are usually more expensive, but use less energy so you buy fewer of them over time. Considering the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">environmental concerns</a> facing our world, using energy efficient light bulbs may be the smart choice both for your budget and the greater good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesoflightbulbs\">Types of Light Bulbs</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the type of light bulbs you can find in your home improvement store.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incandescentlightbulbs\">Incandescent Light Bulbs</h3>\n<p>The incandescent light bulb is the original light bulb. It works by heating a filament that glows when hot. While many feel that incandescent bulbs are archaic, they’re still popular because they’re inexpensive and easy to use. People generally like that incandescent light bulbs dim easily with a simple device called a rheostat and the warm ambiance they produce compared to new technology bulbs.</p>\n<p>Incandescent bulbs saw a resurgence in popularity when Edison bulbs became a trendy lighting option. However, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set maximum power consumption that reduced the number of incandescent bulbs made. Incandescent light bulbs are still available, but many homeowners have shifted towards more energy-efficient bulbs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"halogenlightbulbs\">Halogen Light Bulbs</h3>\n<p>A halogen light bulb is similar to an incandescent bulb where current flows along a filament, heating it up until it glows. But halogens actually have an internal bulb that’s a quartz capsule filled with halogen gas. The internal system used by halogen bulbs means that they are able to reuse the elements internally and last longer﹘up to 4,000 hours compared to just 750 to 2,000 hours for incandescent bulb.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compactfluorescentlampcflbulbs\">Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) Bulbs</h3>\n<p>CFL bulbs were the first wave in light bulb technology that produced a high light output while helping conserve energy. As the name suggests, this is a fluorescent bulb that lasts longer than traditional incandescent bulbs. In fact, they are thought to last ten times longer than incandescent bulbs, making the case for their more expensive purchase price.</p>\n<p>Homeowners like CFL bulbs for the savings over time but also because they can use CFLs in hard-to-reach sockets where changing more frequently can prove challenging. However, the early versions produced harsh light that turned many people off. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cfl/what-are-connections-between-mercury-and-cfls\">CFL bulbs contain a tiny amount of mercury</a> that can be released if the bulb is broken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightemittingdiodeledbulbs\">Light Emitting Diode (LED) Bulbs</h3>\n<p>LED bulbs are taking over the aisles in many home improvement stores. These bulbs are nearly 90 percent more efficient than incandescent bulbs and they last up to 50,000 hours. On top of their ability to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce your energy bill</a>, LEDs don’t contain mercury and they come in a variety of shapes and styles.</p>\n<p>You can also get internet-capable LED bulbs, called smart bulbs, that can turn on and off, dim or brighten, and even change color depending on how you program them. These benefits make LED lights a popular choice with homeowners, despite the steep upfront costs. The price, however, is balanced out by the energy savings over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wattagevslumensexplained\">Wattage vs. Lumens Explained</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, light bulbs were sold based on wattage. You’d go out to buy a 60- or 80-watt bulb, knowing that the higher wattage meant a brighter bulb. But wattage describes electricity consumption so as more energy-efficient bulbs came to market, wattage became a less useful description for light bulbs. After all, new light bulbs use less energy to provide the same, if not more, light.</p>\n<p>This is where measuring lumens is important. Lumens are the amount of light generated by a light bulb. Incandescent bulbs produce approximately 15 lumens per watt, and LEDs produce about 60 lumens per watt, so it uses less energy to provide more light. Understanding this helps you decide how many light bulbs to buy. But remember﹘fixtures have safety ratings that limit the number of watts they can take. Never use a bulb that exceeds a fixture’s safety rating.</p>\n<p>The table below is a light bulb wattage guide. Across the top, it lists four common light bulbs (incandescent, halogen, CFL, and LED) with the wattage you’d need to get the lumens listed in the far left column.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightbulbwattageguide\">Light Bulb Wattage Guide</h3>\n<p>| Lumens | Incandescent | Halogen | CFL | LED |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 220 | 25w | 18w | 5w | 4.5w |\n| 410 | 40w | 28w | 8w | 9w |\n| 700 | 60w | 42w | 12w | 13w |\n| 920 | 75w | 53w | 15w | 13w |\n| 1330 | 100w | 70w | 20w | 18w |</p>\n<p><em>Source: Display Smart, LLC.</em> <a href=\"https://www.display-smart.com/understanding-display-case-led-lighting-terminology/\"><em>Understanding Display Case LED Lighting Terminology</em></a> Sept. 24, 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherthingstoconsiderwhenpickingalightbulb\">Other Things to Consider When Picking a Light Bulb</h2>\n<p>Knowing the different types of bulbs is just step one to picking the right one for you. The next is to think about where you need light, how much light that area needs, and what kind of fixtures you have available to you. Your answers to these questions can help you choose a light bulb with the right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color and brightness.</strong> Even white light can produce different colors. These generally fall between a soft, yellow to a neutral white to a bright, slightly bluish light. Certain rooms, like kitchens, garages, and bathrooms, often need bright, whiter light.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixtures.</strong> Light bulbs can react differently to heat. LEDs, for example, are sensitive to heat and might not work well or last as long in recessed or enclosed fixtures. Fixtures also have safety ratings, so you need to buy light bulbs that do not exceed the watt limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Fitting.</strong> The most common fitting is the Edison screw where a bulb with a threaded base screws into a matching socket. However, halogen and LED bulbs may have GU10 fittings, which are installed with a light push and slight turn. You should also note that not every light bulb is compatible with a dimmer, so be sure to check before you buy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LED light bulbs seem like a clear winner in many situations because they’re cost effective and versatile. That said, you may find them less useful if you have particular fixtures or require certain fittings.</p>"

    body: "<p>Home insurance is a necessity for nearly every homeowner, but it's often an afterthought. The home buying process is stressful!</p>\n<p>Deductibles? Other structures? Monthly premiums may be enough for homeowners to simply purchase from a well-known provider and move on with their day.</p>\n<p>This strategy is a mistake. Homeowners insurance policies across providers aren’t created equal. Understanding how to compare insurance companies is key to avoiding paying for a policy that doesn’t cover what you need.</p>\n<p>This post will teach you how to do just that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparingcoverage\">Comparing coverage</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies include dwelling insurance (Coverage A), which covers the costs of repairing your home’s main structure. Home insurance also includes additional coverages (Coverages B-F), such as other structures, personal property, and medical coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"coveragelimits\">Coverage limits</h3>\n<p>Coverage limits are calculated as a <a href=\"https://www.consumeraffairs.com/insurance/home.html\">percentage of your Dwelling Insurance coverage</a>, which typically range around the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ten percent for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other Structures Insurance (Coverage B)</a> - This varies widely based on the presence or absence of a detached garage.</li>\n<li>Twenty to forty percent for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal Property Insurance (Coverage C)</a> - This can also vary widely. Make sure to keep a home inventory and track the valuable items you'd need replaced in the event of a loss.</li>\n<li>Twenty percent for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use Insurance (Coverage D)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Limits that aren’t related to Dwelling Insurance typically range around the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$300,000-$500,000 for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability Insurance (Coverage E)</a></li>\n<li>$1,000-$5,000 for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments Insurance (Coverage F)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Comparison is key: Costs vary from state-to-state, and even region to region, for the same provider.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"coverageexclusions\">Coverage exclusions</h3>\n<p>Limits aside, homeowners need to understand that some events aren’t covered at all by their policies. Again, most exclusions are similar across providers (e.g. <a href=\"/flood-insurance\">flood insurance</a>), though there can be significant differences depending on your situation.</p>\n<p>Most standard home insurance policies won’t cover the following events or items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional property structures used for business</li>\n<li>Cash</li>\n<li>Floods (most often requires a separate policy)</li>\n<li>Hail/Windstorm Damage (most often requires a separate policy)</li>\n<li>High-value items like art, furs, and jewelry</li>\n<li>Pool Deaths</li>\n<li>Trampolines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of these apply to you, speak with different providers to see how you can expand your policy to cover them. In most cases, you’ll be required to pay a higher premium or deductible in exchange for coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparingcosts\">Comparing costs</h2>\n<p>While coverage should be a top factor when <a href=\"https://www.reviews.com/homeowners-insurance/\">comparing homeowners insurance companies</a>, there’s no denying the importance of cost. Homeowners spend on average $1,228 a year on home insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Even if you’re planning on sticking with the same provider after moving out-of-state, it’s worth doing more research. Costs vary from state-to-state, and even region to region, for the same provider. Some providers specialize in specific regions (Kin, for example, specializes in insurance for Florida and Texas homeowners).</p>\n<p>When comparing costs, the three factors to keep in mind are deductibles, premiums, and discounts. Let’s take a deeper dive into them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deductiblesandpremiums\">Deductibles and premiums</h3>\n<p>Deductibles are the out-of-pocket costs that homeowners are responsible for paying before the insurance provider steps in. These can vary within a single policy depending on the type of claim being filed. For example, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">claims filed due to a hurricane</a> may be subject to a higher “hurricane deductible,” as is the case in Florida.</p>\n<p>Premiums are the monthly payments made to your home insurance company for your policy. Many factors go into determining your premium costs, including location, personal history, and characteristics of your home (size, building materials, etc.).</p>\n<p>The basic rule of thumb is that raising your deductible will lower your monthly premium and vice-versa. In other words, the more money you put up now in premiums, the less you pay when it comes time to file a claim.</p>\n<p>While this may sound tempting, every homeowner must realize the risk of a lower premium: in the event of a disaster, you can’t get around paying the deductible. This could put you in a tight spot if you find yourself short of the needed deductible payment for the insurance company to pay the rest.</p>\n<p>Homeowners should choose a deductible that's an amount they're comfortable paying out-of-pocket in an emergency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"discounts\">Discounts</h3>\n<p>When comparing insurance costs, be sure to ask companies about available insurance discounts you can take on your policy. Home features, personal lifestyle, and other factors are used to determine your qualification. Available <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/home-insurance-discounts-for-you.aspx\">discounts may include</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Home Discounts: Some companies may give you a discount simply by purchasing a policy when moving into your new home.</li>\n<li>Home Safety Discounts: Having certain home safety features, such as smoke or burglar alarms, installed in your home can qualify you for discounts.</li>\n<li>Weather Preparation Discounts: Storm shutters, hail-resistant roofs, and other home improvements can reduce your home’s risk. Providers will oftentimes take note.</li>\n<li>Loyalty Discounts: Whether you’ve stayed with a provider for several years or have bundled your home insurance with other policies (e.g. auto, life), providers will offer discounts to those who’ve remained loyal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"comparingclaimpayouts\">Comparing claim payouts</h2>\n<p>Homeowners put up with premiums and deductibles because they believe their insurance policy will cover what’s needed come time to file a claim. Once the deductible is paid, their provider will step in and take care of everything else… right?</p>\n<p>The answer isn’t clear-cut. While companies will pay out once a claim has been accepted, the exact amount will vary. Claim adjustments and processing times can also affect when and how much payment you’ll receive, potentially placing you in a difficult spot in an already difficult time.</p>\n<p>To avoid being caught in limbo while waiting for payment, be sure to ask providers about the following:</p>\n<h3 id=\"paymentmethod\">Payment method</h3>\n<p>Home insurance policies can use different methods to calculate payments to homeowners (just another reason to know your policy inside and out!). The most common methods are <strong>actual cost</strong> and <strong>replacement cost</strong>.</p>\n<p>Actual cost calculates payment based on the <em>current</em> value of your home, building materials, or other items included in your claim. Insurance providers use depreciation to determine current value, meaning your payments will most likely not cover the costs to repair or replace what you need.</p>\n<p>However, replacement cost means the policy will pay the amount needed to fully repair or replace what’s needed using the same or comparable materials. Replacement cost policies typically require higher premium payments, though it may be worth it depending on your home’s structure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"claimsprocess\">Claims process</h3>\n<p>Even if you have a well-paying policy, the claims process may prove to be a headache to deal with. Some providers may take a long time to process claims due to a large, bureaucratic process. In the event of a natural disaster, the surge of homeowners filing claims may also slow down response time.</p>\n<p>Coupled with claims processing is the claims adjustment, which is required before payments can be made. Insurance companies will oftentimes send out their own adjuster, who then assesses the damage and gives an estimate for cleanup and repairs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparingratingsandcustomerservice\">Comparing ratings and customer service</h2>\n<p>Even after you’ve compared coverage, costs, and payouts, you should always consider what others have had to say about your potential providers. What if a provider that offered you a discount ends up having horrible customer service, making them a nightmare to deal with?</p>\n<p>What if they’ve had trouble paying out claims before?</p>\n<h3 id=\"ratingagenciesandonlinereviews\">Rating agencies and online reviews</h3>\n<p>Rather than taking the risk and having your own bad experience, turn to <a href=\"/blog/-financial-ratings/\">financial ratings from rating agencies</a> and reviews on customer service sites to gauge the quality of a provider. Organizations like Consumer Affairs and Better Business Bureau give reviews of insurance companies and allow for customer comments.</p>\n<p>When reading reviews and comments, homeowners should keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is the provider’s customer service run? For regional or national providers, is support centralized in one location or localized to better serve customers? This could affect hours of availability.</li>\n<li>How can homeowners get in touch with customer support? Can they call in and speak to a representative, or is everything done via email or online chat?</li>\n<li>What’s the provider’s financial status like? Ratings from organizations like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners can provide insight into the financial strength of the provider. Can the provider manage to pay out all claims in the event of a disaster?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"regularlyreviewyourpolicyandcompany\">Regularly review your policy and company</h2>\n<p>Circumstances always change. Perhaps over time you purchased some new high-end items. Maybe you decided to build an addition onto your home or redo your roof. All of these could affect your needed coverage limits or eligibility for discounts.</p>\n<p>Even if you’ve found a great homeowners insurance provider, we recommend to regularly review your policy and company (e.g. annually). By keeping track any changes to your home or family, you can ensure you always have the right coverage and the right provider for your situation.</p>\n<p>You never know, maybe there are other companies out there that can beat your current provider on costs, customer service, and more. Maybe a company like Kin just could be the provider you’ve been searching for.</p>"

    body: "<p>Have you checked your energy bill? Chances you saw a bit of a spike last month. Even if you went without holiday lights, you probably used a lot of energy just trying to keep your house warm.</p>\n<p>If your utility bills are causing sticker shock, then now may be the time to make your home more eco-friendly. Doing this not only helps lower your energy costs, but it can combat climate change. We’ve come up with three options for making a more energy-efficient home to help homeowners go green this winter. Take a look!</p>\n<h2 id=\"installsolarpanels\">Install solar panels</h2>\n<p>The typical American household uses <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3\">10,632 kilowatt-hours</a> (kWh) of electricity per year, or approximately 886 kWh each month. But during the winter, that can jump to <a href=\"https://www.katoelectrical.com/blog-1/power-use-in-the-winter\">3,100 kWh</a> per month. An increase in usage like that often translates into skyrocketing energy bills.</p>\n<p>Solar panels are an effective way to combat this cost. When they’re properly installed, residential solar panels reduce the amount of energy being produced in your home and can save you up to <a href=\"https://seedscientific.com/why-is-my-electric-bill-so-high-with-solar-panels/\">90% on monthly electricity bills</a>. That’s true even in the winter because solar panels rely strictly on sunlight to produce electricity. As long as there’s light, they’ll work no matter how cold it is outside.</p>\n<p>Before you switch to solar, however, you’ll want to do some research. There are four different <a href=\"https://www.rocketsolar.com/learn/solar-basics/solar-panels-for-home\">home solar panel systems</a> you can choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grid-tied systems that are permanently connected to your local utility’s power grid so you can supplement your solar energy.</li>\n<li>Off-grid systems that aren’t connected to a power grid.</li>\n<li>Grid-tied systems with back-up solar batteries.</li>\n<li>Solar leases that you rent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each has its own benefits, but ultimately it’s up to you to decide the best fit for your home. You’ll also want to think about your <a href=\"/blog/how-long-do-roofs-last/\">roof material</a> and shape. Some roofs are better for solar panels than others. You’ll also want to pay attention to the price. Installing solar panels can be expensive, costing anywhere between $15,000 to $31,000 depending on the model you choose.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration? Your insurance. Homeowners policies <a href=\"/faq/solar-panel-insurance/\">typically cover solar panels</a> you own that are permanently attached to your roof. Solar leases may require separate coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"useasmartthermostat\">Use a smart thermostat</h2>\n<p>Cold temperatures affect most of the country throughout the winter, making heating systems necessary to heat an entire house. But traditional heating systems can eat up a lot of energy. The average electric furnace uses <a href=\"https://news.energysage.com/how-many-watts-does-an-electric-furnace-use/\">182 kWh</a> every week. Worse? You may even be wasting energy if your furnace runs when you don’t need it.</p>\n<p>One solution is to install a smart thermostat. By automatically lowering the temperature in your home when you don’t need it – or even letting you monitor it remotely! – these thermostats help use your home's energy more sustainably and reduce your energy bill.</p>\n<p>These days, there are a ton of options to choose from, but ultimately, you have three main <a href=\"https://thecoolingco.com/what-are-the-types-of-smart-thermostats/\">types of smart thermostats</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motion sensor.</strong> Similar to motion detection lights, smart thermostats with motion sensors activate when they recognize when someone is in your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Geofencing.</strong> This type of smart thermostat creates a “fence” around your home. When you go beyond the fence, the thermostat adjusts the temperature in your house to help save energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning algorithms.</strong> Typically, you need to program your schedule into this type of smart thermostat so over time it can learn your living pattern and adjust the temperature automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installation may cost a few hundred dollars, but the savings usually make the upfront costs worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosereusablematerials\">Choose reusable materials</h2>\n<p>People may not realize how much waste they create during the holidays. On average, Americans throw away <a href=\"https://lbre.stanford.edu/pssistanford-recycling/frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-holiday-waste-prevention\">25% more trash</a> from Thanksgiving to New Year, including plastic cups, plastic silverware, paper plates, and more.</p>\n<p>You can reduce the amount of waste you generate by using more reusable materials. For example, you could opt for mugs when you drink hot chocolate or coffee and real silverware and plates for when you have family over for the holidays.</p>\n<p>Switching to reusable materials means you’ll not just cut down on unnecessary waste and ultimately lower your carbon footprint, but you’ll save you money in the long run. Constantly replacing single-use items is expensive – even if you buy cheap things you don’t mind tossing.</p>\n<p>Using real silverware and plates is an easy fix to use instead of buying one-use materials. It saves you money in the long run from constantly replacing plastic and paper materials while simultaneously protecting the environment from added waste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomlineongoinggreenthiswinter\">The bottom line on going green this winter</h2>\n<p>Environmental concerns may not be the first thing that comes to mind in the middle of winter, but taking care of the earth is something we can do all year round. While these tips may not be for all households, we encourage everyone to look for ways to go green this season.</p>"

    body: "<p>Whether you want to make some small aesthetic updates to your home or have a big remodeling project planned, hiring a good contractor is a must. But how do you know what to look for? What makes a contractor trustworthy? This guide will help you zero in on the traits of a quality contractor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretosearchforahomeimprovementcontractor\">Where to Search for a Home Improvement Contractor</h2>\n<p>Ask your neighbors, friends, and family for their recommendations. If they’ve hired someone to do a home improvement project in the past, they can tell you from firsthand experience if they were satisfied with the work and what you can expect. They can also tip you off on who <em>not</em> to hire, in some cases.</p>\n<p>If your network doesn’t have recommendations for you, explore potential candidates online. Platforms like Thumbtack and <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/\">Angie’s List</a> can give you insight into the contractor’s experience, licensing information, past projects, and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Give yourself some options so you can compare offers on your project and leverage lower bids. A pool of three contractors is usually a good starting point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contractorcredentialchecklist\">Contractor credential checklist</h2>\n<p>Once you have a list of contractors, prepare some interview questions so you can learn more about who the contractor is and why you should trust them with your home. For example, you might ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have a license?</strong> A license insures the contractor knows the appropriate codes and processes to safely and effectively work on your home. Write down your contractor’s license number and look it up on your state’s license board.</li>\n<li><strong>Are you bonded and insured?</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> lists whether your contractor is insured and bonded. You can also ask to see their certificate of liability insurance (this document is readily available to insureds). This protects you if the contractor doesn’t finish the project because you can make a claim on their coverage to reimburse you for losses.</li>\n<li><strong>What kind of work do you specialize in?</strong> Contractor may specialize in an array of trades, from electrical work or carpentry to roofing or landscaping. Make sure your potential contractor has the expertise your project requires.</li>\n<li><strong>Can you provide a list of previous clients?</strong> A reputable contractor is usually happy to share their references.</li>\n<li><strong>Where are you based?</strong> Look for a local contractor – their ties to the community may mean they will care about maintaining a good reputation. Ask for their business address for proof of their location.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"projectspecificquestionstoaskyourcontractor\">Project-specific questions to ask your contractor</h2>\n<p>In addition to asking questions about their professional background, licensing, insurance, and expertise, you should ask logistical questions about the project. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you take on projects of this size?</strong> Some contractors only have one or two workers so may not be equipped to take on a big project. By contrast, some contractors may only be interested in doing big remodels rather than small repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have photos of similar finished work?</strong> Most skilled contractors are proud to show proof of past projects, whether that's a full kitchen remodel, underground <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool</a> installation, or a new patio deck.</li>\n<li><strong>How many other projects would you work on at the same time?</strong> This will give you insight into whether they will be responsive to your needs and adhere to the project timeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Are your subcontractors insured?</strong> Everyone working on the project should have insurance to safeguard you against financial loss in case they deliver incomplete or subpar work.</li>\n<li><strong>Can you obtain permits?</strong> Contractors may wish to avoid getting permits for smaller projects, but a permit ensures they are able to comply with local building codes. It’s important for their safety and your security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatahomeimprovementcontractshouldinclude\">What a home improvement contract should include</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve settled on a contractor, it’s time to review the contract. A professional project contract will usually address the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The contractor’s name, address, phone, and license number.</li>\n<li>A estimated start and completion date to ensure project is completed on time.</li>\n<li>The payment schedule to ensure transparency.</li>\n<li>Obligation to get permits to ensure legal compliance.</li>\n<li>What happens if you decide to make a change in the scope of the project.</li>\n<li>Materials and allowances to avoid surprise extra expenses.</li>\n<li>Warranties that protect your interests.</li>\n<li>Cleanup clauses so you know what to expect after the project is finished.</li>\n<li>Your ability to sever the relationship if the contractor violates the rules of the contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are worried about being able to pay on time, make sure a payment plan is included in your contract. Otherwise, the contractor may be able to take out a lien, or real estate debt, against you for themselves and their subcontractors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contractorredflags\">Contractor red flags</h2>\n<p>Home improvement scammers are prevalent, which is why it’s so important to check references. No homeowner wants work done by an amateur or a fly-by-night operation. Follow the suggestions above and watch out for these red flags to avoid a potential scam:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have lousy reviews or outdated references.</li>\n<li>They are slow to respond.</li>\n<li>They ask for too much money upfront.</li>\n<li>They ask you to get the required building permits.</li>\n<li>They don’t show proof of their bond and insurance.</li>\n<li>Their bond and/or insurance is expired.</li>\n<li>They seem impatient, cut you off, or don’t listen to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hiring the right contractor will have a significant impact on whether your home improvement project is a smooth or frustrating experience. When in doubt, do your research and due diligence, but also trust your instincts. At the end of the day, you have to trust the person you hire, and there’s no one answer for that.</p>\n<p>And remember, when you update your home, you may need to make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> still adequately protects your property. Plus, if your upgrades make your home safer (say, a new roof with <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane</a> clips or wind mitigation system), you may even qualify for <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">premium discounts</a>. Talk to your insurer for details.</p>"

    body: "<p>Freezing pipes are one of the most common home insurance claims in the winter. In fact, along with internal water damage, they are the <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">third most common claim</a> and cost about $10,849 to repair on average.</p>\n<p>As the water in the pipes freeze, it expands and creates pressure, which can rupture the pipe. As the ice in the pipes melts, it can cause water damage throughout the home.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what has happened to countless Texan homes mid-February when a winter storm and hard freeze swept unexpectedly through the state and caused massive power outages. The <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/burst-pipes-plumbers-texas/\">Insurance Council of Texas</a> stated, “We expect the claims for frozen, busted pipes to be unlike any event the state has experienced.”</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can cover repairing a burst pipe and subsequent water damage, it’s helpful to know how to prevent it in the first place if you’re able. So let’s take a look at how to keep pipes from freezing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1insulatethepipes\">1. Insulate the pipes</h2>\n<p>There are many reasons for the tragic situation in Texas. Among them, many Texas homes aren’t winterized because winters in the South are usually mild. When temperatures do drop, heating in the homes is typically enough to keep freezing at bay. Because the power failed, many homeowners couldn’t prepare in time.</p>\n<p>But how do you insulate pipes if you have the chance? Start with exposed pipes under cabinets, in basements, and in the garage. Many hardware stores sell easy-to-install insulation like pipe sleeves. This helps keep the temperature of the pipe more regulated, though it won’t prevent every disaster. If you’re in a pinch and need to insulate a pipe quickly, roll a quarter inch of newspaper around the pipe.</p>\n<p>You can also insulate the rooms where pipes are – areas like attics and basements. This will help keep the overall temperature in the room warmer and reduce the likelihood of your pipes freezing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2sealupcracksandholesnearpipes\">2. Seal up cracks and holes near pipes</h2>\n<p>Cracks and holes let cold drafts in. During freezing temperatures, the last thing you want is cold air on your pipes. Solve this problem by sealing up any cracks, holes, and gaps under cabinets near your pipes.</p>\n<p>When possible, seal both the interior and exterior so that the draft is completely blocked. You can use spray foam insulation to get the job done quickly and efficiently. For smaller cracks where spray foam insulation won’t work, use caulk. This will seal the areas and can be smoothed out for neatness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3applyheatingtape\">3. Apply heating tape</h2>\n<p>If insulation is like a down blanket for your pipes, heating tape is an electric blanket. Heating tape is perfect for accessible pipes that need extra insulation from the cold weather. There are two types of heating tape: one that turns on and off by itself and one that has a manual switch.</p>\n<p>This adds necessary heat to the pipes to prevent freezing. Be careful using it, though. For your safety, follow the product’s instructions to prevent accidental fires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4runthefaucet\">4. Run the faucet</h2>\n<p>Running water doesn’t freeze. Fortunately, you don’t have to turn the water on full blast to get the benefits of running water. Turning faucets on so that there is a consistent drip is usually enough to prevent the pipe from freezing and bursting.</p>\n<p>Make sure to run both the faucet’s hot and cold water so that you don’t have one side freeze. If you have single-handle faucets like most kitchens, set the water to run warm so that an equal amount of hot and cold water goes through.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5keepcabinetdoorsopen\">5. Keep cabinet doors open</h2>\n<p>Areas under cabinets tend to get and stay cold because there’s no extra warm air circulating under the sink. Open cabinet doors so that the warmth of the room can help warm under the sink. Do this in your kitchen and bathrooms to make sure these areas get the benefit of the household’s warm air.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6keeptheheaton\">6. Keep the heat on</h2>\n<p>Keep the heat on in the house to keep pipes warm. You don’t need a full 75 degrees in the house during the winter, but if you plan on leaving for an extended period of time, keep the heat above 50 degrees Fahrenheit to help prevent freezing pipes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtothawafrozenpipe\">How to thaw a frozen pipe</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you can’t stop a pipe from freezing. If you come home to barely a trickle of water coming from your faucets, you may need to apply heat to the pipes sending water to the faucet. You can do this with a hair dryer, a portable space heater, or by wrapping towels soaked in hot water around the pipes.</p>\n<p>When heating pipes with things like a dryer or space heater, make sure to keep flammable materials away from the heat source to prevent a fire. Never, ever use a blowtorch, propane or kerosene heater, or any open flame to thaw your pipes.</p>\n<p>As the pipe is thawing, keep the faucet on to allow the water to flow through.</p>\n<p>If warming a pipe doesn’t resolve your water pressure problems, you likely have a frozen pipe somewhere you can’t easily access. If that’s the case, call a plumber for help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frozenpipesandhomeinsurance\">Frozen pipes and home insurance</h2>\n<p>Whether you have homeowners, condo, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>, these policies typically do cover frozen pipe damage (but ask your insurance representative to make sure!). That’s good news – frozen and burst pipes can cause thousands of dollars worth of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> to your home and your belongings. That’s especially true if the pipe bursts when you’re away from home and can’t catch the problem when it first happens.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"/claims/\">make a claim</a>, first turn the water off to stop the damage from escalating. Then call your insurance provider to report the event. Get personal belongings on shelves or surfaces where water can’t damage them. Take pictures of the problem and make sure the claims specialist has a list of all damaged items.</p>\n<p>While you’ll still need a plumber to fix the actual busted pipe right away, your policy can cover your damaged cabinets, flooring, walls, and personal belongings up to the coverage limits.</p>"

    body: "<p>Anyone can <em>make</em> New Year’s resolutions. The real trick is figuring out how to <em>keep</em> New Year’s resolutions, right? But truthfully, a resolution is like any other goal. You need to decide what you want to accomplish and develop a plan to get it done.</p>\n<p>Whether you want to run a marathon, finally <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">stop killing your houseplants</a>, or <a href=\"/blog/saving-tips-first-time-homeowners/\">start saving for your first home</a>, you can make resolutions that actually stick. We’ve put together a few tips to help you set you off on the right path.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startwiththerightresolution\">Start with the Right Resolution</h2>\n<p>Becky Moore from <a href=\"https://globalgrasshopper.com/\">Global Grasshopper</a> believes that New Year’s resolutions are about “accepting responsibility for the things in your life that need improvement” and “owning the fact that you aren’t perfect, but that you can be better.” With this in mind, there are several types of resolutions you may want to avoid, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resolutions that come from someone else.</strong> Don’t pick a goal based on what others tell you that you need to do. If your family says you need to lose weight but you really don’t want to do it, you’ll have a hard time committing to that goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolutions that you haven’t carefully considered.</strong> Before you set a New Year’s resolution, figure out what really matters to you. People show more resiliency when working towards goals that reflect their truest selves.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolutions for the sake of having a resolution.</strong> Making a resolution simply because it’s New Year’s Eve and that’s what we do may be the surest way to guarantee failure. Again, if you’re not truly motivated by your goal, you’re going to have a hard time reaching it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"setsmartresolutions\">Set S.M.A.R.T. Resolutions</h2>\n<p>Entrepreneur Athena Oanessian, founder of You Squared, says it’s important to use the S.M.A.R.T. method for setting goals because it helps you think through your goals and understand what you need to achieve them.</p>\n<p>S.M.A.R.T. stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specific.</strong> Be explicit about what you want to accomplish. For example, “save money for a home” is a great goal, but a more specific goal includes the who, what, where, when, and why. Your ultimate goal might be “My spouse and I will buy a home in our neighborhood by the end of the year so we can have more space.”</li>\n<li><strong>Measurable.</strong> Quantifying your resolution (e.g., I will put an extra 10 percent from every paycheck towards buying a house) helps you track your progress and stay motivated.</li>\n<li><strong>Achievable.</strong> You want to ask yourself if your resolution is truly realistic given your time and resources. So if buying a home is your goal, then you may want to assess your current financial situation to see what you can afford.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant.</strong> Another important question to ask yourself is what does this goal mean to you. Are you buying a home because it’s what people are supposed to do or because it's something you really want? Does it fit your other life goals?</li>\n<li><strong>Timely.</strong> Creating a deadline for your goal, whether it’s a few months out or by the end of the year, can help keep you on track and give you space to create small, bite-sized goals. For example, you may want to buy a house by the end of the year, but maybe you need to raise your credit score first.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"breakyourresolutionintosmallgoals\">Break Your Resolution into Small Goals</h2>\n<p>Small, incremental steps are a good way to make progress toward one big resolution, according to Emily Mendez of <a href=\"https://www.theohanahawaii.com/\">The Ohana Addiction Treatment Center</a>, so she recommends breaking your resolutions down into several small steps.</p>\n<p>For example, if your resolution is to buy a home, then smaller goals like fixing your credit score or <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">researching mortgages</a> get you moving in the right direction. Making progress is also good for staying motivated. “We tend to give up on goals that we don’t see results right away on,” says Mendez.</p>\n<p>And as you progress, Bracha Goetz of <a href=\"http://www.goetzbookshop.com\">Bracha’s Books</a> points out that celebrating your victories, even if they’re just small steps toward your bigger goal, can increase your “gratitude and sense of abundance in life.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"writedownyourresolution\">Write Down Your Resolution</h2>\n<p>Cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.textel.net\">Textel</a> James Diel advises anyone who wants to keep a New Year’s resolution to “plan adequately by putting pen to paper and writing down not just your goals, but the strategy itself.” Writing your resolution down helps to clarify both your purpose and your method.</p>\n<p>Your next step may be to place your written resolutions somewhere that you can see them often, like your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. This gives you a constant reminder that may steel your resolve when obstacles get between you and your goal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"knowthattherewillbehurdles\">Know That There Will be Hurdles</h2>\n<p>The road to any successful resolution includes obstacles and missteps, so you need to understand that change is a process and that you’ll have days when you fall short. When that happens, Samantha Moss of <a href=\"https://romantific.com/about/\">Romaticific.com</a> encourages you to remember that, “Your resolution doesn’t end when you commit one mistake or engage in something you restrict yourself from. Let yourself adjust little by little.”</p>\n<p>The best piece of advice we can give? Be patient. Most <a href=\"/blog/new-years-resolutions-homeowners/\">New Year’s resolutions</a> are about changing habits, and that takes planning and time.</p>"

    body: "<p>Power outages may not be high on your list of concerns in the grand scheme of things. However, they disrupt essential services throughout a community, such as communications and transportation. They can also mean your refrigerator, air conditioning, medical devices, and water all stop working.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it looks like we may be in for more power outages this summer. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/NERC_SRA_2022.pdf\">issued a report</a> last month about the energy emergencies we may see during this summer. The report lists the Midwest, Texas, and Southern California as the areas with the most concern, but electrical disruptions can occur anywhere. Long story short? Everyone should learn how to prep for a power outage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcausespoweroutages\">What causes power outages?</h2>\n<p>Some of the most common causes of power outages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extreme heat.</strong> High temperatures increase wildfire risk that can cause downed transmission lines. Droughts can also wreak havoc with energy in areas that rely on hydropower.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather.</strong> Heat isn’t the only weather event that might cause a power outage. High winds, lightning, and ice can too. In some cases, utilities shut off power in the interest of public safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Equipment failure.</strong> Aging equipment can fail all on its own, but anything from a runaway car to a mischievous squirrel can cause damage and power outages.</li>\n<li><strong>High demand.</strong> The summer months often mean more people using air conditioning, and that can cause supply shortages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, being without power is inconvenient. But when it’s brought on by extreme weather conditions or goes on for a long time, a blackout can be a major problem. Here’s our tips on how to prepare for power outages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeapoweroutage\">What to do before a power outage</h2>\n<p>It’s important to develop a plan ahead of a blackout so that you aren’t left scrambling for the things you need. For example, you might want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Put together a disaster kit.</strong> Your <a href=\"https://example.com\">emergency preparedness kit</a> might include items like flashlights, batteries, cash, first aid supplies, and an emergency radio.</li>\n<li><strong>Get alternative charging methods for your electronics</strong>. Emergency radios, cell phone chargers, and flashlights are often solar-powered or use a hand crank. Another option for your phone is a battery pack that you keep charged and ready.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy a gas-powered generator.</strong> According to Goal Zero, <a href=\"https://www.goalzero.com/pages/consumer-power-report-pdf\">61% of people want a reliable backup energy source</a>, but only 15% actually have one. </li>\n<li><strong>Have “extras” on hand.</strong> Extra batteries seem pretty obvious, but you may also want bags of ice in case you need to use a cooler and extra gas for your generator.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep a full tank of gas.</strong> Gas pumps require electricity, and you want to have enough gas in your car to get you to safety should the need arise. While you’re checking your fuel gauge, take a minute to learn how to use the manual release lever on your electric garage door.</li>\n<li><strong>Sign up for local alerts</strong>. Your area may have a notification system that texts you with emergency information, like where you can find warming or cooling shelters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whattododuringapoweroutage\">What to do during a power outage</h2>\n<p>Power outages can be risky situations. They disrupt your routine and can leave you quite literally in the dark. Here are some ways you can reduce the chance of problems for your family and home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose battery-operated lights</strong>. Candlelight is lovely, but using a flashlight or lantern minimizes your risk of a fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Turn off all outlets except for one light.</strong> This lessens the likelihood of you overloading your circuits and damaging electronics if a <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a> runs through the house when the electricity goes back on.</li>\n<li><strong>Move to lower levels.</strong> During hot summer months, you may be able to stay cool by hanging out in the lower levels of your house. If not, consider going to a cooling shelter or shopping mall that is powered by backup generators to avoid dangerous heat.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep generators outside.</strong> This can limit fire risk and help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. The same goes for charcoal grills and camp stoves. And never use a gas stove to heat your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit trips to the refrigerator.</strong> Most freezers can keep their temperature for around 48 hours, but your fridge may only keep food cold for about four hours. Limiting the number of times you open and close your refrigerator door can help keep food from spoiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One important item to note: your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> most likely only covers power outage claims if the source of the outage originated on your property.

    body: "<p>If it seems like hurricanes are getting worse, you’re not imagining it.</p>\n<p>Oceans are heating up, and that heat is affecting when and how storms form, as well as how they behave. While scientific models offer mixed predictions about how warming oceans are likely to affect the total number of hurricanes, they point to a <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00539.1\">45 to 87 percent increase</a> in the number of Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes – that is, those with the highest <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php?\">wind speeds</a>, which tend to be most destructive.</p>\n<p>While hurricanes themselves are changing, the best ways to prepare are not. Here, we’ll outline how to prepare for a hurricane before hurricane season and right before a storm. You'll also find tips on what you can do after the storm to reduce damage and return to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeahurricaneseasonalprep\">What to do before a hurricane: Seasonal prep</h2>\n<p>Hurricane preparation involves more than stashing a few gallons of water in the pantry and hoping for the best, so if you can, prepare well in advance of hurricane season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1makeahurricaneevacuationplan\">1. Make a hurricane evacuation plan</h3>\n<p>Most experts recommend making an evacuation plan before any actual hurricane is in the forecast. Acting early helps ensure that your plan is rational and well thought out, rather than an emotional response to the fear that a hurricane in the forecast can cause.</p>\n<p>Before you begin, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts\">Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> (WEAs) provided by the government are turned on, and <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/knowyourzone/\">check to see whether you’re in an evacuation zone</a> so you know ahead of time what to expect in the event of a storm.</p>\n<p>Make sure you evacuation plan outlines the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your evacuation route</strong>. Buy a relevant paper map in case digital communications are out when you have to evacuate.</li>\n<li><strong>Arrangements for where you’ll stay</strong>. This might mean making a primary plan to stay with friends or family who live out of the danger zone and a shelter fallback plan. If a storm is already looming and you can’t evacuate in time, have your <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/shelters/\">county’s shelter information</a> on hand. As you plan, don’t forget to accommodate your <a href=\"/blog/pet-insurance/\">pets</a>: remember that some shelters won’t take pets and that it’s best for yours to have all relevant paperwork with them (vaccination information, insurance documents, medical records, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>When you’ll evacuate</strong>. While it’s fine to wait until official channels issue an <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">evacuation order</a>, certain groups may wish to evacuate sooner to ensure they have plenty of time to get where they’re going. If you or someone you’ll be traveling with is elderly, has special needs, is pregnant, or is sick, you may want to plan an early evacuation to keep everyone safe. Those who live in mobile homes or low-lying coastal areas should generally evacuate early, and those who will be towing large vehicles may have to, as high winds can make driving these vehicles dangerous.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have a plan in place, communicate it with your household and any folks you plan to stay with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2gatherevacuationessentials\">2. Gather evacuation essentials</h3>\n<p>When you’ve planned how and when you’ll evacuate, it’s time to decide what you’ll bring. You can pack many of these items ahead of time, and it’s wise to do so to make the evacuation process as seamless as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png?width=940&name=FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Prepare yourself to bring the following if you evacuate for a hurricane:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A photo ID</li>\n<li>Medical essentials (medicine, glasses, equipment, etc.)</li>\n<li>A flashlight and extra batteries</li>\n<li>A battery-operated portable radio</li>\n<li>Bottled water</li>\n<li>Non-perishable foods</li>\n<li>Spare clothing and shoes</li>\n<li>Blankets</li>\n<li>Toiletries</li>\n<li>Important papers (<a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>, will, deed to your house, etc.)</li>\n<li>Contact information for loved ones, your doctor, and your insurance agent</li>\n<li>Cash and credit cards</li>\n<li>Extra gas for your car</li>\n<li>A first-aid kit</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">inventory of your belongings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3purchasehurricanesupplies\">3. Purchase hurricane supplies</h3>\n<p>Florida residents can prepare for a hurricane by purchasing without sales tax during the first week of hurricane season. (Learn about the <a href=\"https://floridarevenue.com/DisasterPrep/pages/default.aspx\">Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday</a>.) Most of the supplies you need will last at least a year, but it’s important to check on them to make sure you’re well equipped.</p>\n<p>These are the most important things to have stocked to prepare for hurricane season:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough water and canned food to last at least a week</li>\n<li>Flashlights or headlamps with a supply of extra batteries</li>\n<li>Candles and matches</li>\n<li>A whole-home generator</li>\n<li>Spare gasoline for your vehicles, generator, and any hand tools you might need for clearing fallen branches</li>\n<li>An ax in the attic in case there’s severe flooding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FEMA also offers some excellent <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit\">recommendations for building an emergency kit</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a generator and need to use it, don’t forget to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always operate the generator outdoors and away from open windows and doors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning or death.</li>\n<li>Always follow manufacturer's directions.</li>\n<li>Never try to power the house wiring by plugging the generator into a wall outlet, which runs the risk of electrocution.</li>\n<li>Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling to prevent ignition.</li>\n<li>Plug appliances directly into the generator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4reviewyourhomeinsurance\">4. Review your home insurance</h3>\n<p>At the start of hurricane season, read over your insurance policy to know what it covers and what it doesn't. Keep in mind that once a storm has been deemed a threat to anywhere in your state, you may not be able to make changes to your policy.</p>\n<p>Remember that homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover flood damage. You need to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for that protection.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that your <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> will apply for damage from hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>We mentioned above that you should have a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> of your belongings when you evacuate. This is mostly for insurance purposes: in the event of a disaster, pictures of your home and belongings can be vital for making insurance claims so you can replace your stuff and repair your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5getyourhomeready\">5. Get your home ready</h3>\n<p>Brace your home for potential impact. You may want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Secure soffits.</strong> Install stainless steel screws through fascia to the soffit. Apply sealant over the screws and let it set for 72 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain your roof.</strong> Secure loose shingles, make sure they're properly sealed, and install flashing around your chimney and skylights. Wind speeds of Category 1 hurricanes range from 74 to 95 miles per hour, which can easily rip off poorly attached roof shingles. Category 5 hurricanes have wind speeds of 157 miles per hour or more, which can cause total roof loss. Taking care of your roof now can help you qualify for <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">wind mitigation discounts</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Install</strong> <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\"><strong>hurricane shutters</strong></a> <strong>to protect your windows from impact.</strong> Plywood should only be used as a last-minute effort because it doesn't offer as much protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a wind-rated garage door</strong> to withstand storm pressure. You can also temporarily reinforce your existing garage door with a brace.</li>\n<li><strong>Seal cracks and gaps around windows, doors, and other openings.</strong> Gaps that seem small in dry weather can be the source of lots of water and big problems during a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure anything loose in your yard and store outdoor furniture,</strong> as high winds could send it flying. Ask your neighbors to do the same.</li>\n<li><strong>Trim tree branches</strong> that hang over your house or dying trees to prevent them from falling.</li>\n<li><strong>Back up your electronics to cloud storage</strong> and unplug your devices before a storm starts to prevent damage from electrical surges and power loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Put your refrigerator on the coldest setting</strong> to prepare for power outages and to protect your perishables.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"6prepareforfloodwaters\">6. Prepare for floodwaters</h3>\n<p>Flooding is the most costly and common type of storm damage, so it’s important to take measures to reduce the potential destruction to your home and belongings, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store valuables and important documents above the ground floor in a waterproof container.</li>\n<li>Make sure your sump pump is working properly and has a backup power source (usually either from a battery or pressure from the municipal water supply). If you don’t have a sump pump, have one installed.</li>\n<li>Block doors with <a href=\"http://www.nwclimate.org/severe-weather/hurricane-preparation-guide/flood-protection/\">sandbags and plastic or urethane foam</a>. Neither method is perfect, but both can help block the main entryway water has to your house.</li>\n<li>Consider keeping an ax in the attic in case of severe flooding, but understand that axing your way out of the attic is difficult and dangerous. In addition to an ax, consider storing a red or orange flag and a pole you can raise it on, should you need to alert rescuers that you’re in need of help.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lastminutehurricaneprep\">Last minute hurricane prep</h2>\n<p>If a storm's imminently approaching and you haven't prepared in advance, make sure you secure your home immediately. You can do that by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Closing all exterior and interior doors and windows</strong>, including the garage door. Doing so can reduce wind force on the roof by up to 30 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Making sure to charge your cell phone.</strong> SMS sometimes works after a storm when other methods of communication won't.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-app-text-messages\"><strong>Downloading the free FEMA app</strong></a> to receive real-time weather alerts from the National Weather Service targeted to your county. The app also has emergency tips for each type of event and emergency shelter listings.</li>\n<li><strong>Tidying up outdoors</strong> by storing outdoor furniture, closing gates, securing fences, tying down any fixtures in the yard, and storing tools and equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Storing your insurance provider's contact information</strong> and family you might need to contact after the storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Putting hurricane shutters in place.</strong> Plywood should only be used in place of shutters as a last-minute resort when tropical weather is imminent.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcing your garage door</strong> with a brace if it's not wind-rated.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps and cracks</strong> around windows, doors, pipes, electrical boxes, and vents.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing debris from your gutters</strong> and extending downspouts away from your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Securing loose shingles on your roof</strong> with stainless steel screws and sealant.</li>\n<li><strong>Move valuables,</strong> important documents, electronics, and furnitures to the second floor.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafterahurricane\">What to do after a hurricane</h2>\n<p>Even if you prepare for a hurricane perfectly, though, the storm might still cause damage. That’s just the nature of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Once the storm itself has passed, you’ll be faced with the job of recovering and getting your life back to normal. Here’s how to do that as safely and efficiently as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t return until there’s an official all-clear</strong>. If you evacuated, wait until authorities say it’s safe to return. Coming back too soon could strain already shaky infrastructure and put you and your family in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid flood waters</strong>. Whether you sheltered in place or evacuated, avoid wading and driving through floodwaters, which can contain debris and downed power lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat and drink with caution</strong>. Avoid drinking tap water until you’ve confirmed that it’s safe. Don’t eat refrigerated foods that were warmer than 40ºF for more than two hours. Emergency resources are likely to be constrained, so do everything in your power to avoid putting yourself in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Wear protective gear when cleaning</strong>. After a flood, anything from falling branches to <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">mold</a> could cause health problems, so proceed with caution as you clean up.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact your insurance provider</strong>. If your insurance provider hasn’t already reached out to you about coverage, reach out to communicate damage and start the process of filing claims. The sooner you do this, the sooner your home will be repaired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips, check out the EPA’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\">recovering from a hurricane</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneprepshouldbeanongoingproject\">Hurricane prep should be an ongoing project</h2>\n<p>Obviously, there are a lot of variables when it comes to preparing for bad weather. The important takeaway here is that there is no single right way to prepare for a hurricane, but you do have to prepare.</p>\n<p>Maybe the easiest way to do this is to work hurricane preparation into your normal home maintenance tasks: whenever you test your smoke alarms, check the expiration dates on your hurricane food supplies and replace anything that’s gone bad.</p>\n<p>Whenever you clean the gutters, ensure your spare gas supply is adequate.</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>When hurricane preparation becomes part of your ordinary home maintenance, you’ll be better prepared to weather any storm that blows your way.</p>"

    body: "<p>In July 2019, two earthquakes in small Southern California towns caused nearly $200 million in damage.</p>\n<p>Homeowners in Argus and Trona in San Bernardino <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-earthquakes-caused-200-million-in-damage-report-says-11564006544\">experienced significant property damage</a>.</p>\n<p>While the big earthquakes make headlines, like the San Francisco or Northridge earthquakes in 1989 and 1994 respectively, it’s the smaller quakes that serve as a reminder that homeowners must be ready. After all, <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-are-we-having-so-many-earthquakes-has-naturally-occurring-earthquake-activity-been?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\">55 earthquakes</a> happen around the world every day.</p>\n<p>So it’s time to make a plan. Here’s how to prepare before, during, and after an earthquake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforearthquakesinyourneighborhood\">How to Prepare for Earthquakes in Your Neighborhood</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a> is famous for major earthquakes because it’s home to several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault. But did you know <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/news/2019/great-shakeout-45-states-territories-at-risk-for-earthquakes.html\">45 US states and territories</a> face moderate to very high risk of earthquakes?</p>\n<p>An earthquake is caused by shifting rock below the earth’s surface that leads to a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth’s top layer where we live. We don’t yet have foolproof, super early warning systems for earthquakes because we’d need seismometers everywhere – and that’s not happening anytime soon. They’re extremely expensive and must be constantly maintained.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google\">Google is building an earthquake detection system</a> in partnership with the United States Geological Survey and the California Office of Emergency Services. As of now, users can sign up with <a href=\"https://www.shakealert.org/\">ShakeAlert</a> to get alerts when earthquakes are detected.</p>\n<p>On the west coast of the United States, these alerts could provide up to tens of seconds of warning prior to shaking.</p>\n<p>That’s not a ton of time, but it’s enough to get somewhere safer – and put your earthquake safety plan into action. Here’s what to do before that day comes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeanearthquake\">What to Do Before an Earthquake</h2>\n<p>To protect yourself, your family, and your home from an earthquake, you need to know your risks, develop a safety plan, have an emergency kit, get the right insurance, and know what to do after the quake.</p>\n<p>Planning this ahead of time is critical so you’re prepared for (usually) <a href=\"https://quake.utah.edu/earthquake-information-products/earthquake-faq#:~:text=Return%20to%20Top-,How%20long%20do%20earthquakes%20last%3F,intermittently%20for%20weeks%20or%20months.\">10 to 30 seconds</a> of shaking. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1assessyourrisk\">1. Assess Your Risk</h3>\n<p>If you live anywhere in California, earthquakes are a reality – most cities and homes are near a fault line. But if you live in one of the other 44 states or territories where earthquakes can occur, get a good impression of your risk. Talk to neighbors or ask your insurance representative about the earthquake risk for your area, and check out the USGS <a href=\"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-35.03,-188.78906&extent=75.93089,-51.32813&showUSFaults=true\">Latest Earthquakes Map</a>.</p>\n<p>Using the gear icon in the top right corner, select “U.S. Faults” to see where major faults are located and where there is recent earthquake activity. You can search by the hour, day, week, or month to get an idea of the seismic activity in the area. The more activity in the area, the more you need to be prepared for an earthquake.</p>\n<p>![fault-lines](https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fault-lines.png?width=600&amp;name=fault-lines.png =600x)<em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map\"><em>USGS</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"2secureyourhome\">2. Secure Your Home</h3>\n<p>Walk around your house and identify items that might fall during the shaking. Buy earthquake putty or adhesives that secure items that might fall off bookshelves and counters. Your local hardware store should also have furniture straps that help you secure dressers and bookshelves to the wall so they are less likely to topple over. Make sure decor hanging on the walls – like mirrors and artwork – are properly secured.</p>\n<p>Check the exterior of your home, and find your utility shut off valves (gas, electric, and water). You’ll want to know where these are after an earthquake in case you need to turn utilities off for safety reasons.</p>\n<p>It’s important to familiarize yourself with how to shut them off – you may need a special wrench for your gas shutoff. Make the trip to the hardware store and make that wrench part of your earthquake kit.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to your next action item.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3createemergencykits\">3. Create Emergency Kits</h3>\n<p>Your earthquake kit, also called an emergency kit, has essential needs items you may not be able to access after a natural disaster. Experts recommend keeping a two week supply of food, water, and emergency items in an accessible location in your home.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/kit\">Ready.gov</a>, you should have a three-day kit in a backpack that you can grab if you need to evacuate. You can keep a kit at the house, in your car, and at work because you never know where you’ll be when an earthquake happens.</p>\n<p>A minimal earthquake kit for three days should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water (one gallon per person per day)</li>\n<li>Food (a three-day supply of non-perishable food)</li>\n<li>NOAA Weather Radio (battery-powered, solar, or hand crank)</li>\n<li>Flashlight</li>\n<li>First-aid kit</li>\n<li>Extra batteries</li>\n<li>Emergency whistle</li>\n<li>Dust mask (one for each person)</li>\n<li>Plastic sheeting and duct tape (to shelter in place)</li>\n<li>Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties</li>\n<li>Wrench or pliers (including utility shut off wrench)</li>\n<li>Can opener</li>\n<li>Local maps</li>\n<li>Cell phone charger</li>\n<li>Pet food and water</li>\n<li>Medication and eye glasses (extra in case you can’t get to yours)</li>\n<li>Cash (small bills and change)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make copies of your insurance policy, house deed, and identification to store in your emergency kit. Some folks recommend scanning these and keeping them on a flash drive in the kit.</p>\n<p>For a larger home kit, you may want to include a complete change of clothing for all family members, sleeping bags, blankets, mess kits, a fire extinguisher, camping stove and cookware, and simple entertainment, such as books and card games in case help takes several days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4reviewyourhomeownersinsurancepolicy\">4. Review Your Homeowners Insurance Policy</h3>\n<p>If you’re in an earthquake-prone area, talk to your insurer about earthquake coverage. A standard homeowners insurance policy doesn’t cover earthquake damage.</p>\n<p>If you’re in California, give us a call for an earthquake insurance quote.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5outlineyourpostearthquakeplan\">5. Outline Your Post-Earthquake Plan</h3>\n<p>Before the shaking ever starts, know what you will do when it stops. You need to know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How you will get home (if you aren’t home).</li>\n<li>How to shut off getting utilities (if needed).</li>\n<li>How to meet with your household.</li>\n<li>How to contact out-of-town family or friends to let them know you’re safe.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For those with kids, planning your reunification is essential. Have a meetup spot that everyone knows to go to after the shaking stops. This could be the front gate or a specific tree on the property. By having a meetup spot, you’ll be able to quickly ascertain if someone wasn’t able to get out or may be hurt in the house.</p>\n<p>Run earthquake drills so that young children get practice with finding the meetup spot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattododuringanearthquake\">What to Do During an Earthquake</h2>\n<p><strong>Drop. Cover. Hold on.</strong></p>\n<p>As soon as you feel earthquake tremors, stop what you’re doing, drop to the ground, cover your head from anything that might fall on you, and hold on to something. If you are in bed, hold onto the bed post with a pillow over your head for protection. If you are elsewhere, drop to the ground, crawl under sturdy furniture, like a wooden dining room table, and hold the leg.</p>\n<p>While crouching under doorways was a go-to recommendation a long time ago, the Red Cross warns that doorways aren’t stronger than any other part of your house.</p>\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/earthquakes/during.html\">outside when the shaking starts</a>, move away from buildings, utility wires, and gas lines. You are at greatest risk of something falling on you from a building collapsing and need to make your way to open space. Again, you’ll need to drop to the ground and stay low just to keep your balance while the earth shakes fervently.</p>\n<p>If you are in your <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-should-i-do-during-earthquake#:~:text=Move%20your%20car%20as%20far,the%20road%20at%20bridge%20approaches.\">car during an earthquake</a>, get as far away from traffic as possible. When possible, stop in an open area where power lines and structures are less likely to fall on you. Do not stop on bridges, in tunnels, or under large trees. Stop the engine and stay in the car. Keep in mind that any cracks and breaks in the pavement may affect your ability to drive away once the shaking stops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafteranearthquake\">What to Do After an Earthquake</h2>\n<p>Once the earthquake is over, it’s time to act on all that planning you’ve done. What you do will depend on where you are when the shaking occurred and how much damage there is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"atwork\">At Work</h3>\n<p>If you’re at work, grab your emergency kit and evacuate the building. Follow the instructions of emergency personnel regarding road conditions and city-wide damage. If you’re unable to go home, determine where you will shelter (perhaps at work or an emergency shelter), and hunker down.</p>\n<p>Request help if you’re injured. If you’re not injured, do what you can to help those who are. Contact family and out-of-town contacts to let them know your status and where you are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"athome\">At Home</h3>\n<p>If you’re at home, secure yourself, family, and pets first and proceed to the meetup spot. Grab the emergency kit before leaving the house.</p>\n<p>Once everyone is accounted for, assess your home’s exterior damage. If you see structural damage, like cracks in the foundation, shut off your utilities to reduce the chance of fires, water pipe breaks, or gas leaks. Don’t go back in the house if there are collapsed walls or ceilings.</p>\n<p>Next, determine where you’ll shelter – either in place or an emergency shelter. Take your emergency backpack with you if you must leave. If you’re staying put, make sure your two-week supply of food and water is easily accessible.</p>\n<p>As you can see, being in a position to care for yourself and your family after an earthquake means that you’ve prepared long before any shaking starts. Plan ahead and practice your emergency plan so that everyone in the house knows what to do.</p>"

    body: "<p>Don't panic. Get the facts on the new strain of coronavirus so you can plan to keep yourself and your family safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coronaviruspreventiontips\">Coronavirus Prevention Tips</h2>\n<p>At the time of this publication, there have been <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429\">289 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida</a>, and 7,769 cases in the US.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has claimed seven lives in Florida and 115 lives total in the United States. Testing is still in its nascent stages.</p>\n<p>To put it mildly, the entire globe is on alert. As of February 28, China, Italy, Iran, Japan, and South Korea are all on a Level 3 Travel Notice from the CDC, meaning all non-essential travel to these areas should be avoided.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when the news is churning with stories of the virus and its implications. So let’s keep it simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t panic.</li>\n<li>Stay informed.</li>\n<li>Take smart precautions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here, we’ll summarize what the virus is and advice from health professionals on what we can do to prevent spreading the virus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscoronavirus\">What Is Coronavirus?</h2>\n<p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause upper respiratory infections. While it hasn’t made headlines of this magnitude before, coronavirus itself has been around since the 1960s with several strains causing deadly respiratory illnesses since the early 2000s. If you’ve heard of SARS or MERS, you already know two types of coronavirus before this latest outbreak.</p>\n<p>This particular virus is SARS-CoV-2, a strain of coronavirus. The disease it causes is called COVID-19. Like its sibling viruses, SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and it leads to a serious respiratory infection. This current strain was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</p>\n<p>If we’ve seen similar viruses before, what’s the panic about? In short, it hasn’t been contained yet, we don’t have a vaccine, and because it’s a new virus, many people haven’t yet developed an immunity to it. Plus, it’s deadlier on average than the common flu. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html\">According to the New York Times</a>, seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1 percent of infected people, whereas a new report on COVID-19 puts its death rate at 1.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Both SARS and MERS caused similar panic, and containment happened with time. We aren’t there yet, but here’s what you need to know to stay safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethesymptomsofcoronavirus\">What Are the Symptoms of Coronavirus?</h2>\n<p>Symptoms of coronavirus are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear between two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. If you are experiencing these symptoms, whether you are known to have been exposed to the virus or not, seek medical attention immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoescoronavirusspread\">How Does Coronavirus Spread?</h2>\n<p>The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can be spread by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.</li>\n<li>Having small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.</li>\n<li>Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both SARS and MERS can live on metal, glass, or plastic for up to nine days. We are still learning about this strain of coronavirus and how long it can live on these surfaces (as well as on money).</p>\n<p>Though people are most contagious when they are the sickest, the CDC states some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. The virus is said to be community spread – meaning many infected folks in an affected area are not sure how or where they caught the illness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridaandthecoronavirus\">Florida and the Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, there are 18 positive cases in Florida at the time of this writing. The current Florida cases of COVID-19 span Santa Rosa, Hillsborough, and Manatee counties. You can stay current on the cases as they unfold via <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/\">Florida’s Department of Health</a>.</p>\n<p>The patients who have been recovering out of state had confirmed travel into China and were quarantined in other states as they returned to the US. While these are the known cases, 115 others are pending test results and 302 others are currently being monitored for coronavirus symptoms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscandotoavoidspreadingcoronavirus\">What Homeowners Can Do to Avoid Spreading Coronavirus</h2>\n<p>Again, there’s a difference between panic and <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">preparedness</a>. We advocate for the latter. These tips, summarized from the CDC, can help you and your family reduce the chance of illness and make a plan in case of an outbreak.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practicepreventativehabits\">Practice Preventative Habits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for 30 seconds – about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.</li>\n<li>Wash your hands before cooking, eating, or coming into contact with community property and utensils.</li>\n<li>Use hand sanitizer with at least a 60 percent alcohol content when you aren’t near a sink.</li>\n<li>Use disinfectants to clean surfaces you come in contact with, including your phone, tables, desks, car doors, doorknobs, and doors.</li>\n<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>\n<li>Practice social distancing to help \"flatten the curve\" – this reduces the amount of infected folks at a single time so that our healthcare facilities and resources aren't strained. If you are able to stay at home, please do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A note about cleaning products:</strong> products with ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, or bleach-based cleaners are effective at killing coronavirus found on many surfaces. Use an antibacterial detergent when washing clothes.</p>\n<p><strong>A note about hand washing versus hand sanitizer:</strong> The CDC confirms that a hand sanitizer with at least a 60 percent alcohol content is effective in killing coronavirus. The alcohol can break down the outer shell of the virus, allowing the sanitizer to kill the virus and reduce the risk of infection. However, hand sanitizer isn’t effective when your hands are dirty or greasy.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, hand washing is a better option for preventing coronavirus, a cold, or the flu. Hand sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs. As a general rule, the CDC says to use soap and water when available for the best results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"makeaplanforyourhousehold\">Make a Plan for Your Household</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk with your family members about what to do if COVID-19 impacts your community.</li>\n<li>Consult with your healthcare providers if you or your family members are at higher risk of health complications from COVID-19. The CDC states older people and immunocompromised folks are most at risk.</li>\n<li>Make a list of organizations you can turn to for aid, information, and healthcare services in your community.</li>\n<li>Create an emergency contact list and make sure your family members have a copy.</li>\n<li>Choose a room in your home that can be used for family members who are sick so that infection doesn’t spread.</li>\n<li>Be prepared for changes in your routine when coronavirus impacts your community. Ask your employer about the ability to <a href=\"/blog/work-from-home-tips/\">work remotely</a> (if possible), and get in touch with schools to learn their plan for continuing education during a quarantine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To stay up to date on the virus, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\">check the CDC website</a> often.</p>"

    body: "<p>Hurricane season is the time to be vigilant. Even passing storms can cause significant flooding, and even an inch of water in the home can cause extensive and expensive water damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreventmoldafterwaterdamage\">How to prevent mold after water damage</h2>\n<p>Any amount of water left unattended can cause mold in the house, and <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered/\">mold</a> can cause a lot of health-related problems, like allergies, asthma, and lung irritation. Mold can spread once water starts evaporating into the air, especially in humid or rainy conditions. That’s why it’s so important to immediately clean water damaged areas.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should work with a <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> restoration company after a flood that can help dry out your home and prevent mold from spreading. The <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Kin Managed Repair Network</a> connects you with these professionals automatically if you have a covered water damage claim.</p>\n<p>But there’s work you can do to mitigate damage and prevent mold on your own, too. These tips can help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1cleananddrythefloodedareasrightaway\">1. Clean and dry the flooded areas right away</h2>\n<p>Time is of the essence when it comes to water damage. The longer water sits, the harder it is to repair. Make a plan to start <a href=\"/blog/prevent-unexpected-cleaning-expenses/\">cleaning</a> within 48 hours of the flooding (if you can safely do so).</p>\n<p>Before you embark on cleaning and drying everything, make sure that you have the right safety equipment to do so. Here are some safety tips when dealing with flood damage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wear an N-95 safety mask to toxic particles at bay.</li>\n<li>Put goggles on to protect your eyes from dirty water.</li>\n<li>Wear gloves and rubber boots to protect your skin.</li>\n<li>Make sure that you only enter the area when you know it’s safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As soon as the storm stops, go through the house and check every room for water, spills, and leaks. Once you’ve identified the flooded areas, start cleaning and drying them up. Remove water with a wet and dry vacuum cleaner. If you don’t have one, you can rent one.</p>\n<p>You can also hire a mold removal service company to help you, particularly if the area is big (i.e., a garage or basement).</p>\n<p>If you have wet floor carpets or rugs, dry them first using the vacuum cleaner and then use a fan to complete the drying process. Keep the fan on for 24 hours or more. You can also steam-clean your carpet once it’s dry.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2checkyourhomesexterior\">2. Check your home’s exterior</h2>\n<p>Check the outside of your home, too. If you see pooling water near the foundation, that can cause cracks and other damage, including mold growth. To prevent pool water, you might need to fix your grade, extend your downspouts, or add a <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-install-a-french-drain/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9012cc2665\">French drain</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3dehumidifythehousewatchthehumiditylevels\">3. Dehumidify the house &amp; watch the humidity levels</h2>\n<p>Right after a storm or flood, moisture in the air can lead to mold growth. Getting the house as dry as possible is key to keeping mold at bay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open all the windows in your home.</li>\n<li>Turn on all fans.</li>\n<li>Use a dehumidifying machine to keep the air dry, clean, and cool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use a humidity monitor to keep an eye on humidity levels. The ideal level is below 60 percent in the summertime, while 25 to 40 percent is normal for winter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4sanitizeeverything\">4. Sanitize everything</h2>\n<p>All water damaged areas, furniture, and things should be completely sanitized after cleaning. For your sofa, beds, and other furniture, use a steam cleaner or a wet and dry vacuum cleaner. For surfaces like floors and walls, use soap and water to clean and sanitize them using a water-chlorine bleach solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5throwawaywhatcantbecleanedafteryourclaimisapproved\">5. Throw away what can’t be cleaned (after your claim is approved)</h2>\n<p>Some materials can’t be thoroughly cleaned and dried. Others, like electronics, might be beyond repair if they’re waterlogged. Before throwing away these items, make sure they are accounted for in your insurance claim. Your claims professional will need documentation of all damage to your belongings to <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">approve your claim</a>.</p>\n<p>Keep paying attention to your home and surroundings even after you’ve done all these steps, especially throughout <a href=\"/blog/new-flood-season/\">flood season</a> and <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a>. If you smell something musty, err on the side of caution and start cleaning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequentlyaskedquestionsforpreventingmoldafteraflood\">Frequently asked questions for preventing mold after a flood</h2>\n<h3 id=\"howsoondoesmoldgrowafteraflood\">How soon does mold grow after a flood?</h3>\n<p>Mold and mildew can start to form within 24 to 48 hours of exposure to water. Worse? It continues to grow until you take the necessary steps to remediate it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatkillsmoldafteraflood\">What kills mold after a flood?</h3>\n<p>According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), you can <a href=\"https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2016/11/cleaning-mold-after-a-flood/\">kill mold using bleach</a>. However, the CDC emphasizes that you should only use one cup of bleach per gallon of water. Remember to also wear goggles, gloves, and an N-95 mask when working with bleach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongshouldirunadehumidifierafteraflood\">How long should I run a dehumidifier after a flood?</h3>\n<p>You may need to run a dehumidifier anywhere from two days to several weeks. The amount of time required depends on how bad your flooding was, how big of an area was flooded, and what materials were soaked.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whenshouldihireaprofessionalmoldremediationcompany\">When should I hire a professional mold remediation company?</h3>\n<p>In truth, a professional mold remediation company is usually a good idea. It’s safer than tackling the project yourself, and a professional team is likely to be more successful. That said, the Environmental Protection Agency says homeowners may be able to handle mold clean up if the affected area is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-cleanup-your-home\">less than 10 square feet</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n<p><em>Rachel Anderson is the content marketing strategist of</em> <a href=\"https://azfirewater.com/\">Arizona Fire & Water Restoration, Inc.</a><em>, a Phoenix-based company that provides water, fire, and smoke damage restoration as well as mold remediation and removal services.

    body: "<p>Energy costs are on the rise, and with winter around the corner, now’s a good time to figure out what small changes you can make to keep that energy bill in check.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreduceenergybills\">How to Reduce Energy Bills</h2>\n<p>The average <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/electricity.php#:~:text=EIA%20forecasts%20the%20U.S.%20retail,average%20retail%20price%20in%202019.&text=Forecast%20residential%20prices%20rise%20by%20an%20additional%201.2%25%20in%202021.\">retail electricity price</a> in the US is 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, a 1.2 percent increase from 2019. We’ll likely see costs go up by 1.2 percent again in 2021, too.</p>\n<p>Aside from saving you some green, conserving energy is good for the environment. The EPA notes 40 percent of the energy consumed in the US is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/learn-about-energy-and-its-impact-environment\">used to generate electricity</a>, and most electricity is generated using fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. In other words, our energy consumption is a big part of our environmental footprint and impacts our air, water, and land.</p>\n<p>Feeling inspired? These 12 tips will help you keep energy bills down and reduce energy waste.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1useenergyefficientappliances\">1. Use Energy-Efficient Appliances</h3>\n<p>If you’re in the market for new appliances, look for the Energy Star logo. Yes, there are energy-efficient versions of everything now: refrigerators, washers, dryers, microwaves, and dishwashers. They do the same job but require less energy to do it.</p>\n<p>Energy-efficient appliances could help you save up to <a href=\"https://blog.directenergy.com/save-money-energy-star-appliances/\">$100 a year</a> on your energy bill. Plus, your state and local utility companies may offer rebates for these appliances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2shinelongerwithledbulbs\">2. Shine Longer with LED Bulbs</h3>\n<p>Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs are pretty price competitive with incandescent bulbs, but they last longer and use far less energy. An LED bulb <a href=\"https://blog.arcadia.com/led-vs-regular-lightbulbs-do-they-really-make-a-difference\">only uses 11 to 12 watts</a>; an incandescent bulb uses anywhere from 50 to 120 watts. That’s a 75 percent energy reduction to light your home.</p>\n<p>LED bulbs also last eight to 25 times longer than an incandescent or halogen bulb. Each LED bulb has more than 50,000 hours of use time – about 11 years of lighting your home for 12 hours a day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3installasolarwaterheater\">3. Install a Solar Water Heater</h3>\n<p>Your water heater is one of the most energy-consuming appliances in the home. On average, it runs three hours a day and costs nearly $781 a year. Traditional 50-gallon water heaters run at 5,500 watts. A <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-does-solar-water-heater-cost.htm\">solar water heater costs $3,500 on average</a>, but the savings add up over time. Your return on investment is about five years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4switchtoasmartthermostat\">4. Switch to a Smart Thermostat</h3>\n<p>You can control a smart thermostat on your phone, tablet, or internet-connected device, which means you can adjust the settings when you wake in the morning or return home from work. That way you’re not paying for extra heating and cooling while you’re away. Some smart home thermostats could reduce heating and cooling costs <a href=\"https://www.alarmnewengland.com/blog/smart-thermostat-energy-bill-savings\">by 15 percent,</a> or about $130 each year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5turndowntheheat\">5. Turn Down the Heat</h3>\n<p>Keeping your home just a few degrees warmer or cooler can dramatically reduce your annual energy consumption and bill. For every degree that you set your thermostat back during the winter, you can save 1% on your energy bill. During the winter months, this means wearing an extra layer while in the house or putting an extra blanket on your bed to save up to 10% on your energy bill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6brightenupwithsolarpanels\">6. Brighten Up with Solar Panels</h3>\n<p>The cost to install a <a href=\"https://www.solarreviews.com/solar-panels/solar-panel-cost/\">6kW solar panel system</a> varies depending on where you live. Installation can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $19,080, but some state and city utility companies offer rebate programs. Plus, you qualify for a federal tax credit – <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/solar-panels/how-to-get-a-solar-tax-credit/\">26 percent of the cost of the system and installation in 2020</a> (and 22 percent in 2021). Once you have a solar panel, you could completely eliminate your monthly utility bill. In some cases, you can tie your system into the utility company’s infrastructure and <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/mortgage/sell-electricity-back-grid\">sell energy back to the grid</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7fixleakyfaucets\">7. Fix Leaky Faucets</h3>\n<p>Check your home for dripping faucets, running toilets, or leaks under sinks. Even a small leak can drive up your water and electricity expenses (if it’s leaking hot water). A <a href=\"https://www.erplumbing.com/blog/how-much-does-a-dripping-faucet-cost-per-month-in-water-bills/\">leaking faucet can cost you $20 a month</a>, and a running toilet can use 200 gallons of water per day and cost $75 to $150 a month. Fix those leaks to save on utility bills.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance guide</a> for more tips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8plantsometrees\">8. Plant Some Trees</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://treescharlotte.org/tree-tips/trees-save-energy\">Trees can reduce energy costs</a> both in the summer and winter. During summer months, shade from the trees keeps your home from getting too hot. During winter, the trees provide a windbreak, slowing the winter winds from directly hitting your house and cooling your walls. That can save you 10 to 50 percent in heating. Learn more about <a href=\"/referral/\">how planting trees does a world of good</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9getaceilingfan\">9. Get a Ceiling Fan</h3>\n<p>A ceiling fan can help keep your home cool during summer months and warmer during winter. In the summer, make sure the blades rotate in a <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/ceiling-fan-direction-in-summer-and-winter/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9036ab25bf\">counterclockwise direction to push down the cool air</a> so your AC works less hard. Reverse the fan’s rotation in the winter (and keep it on the lowest speed) to draw cold air up toward the ceiling. On average, ceiling fans can help consumers <a href=\"https://ygrene.com/blog/energy-saving-ceiling-fans-fact-or-fiction\">save up to 8 percent on cooling costs</a>. The cost to install a ceiling fan is <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/heating-and-cooling/install-a-ceiling-fan/\">$247 on average</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10maintainyourhvacsystem\">10. Maintain Your HVAC System</h3>\n<p>Change the air filter in your HVAC unit to save on energy costs. A dirty air filter makes the system work harder to push air through the system and cool it. It can reduce the HVAC unit’s energy consumption by 15 percent. For many homeowners, that could help you <a href=\"https://ushomefilter.com/clean-air-filters-save-money/\">save 7.5 percent in energy costs</a> each month for a $12 air filter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11powerthingsdown\">11. Power Things Down</h3>\n<p>Even when your electronic devices aren’t in use, so long as they’re plugged in, they’re drawing energy. When possible, unplug devices and turn off power strips to save a few dollars on utility costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12cookwithanairfryerorsmallerappliances\">12. Cook with an Air Fryer (or Smaller Appliances)</h3>\n<p>Did you know your oven uses <a href=\"http://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_oven.htm\">2,400 watts per hour</a> on average? At 13 cents per kilowatt, that’s $9.49 a month or $113.89 a year to use your oven once a day for an hour. That might not seem like much, but with all your other appliances, it can add up. When it makes sense, try to use smaller appliances to get the job done. For example, the average air fryer uses between 800 and 1,500 watts. This could reduce your energy consumption by as much as two-thirds.</p>\n<p>Remember, these are just ideas to get you started on a path toward less energy consumption. The goal isn’t to live a spartan, joyless life. It’s to take stock of where you can reduce your use and make those adjustments when you’re able to.</p>"

    body: "<p>Louisiana is <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">one of the most expensive states for home insurance</a> because of its risk of flooding and hurricanes. In fact, the 2020 hurricane season proved especially rocky for the Bayou State as five hurricanes made landfall last year, breaking the state's record for <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/hurricane/article_d17ea1e2-2e5b-11eb-bcf4-f70bcbd968ee.html\">most hurricanes in a single season</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words: your home insurance needs to be up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>These tips can help you shop for <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">home insurance in Louisiana</a>, find a policy that fits your budget, and get peace of mind as <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> approaches. Let's get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1determineyourhomeownersinsuranceneeds\">1. Determine Your Homeowners Insurance Needs</h2>\n<p>Every <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy provides basic coverage that protects different parts of the home, such as your dwelling, personal belongings, and any additional structures. It can also cover costs if you face a lawsuit, have to temporarily relocate, or if a guest has an injury. While the coverages are standard, you get to decide how much you need of each.</p>\n<p>Basically, you’re trying to identify where your greatest risks are. For instance, let’s say you have a lot of stereo equipment and high-end electronics in your home. That may mean you want to take a good hard look at how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> you can afford. Or maybe you have a trampoline or a swimming pool that increases the risk of someone getting hurt on your property. In that case, you might want more <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Both these examples focus on increasing coverage to avoid being underinsured, but remember the reverse is true, too. Once you know where your risks are, you can pick the appropriate amount of coverage without being over insured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2haveyourpreviouspolicyhandy\">2. Have Your Previous Policy Handy</h2>\n<p>If you're shopping for home insurance to replace an existing policy, don’t shop without that policy in hand. You won’t know if a new policy is better or worse than your old one unless you compare them. Certain details can have a big impact on a policy’s cost and coverage, so be sure to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limits:</strong> Check that both premiums are based on similar coverage limits; otherwise, you may think you’re getting an incredible deal only to find out you actually have less coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Deductibles:</strong> Increasing your deductible, or the amount you owe in a claim, usually lowers your premium.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal belonging sub-limits:</strong> Insurers place sub-limits on certain valuables, so that they only have to pay a certain amount for them in a claim. These sub-limits can vary between insurers, so you want to know if you’re comparing policies with similar caps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you’re comparing apples-to-apples rather than just assuming a cheaper policy is the better deal. A closer look might show that the cheaper policy has less coverage across the board, leaving you exposed to big out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3getyourinformationready\">3. Get Your Information Ready</h2>\n<p>To get a quote with Kin, you need your home’s address and a couple details about your property. You may also need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>, depending on your home's age.</li>\n<li>A security certificate to get a smart home security discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As long as you’re gathering this information, you might as well review it, too. Make note of any issues with your home mentioned in inspection reports that may indicate you need additional coverage. For instance, old plumbing may mean you need coverage for sewer backup. It protects you if your plumbing backs up and causes damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4knowwhatyourpersonalbelongingsareworth\">4. Know What Your Personal Belongings Are Worth</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies offer property coverage based on a percentage of your dwelling coverage – usually from 20 to 50 percent. So if your home’s replacement cost is $200,000, your belongings may be covered for $20,000 to $100,000, depending on the default percentage you choose.</p>\n<p>This default coverage may or may not be enough for you. The best way to know is to do a rough inventory of your stuff. This includes appliances, electronics, furnishings, and wardrobe. While you don’t need a line-by-line inventory, the more detailed you are, the closer you can get to properly covering your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">how much homeowners insurance you may need</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5investigateyourfloodrisk\">5. Investigate Your Flood Risk</h2>\n<p>Many parts of Louisiana sit below sea level and are prone to flooding. Standard homeowners insurance policies don’t cover floods, so you usually need to take the extra step to address this big risk. You can use <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">FEMA’s map center</a> to get a better idea of your flood risk.</p>\n<p>Many insurance carriers rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to offer flood coverage, but the coverage it provides is limited. Kin, on the other hand, can offer a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance endorsement</a> that is not only comprehensive but costs as little as $175 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6learnabouthurricanedeductibles\">6. Learn about Hurricane Deductibles</h2>\n<p>Home insurance policies in Louisiana include a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>. This is a separate deductible from your \"All Other Perils (AOP)\" deductible. It only applies when your home experiences wind damage during a named storm.</p>\n<p>Hurricane deductibles in Louisiana typically run between two and five percent of the amount your home is insured for. So if your home is insured for $200,000 with a five percent hurricane deductible, you’d be responsible for $10,000 worth of any wind damage in a claim triggered by a named storm. But if your policy only requires a two percent deductible, your out-of-pocket costs go down to $4,000.</p>\n<p>Before you jump at the policy with the lower hurricane deductible, remember selecting the higher percentage usually reduces your premium. Ultimately, you have to weigh how much you can afford if your home is damaged in a hurricane against paying a higher premium for your homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>You should also note that a <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2020/10/08/585935.htm\">Louisiana state law</a> prohibits homeowners from paying more than one hurricane deductible in a single hurricane season. With <a href=\"/blog/louisiana-hurricane-history/\">major named storms becoming more frequent</a>, this tidbit may come in handy if you’re on the coast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7askaboutdiscounts\">7. Ask about Discounts</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies often reward homeowners for behaviors that make their homes more attractive to insure. In Louisiana, you may get discounts if your house has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">hip-shaped roof</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">Wind mitigation features</a>, like impact-resistant covers on your glass openings.</li>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Water leak detection and mitigation devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some also have discounts if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are a new homebuyer.</li>\n<li>Live in a secured community.</li>\n<li>Haven’t filed claims.</li>\n<li>Opt for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to help you save as much money as possible and can find every discounts you're eligible for.

    body: "<p>Dealing with the aftermath of a major storm can be stressful. You’ve got cleaning up to do and insurance forms to fill out. Now imagine what could happen if you fell victim to contractor fraud. Not only would you still have the hassle of getting your home repaired, but you’d have the extra trouble of being overcharged for shoddy work and unnecessary repairs.</p>\n<p>Contractor fraud costs insurance companies a lot of money. In fact, the National Insurance Crime Bureau says property and casualty insurance companies paid up to $9.2 billion more in disaster claims due to insurance fraud in 2021. But ultimately, this cost ends up getting passed on to <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insureds</a> like you in the form of higher premiums. This is one of the reasons <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida homeowners rates are increasing</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscontractorfraud\">What Is Contractor Fraud?</h2>\n<p>Contractor fraud is when an individual contractor or a contracting firm purposely deceives another party over services. Some examples of contractor fraud include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking for an upfront payment and never completing the work.</li>\n<li>Making unnecessary repairs.</li>\n<li>Inventing problems that cost extra to fix.</li>\n<li>Charging for repairs they don’t make.</li>\n<li>Passing off used materials as new.</li>\n<li>Overcharging for services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One type of contractor fraud that has been impacting <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida home insurance</a> centers on <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignment of benefits</a> (AOB). It’s not uncommon for contractors to ask homeowners to sign an AOB that gives the contractor control of the homeowner’s <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>. Unfortunately, some fraudulent contractors inflate their costs and bill the <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> after they have the AOB in hand. Fraudulent contractors may even sue the insurer on your behalf when it refuses to pay the padded bill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fraudulentcontractorsredflagsforhomeowners\">Fraudulent Contractors: Red Flags for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>Nobody wants to be the victim of an <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">assignment of benefits scam</a>, or any type of contractor fraud for that matter. To help you avoid schemes, we’ve compiled a list of red flags for homeowners.</p>\n<p>Beware of contractors that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Approach you about damage you didn’t know you had.</strong> If a contractor claims you have damage, make sure they show you evidence.</li>\n<li><strong>Promise free repairs.</strong> A contractor might swear that you can get a free roof through your insurance company.</li>\n<li><strong>Begins repairs before your insurer inspects your damages.</strong> While you do want to mitigate your damages, you have to remember that <a href=\"/faq/insurance-loss-inspection/\">loss inspections</a> are a typical part of any claims filing.</li>\n<li><strong>Seem unprofessional.</strong> You want to be wary of any contractor who has contracts with typos and grammatical errors, who can’t provide basic business information, or who won’t show you their business insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Require full payment in advance.</strong> A contractor may ask for some money upfront to cover materials, but 10 percent of the total estimate is the norm. Asking for 50 percent or more is a sign that something is amiss..</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t pay suppliers.</strong> At least some of your down payment should go towards labor and materials. Contractors who don’t pay the suppliers may be taking that as profit for themselves, leaving you to deal with the supplier on your own.</li>\n<li><strong>Are from another state.</strong> Contractors sometimes flock to disaster areas looking for work. However, working with out-of-state contractors is risky because they may not be licensed in your state.</li>\n<li><strong>Continually find new problems.</strong> It isn’t uncommon for a contractor to find another issue when they open up walls and get behind cabinets, but finding several problems may be a red flag. If possible, get a second opinion to make sure it really is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</li>\n<li><strong>Say they don’t need permits.</strong> Permits exist to protect you and make sure that the work meets building codes and city ordinances. Legitimate contractors will always pull a permit for major work.</li>\n<li><strong>Requires cash.</strong> Reputable contractors are usually prepared to take checks or credit cards. If a contractor says they’re a cash-only business, then demand a receipt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These signs indicate that something is wrong with your contractor, but they’re not the only red flags. In general, you want to trust your gut.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyoususpectcontractorfraud\">What To Do If You Suspect Contractor Fraud</h2>\n<p>Your first step if you suspect that a contractor is trying to scam you is to start documenting your concerns. Record the work that’s been completed and hold on to any paperwork between the two of you, such as contracts, receipts, and canceled checks. Then talk to your contractor about your concerns. Your contractor may have legitimate reasons for delays and is willing to work with you to make sure your repairs are completed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you may have to contact the Better Business Bureau or the state contractor licensing authority.</p>"

    body: "<p>Many of us are still spending extra time at home and looking for creative outlets and <a href=\"/blog/easy-home-projects/\">home improvement projects</a> to keep busy. Few hobbies combine these two things better than learning how to start a vegetable garden from scratch.</p>\n<p>Not only does planting a vegetable garden get you up and moving in the fresh air, but the vegetables you produce can offset today’s soaring food costs. If you’re new to gardening, start small and plan well so you can have vegetables you grew yourself on your dinner table this summer.</p>\n<p>And don't worry – you don't need a green thumb to have a thriving vegetable garden. These are tips anyone can put into action, regardless of your gardening experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosetherightspot\">Choose the Right Spot</h2>\n<p>You don’t need a lot of space for an abundant garden. In fact, most experts recommend a space that’s no bigger than 10’ x 10’ when you first start out to keep your garden manageable. Depending on your yard, you may want to start even smaller, especially as you think about how much sun and water you need.</p>\n<p>Vegetables typically need at least six hours of direct sunlight every day, so you want to choose a spot that's fairly exposed. However, if you live in an area where the summer sun will beat down on your plants, look for an area that gets some afternoon shade. This will give your plants relief for part of the day.</p>\n<p>Check the soil and make sure the area has good drainage. If your soil has lots of sand or clay, you can mix in organic matter to improve it. You need about two to three inches of organic matter for clay soil and an extra inch to sandy soil. Compost or well-rotted manure are the best for soil health. Adding organic material also helps the soil texture to better absorb the water your seed needs while still allowing it to drain at the right speed.</p>\n<p>If you don't opt for a raised garden bed, you may want to surround your vegetable garden with a border – perhaps decorative edging or flowers. This not only makes it easy to see where you need to tend, but it can help keep pets (and pests!) out.</p>\n<p>One important note regarding gardens and your home’s value: most people know that complimentary landscaping goes a long way toward <a href=\"/blog/home-and-garden-curb-appeal/\">increasing your home’s curb appeal</a>. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean a veggie garden will have the same effect. Not everyone wants to do the work a garden requires, so consider using raised beds if you’re thinking about moving in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stockuponsuppliesandtools\">Stock Up on Supplies and Tools</h2>\n<p>Having the right tools and supplies make starting a vegetable garden much easier. Here are some must-haves to put on your list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water hose</li>\n<li>Spray nozzle</li>\n<li>Garden gloves</li>\n<li>Trowel</li>\n<li>Garden forks</li>\n<li>Garden stakes</li>\n<li>Dandelion weeder</li>\n<li>Fruit and vegetable fertilizer</li>\n<li>Fruit and vegetable disease control</li>\n<li>Insect control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also need other things based on your location and the vegetables you plant. For example, gardens where there’s more wildlife benefit from protective fencing, and tall plants like tomatoes require a trellis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pickyourvegetables\">Pick Your Vegetables</h2>\n<p>Now for the fun part: pick the vegetables you want to grow. If you’ve decided to go with a 100 square foot garden (that’s the 10’ by 10’ one we mentioned earlier), then you want three to five types of vegetables and three to five plants of each type.</p>\n<p>As a beginner, you want to choose vegetables that are easy to grow and that you and your family enjoy eating. Here are some popular low-maintenance options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tomatoes</li>\n<li>Peppers</li>\n<li>Squash</li>\n<li>Carrots</li>\n<li>Radishes</li>\n<li>Corn</li>\n<li>Lettuce</li>\n<li>Greens</li>\n<li>Peas</li>\n<li>Broccoli</li>\n<li>Eggplant</li>\n<li>Potatoes</li>\n<li>Kale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and squash only need to be planted once to continuously produce fruits and vegetables. Others, like carrots, radishes, and corn, need to be replanted after a harvest.</p>\n<p>Timing is important, too. Lettuce, greens, peas, and radishes are great to plant in early spring because they do better in the cooler weather of the season. When the weather warms up, you can add tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and herbs. Vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, and kale are best timed for fall harvests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plantyourvegetablegarden\">Plant Your Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>You can plant your garden using seeds or plants at various stages of growth purchased at your local garden store. Seeds are usually more expensive and take longer to produce crops compared to starter plants. However, starter plants can be easier for new gardeners to grow because you can plant them when there’s no more danger of frost in your area.</p>\n<p>Whether you go with seeds or starter plants, the actual steps to planting a vegetable garden are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a trowel to dig a hole two times deeper and wider than your plant:</strong> This gives your plants enough space for their roots to take hold and for their leaves to get plenty of sunlight and air circulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Place plants in holes and cover them with soil:</strong> Compact the soil around them, and be sure to not bury them deeper than what they were in their containers. You should also add garden stakes to vine plants such as tomatoes and beans so that they can grow vertically.</li>\n<li><strong>Water your seeds or new plants immediately after planting:</strong> Plants and seeds need water right away to help them settle in, but you also want to water them whenever the soil is starting to dry out approximately a half inch from the top.</li>\n<li><strong>Fertilize your plants:</strong> A new location can be stressful on fledgling plants, so give them some TLC in the form of extra nutrients. Vegetable fertilizer can build stronger root systems, stalks, and leaves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"maintainyourgarden\">Maintain Your Garden</h2>\n<p>One thing veteran gardeners will tell you when you’re learning how to start a vegetable garden is how important it is to care for your plants. A well-tended 10’ by 10’ vegetable garden will yield more produce than an untended 10’ by 25’ garden, so make gardening part of your routine.</p>\n<p>Your first concern should be water. The soil should be moist, and that means that you need to water your vegetables every couple of days – and probably every day during really hot summers. The best time to water is in the late afternoon or early evening when plants can spend the night recovering from the day’s stresses.</p>\n<p>If you’re worried that you’ll forget to water your plants or your best source for water is a bit of a haul, consider a drip irrigation system or a soaker hose to keep everything hydrated. You can even get a timer that turns these on and off so you don’t overwater your plants.</p>\n<p>Next, make sure you keep weeds out of your vegetable garden. You don’t want to let the weeds take over and choke out your plants. It's best to tackle weeds when they’re small and easily pulled out by the root, so check for them regularly. To get the stubborn weeds with deep roots, you can use a dandelion weeder. This allows you to get directly under the weed and pop it out from the roots.</p>\n<p>Finally, fertilize your vegetable garden regularly. Most experts agree that you should add fertilizer to the soil every three to four weeks. That’s true even when crops start to appear so that your plants continue to get the nourishment they need to grow and produce vegetables.</p>\n<p>We’d love to end this with a happy, “And that’s all there is to it!” But learning how to start a vegetable garden and tending to it throughout the growing season requires consistent attention. Just remember that your efforts will be rewarded with healthy fresh food for you and your family.</p>"

    body: "<p>Is your home brimming with dangerous chemicals? Probably not. But this guide can help you figure out the toxic items that should be stored with care.</p>\n<p>Hearing about toxins in the home is enough to make any homeowner nervous – especially if you just bought your house or you’re planning to stay there for the long haul. But the reality is that some substances commonly found in American households can have a negative impact on your health or wellbeing – not to mention that of the planet.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll offer some insight into products and substances that might contain toxic chemicals or that have been linked to negative side effects. We’ll also offer alternatives that are easy to find, effective, and inexpensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backgroundavoidingtoxindoomgloom\">Background: Avoiding Toxin Doom &amp; Gloom</h2>\n<p>Before we dig in, here’s a disclaimer: there’s a lot of pseudoscience out there about “toxins” and “chemicals.” For the purposes of this guide, we’re proceeding with the following assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Everything is made up of chemicals, and not all chemicals are harmful! (E.g., the chemical composition of water is hydrogen and oxygen.)</li>\n<li>Most household products sold commercially are mostly safe, thanks to the many safety regulations they have to adhere to.</li>\n<li>Despite the above, some substances can have harmful effects on people or animals even if they’re used properly. These effects are often either discovered by new research that wasn’t available when a product was approved or only happen to a small portion of the population.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, nothing in this guide is intended to be diagnostic. It’s merely informational. If you have any concerns about a health condition, you should consult your physician. If someone in your home has ingested a substance you think is toxic, <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/\">contact poison control</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everything is made up of chemicals, and not all chemicals are harmful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part1householdtoxinsinplainsightandalternatives\">Part 1: Household Toxins in Plain Sight (and Alternatives)</h2>\n<p>In this section, we’ll highlight common household substances that are harmful if used improperly. These are substances that you may not be able to get around using in your daily life but that you want to keep away from children and pets, who might try to eat them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allpurposecleanersotherhouseholdcleaners\">All-purpose cleaners &amp; other household cleaners</h3>\n<p>Some of the heavy-duty all-purpose cleaners out there can irritate your skin and your respiratory system and can be toxic if swallowed. Even “specialized” cleaners (for toilets, mirrors, mold, ovens, carpet / upholstery, drains, and furniture) often have ingredients that irritate our systems. Common dangerous ingredients include ammonia, ethylene glycol, monobutyl acetate, sodium hypochlorite, and trisodium phosphate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Wear latex gloves when using these cleaners, and open windows and doors to improve airflow. Never mix two cleaners (ammonia and bleach create a poisonous gas when combined).</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: You can clean most stuff in your home with some combination of baking soda, vinegar, lemons, and hydrogen peroxide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"antifreeze\">Antifreeze</h3>\n<p>Fumes from ethylene glycol-based antifreeze can make you dizzy. Ingesting it can be deadly. This substance has a sweet smell, so pets might be attracted to it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Store in a sealed container out of reach of children and pets. Clean up spills quickly, and wear gloves to do so, because it’s possible to absorb it through your skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: Propylene glycol-based antifreeze.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"batteries\">Batteries</h3>\n<p>Wet-cell batteries (like those in car engines) contain sulfuric acid and lead. They’re sealed, but if the seal is broken, fumes from the acid can cause irritation, and the acid itself can cause skin damage and even blindness (if it gets in your eyes).</p>\n<p><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Clean the area if a battery’s seal is broken. Wash your hands immediately after. Keep kids and pets away from all batteries (especially those they can swallow).</p>\n<h3 id=\"bleach\">Bleach</h3>\n<p>Aka <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=928&tid=192\">sodium hypochlorite</a>. This stuff can irritate skin and breathing passages and can be deadly if ingested. If it’s <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool</a>-strength bleach, the concentration is higher than what you’d use for household cleaning, so be aware that it’s more potent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Wear latex gloves while handling and wash skin immediately if contact occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Plenty (for household cleaning)! Hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice – it depends on what you’d use the bleach for. Jump down to “Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic” for more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insecticides\">Insecticides</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re spraying yourself, de-bugging your home, or treating your <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pets</a> for fleas or ticks, insect killers can cause problems to more than just our six- (or eight-) legged friends (foes?).</p>\n<p><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Broadly, follow instructions on the container. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid petting your dogs or cats for 24 hours after applying tick and flea treatments (or, more realistically, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after petting).</li>\n<li>If you’re using a “bug bomb” indoors, seal off the area being treated and get all people and pets outside the house during the treatment. After, clean every surface food might touch (tables, plates, cups, etc.) and get some air circulating.</li>\n<li>If possible, spray your clothes with insecticide rather than your skin. Shower as soon as you can when you get indoors.</li>\n<li>Avoid spraying insecticides near food.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"laundrydishdetergent\">Laundry &amp; dish detergent</h3>\n<p>We’ve all heard about the dangers of Tide pods, and with good reason: the enzymes used to loosen dirt from clothing can cause nausea, vomiting, shock, convulsions, and coma if ingested. Dish soap can also cause nausea, though it’s not usually fatal. But even without swallowing detergents, excessive exposure can cause <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743221\">respiratory problems</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Keep detergent away from children, especially if you use “fun”-looking pods.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Luckily, <a href=\"https://www.greenmatters.com/living/2017/06/22/iKecy/healthiest-laundry-detergents\">non-toxic alternatives to laundry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/guides/categories/5-Dishwashing\">dish detergent</a> are pretty widely available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mothballs\">Moth balls</h3>\n<p>In addition to smelling terrible, these things contain <a href=\"http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/mothball/health.html\">naphthalene and p-dichlorobenzene</a>, which can cause headaches, dizziness, and irritation to the skin and eyes. Over time, they might even lead to cataract formation or liver damage. Eek!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: If you decide to use mothballs anyway, make sure kids and pets can’t get at them.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Blessedly, there are safer and <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-to-prevent-get-rid-of-fabr-109733\">better-smelling alternatives</a>. Moths hate the smell of cedar, lavender, rosemary, thyme, mint, ginseng, eucalyptus, peppercorns, lemon, and cloves. Try sachets or essential oils with these scents to keep the moths at bay. And remember: it’s the smell that bothers them, so refresh these every few months or as the smell fades.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"motoroil\">Motor oil</h3>\n<p>Motor oil can absorb heavy metals that are toxic to humans and animals. Disposed of improperly, motor oil can contaminate groundwater. If ingested, the substance can cause vomiting and <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/articles/my-child-just-took-a-swig-of-motor-oil-173\">aspiration</a> (i.e., drawing the liquid into the lungs, especially while vomiting). Aspiration is serious and usually requires an ER visit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Dispose of used motor oil in a sealed plastic container. Don’t put it in the trash (that’s illegal). Instead, call your local auto parts store about options for recycling the oil.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: None, really. Just handle safely!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"windshieldwasherfluid\">Windshield washer fluid</h3>\n<p>This stuff contains methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol, which can be deadly if ingested, which should be no surprise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Keep it in a sealed container, out of reach of children.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: You can <a href=\"https://www.diynatural.com/homemade-windshield-washer-fluid/\">make your own</a>, but it’s worth noting that the stuff you buy at the store is really only harmful if you drink it.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in doubt, read the label and follow directions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part2hiddenhouseholdtoxinsandalternatives\">Part 2: Hidden Household Toxins (and Alternatives)</h2>\n<p>Chances are, you already had a general idea about most of what we mentioned in part one: it’s not exactly a secret that ingesting non-food substances can be toxic. In this section, we’ll dive into some potentially toxic substances that might be hiding in harmless-seeming stuff around your house.</p>\n<p>One quick note: reading this information can get overwhelming. Most of us are using a lot of the products listed here. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, jump to Part 3: Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic. While there are a lot of potential household toxins out there, the changes you’ll need to make to eliminate them are fairly simple – and often, one change gets rid of several problematic substances at once.</p>\n<p>Okay. Deep breath. Here we go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"atrazine\">Atrazine</h3>\n<p>The second-most-widely used herbicide in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=336&tid=59\">atrazine</a> is famous (or maybe infamous) for causing male fish and frogs develop female genitalia. In humans, it can cause infertility. It may also be carcinogenic, but researchers haven’t yet gathered enough information to make a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: The easiest way to avoid atrazine is by eating organic food and reducing your meat consumption. Why less meat? Many animals eat corn, which is often treated with atrazine, which can bring the substance into your body. If you can find meat from organic-fed animals, you may be safer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bisphenolabpa\">Bisphenol A (BPA)</h3>\n<p>This is a component in plastics and is used in water bottles, on receipts, and in canned food linings. It’s what’s called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A\">xenoestrogen</a>, meaning that it behaves somewhat like the hormone and can also interact with sex hormones in the human body. While the substance is controversial, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm064437.htm?_cldee=a2F0aHJ5bl9zdGpvaG5AYW1lcmljYW5jaGVtaXN0cnkuY29t\">authorities in the US</a> and <a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150121\">Europe</a> haven’t found enough evidence to definitively link it to any negative health outcomes – but some people are still proceeding with caution.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: The good news here is that you can avoid BPA pretty easily. Manufacturers aren’t required to disclose its use, but you can assume that if a metal can isn’t labeled “BPA-free,” it has the substance in its lining. Avoid BPA by choosing those cans that are labeled “BPA-free,” or choosing glass jars or fresh or frozen food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dioxins\">Dioxins</h3>\n<p>These substances (and similar substances like DDT and PCBs) are a byproduct of industrial processes like paper bleaching and trash incineration. In the body, they’ve been linked to decreased fertility, diabetes, cancer, endometriosis, immune system problems, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: The bad news is that <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health\">nobody can avoid dioxins altogether</a>. But you can reduce the amount you take into your body by limiting the amount of fatty animal products you consume. That’s because dioxins are stored in animals’ fatty tissues. Note: going organic here won’t help because dioxins come from air and water rather than animals’ food supply.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flameretardants\">Flame retardants</h3>\n<p>Flame retardants are in lots of stuff: furniture, kids’ supplies, bedding, and more. Some of the substances in them (including polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs) have been <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=900&tid=94\">linked</a> to fertility problems, thyroid problems, and neurobehavioral changes in the young – but at this point, most of those findings are from animal studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Actually, don’t avoid them! Flame retardants can save your life and your home. To minimize the impact of any toxic substances they contain, dust and vacuum your home regularly. The toxic parts get into your system by binding to dust particles; the less dust, the less damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"formaldehyde\">Formaldehyde</h3>\n<p>This baby’s a nasty one. A <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet\">known carcinogen</a>, it can also cause respiratory and eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, and headaches in the <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=218&tid=39\">short term</a>. Far from being confined to the labs of mad scientists to preserve newts, formaldehyde is present in pressed-wood products (particleboard, wood paneling, plywood), foam insulation, latex paints, wallpaper, some synthetic fabrics, and some personal care products.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: Choose hardwood furniture when possible (you can ask for a formaldehyde testing report). Invest in air-filtering plants like the bamboo palm or the <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">peace lily</a> to help keep your home’s air toxin-free.</p>\n<h3 id=\"glycolethers\">Glycol ethers</h3>\n<p>We mentioned earlier that glycol-based substances might be in your antifreeze or windshield fluid. Glycol ethers are also found in dry cleaning chemicals, some personal care products, and some home cleaners.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Skip dry cleaning whenever possible and make your own cleaning products at home. Tips and recipes for doing that in Part 3!</p>\n<h3 id=\"lead\">Lead</h3>\n<p>Lead causes a lot of well-documented health problems, including impaired development of the brain and nervous system. Newer research suggests it may also affect the body’s ability to regulate stress hormones.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: For most people, the biggest risk of lead exposure is via paint, which legally contained lead in the United States <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips.htm\">until 1978</a>. In some parts of the country, lead in the water is also a problem, in part because of lead pipes and socioeconomic inequalities that we won’t get into right now.</p>\n<p>The best ways to avoid lead are these:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your house is older than 1978, assume there’s lead paint in it. Consider renovating to eliminate the lead, but consult a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-abatement-inspection-and-risk-assessment\">lead remediation professional</a> first. If you’re pregnant, avoid the renovation area.</li>\n<li>If you live in an area with lead in the water, buy a <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2016/02/how-filter-lead-your-tap-water\">filter</a> that can eliminate it.</li>\n<li>Eat a healthy diet, as that can help your body absorb less lead.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mercury\">Mercury</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health\">Mercury</a> is most dangerous to young children and pregnant women (because it can hurt the development of the fetus). It can be toxic to the nervous system, digestive system, immune system, and can damage the lungs, eyes, skin, and kidneys.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: In the United States, most people’s biggest exposure comes from seafood. Limit your consumption to animals low on the food chain – generally, the smaller the animal, the less mercury it contains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organophosphatepesticides\">Organophosphate pesticides</h3>\n<p>These pesticides are very common and have been tied to a number of health problems, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560399/\">cardiovascular diseases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20435691\">endocrine disruption</a> (though more research may be needed to show a definitive link).</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: The easiest way to avoid these toxins is to choose organic food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perchlorate\">Perchlorate</h3>\n<p>Used in rocket fuel, this chemical can prevent your thyroid from absorbing iodine properly. And your thyroid needs iodine to function.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: Unfortunately, you really can’t: it’s in groundwater, food, and more. But if you get enough iodine in your diet, you’ll diminish its impact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfluorinatedchemicalspfcs\">Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs)</h3>\n<p>Branded as Teflon and Stainmaster, these toxins can <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Health_effects_PFCs_Oct_2010.pdf\">impact the function of the thyroid</a> and have been linked to infertility in men and women.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: PFCs are primarily used to make “non-stick” dishes and cooking utensils and to make products stain-, water-, or grease-repellant (pizza boxes, microwave popcorn bags, pet food bags, etc.).</p>\n<p>Opt for stainless steel, copper, or cast iron cooking gear, and for clothing that’s made waterproof with polyurethane rather than Gore-tex. Opt for glass containers to store food. If you’re a popcorn fanatic (as this writer is), <a href=\"https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-stove-top-popcorn/\">learn how to make stovetop popcorn</a>. It’s super easy and way more delicious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"phthalates\">Phthalates</h3>\n<p>Phthalates are used to keep plastic flexible and sturdy. They’re found in all kinds of materials: vinyl products like shower curtains, PVC plastics, synthetic scents, nail polish, fake leather, and some plastic food containers. Some forms of phthalates are <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=377&tid=65\">known carcinogens</a>. In the shorter term, contact with phthalates can cause nausea, respiratory system irritation, stomach irritation, damage to the central nervous system, liver and kidney damage, headaches, and loss of coordination.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Whenever possible, choose glass or metal to store food. Opt for natural fibers (like cotton) and choose a nylon (or other non-vinyl) shower curtain. Avoid synthetic scents. Note: these compounds made some cool plastic applications possible, but they’re an <a href=\"https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/repair/vinyl-siding-lethal1.htm\">environmental bummer</a> at every stage of their lifecycle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While there are a lot of potential household toxins out there, the changes you’ll need to make to eliminate them are fairly simple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part3simplewaystomakeyourhomelesstoxic\">Part 3: Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic</h2>\n<p>So the bad news is that there are a lot of potentially toxic substances in most people’s homes. But the good news is that making a few simple changes can greatly reduce your exposure to household toxins. As an added benefit, many of these changes will also allow you to save money and reduce your environmental impact. A win-win-win.</p>\n<p>Here are four simple changes to try.</p>\n<h3 id=\"switchoutnonstickpans\">Switch out nonstick pans</h3>\n<p>As we mentioned above, cast-iron, stainless steel, and copper cookware are all less-toxic alternatives to Teflon. If you don’t have a huge budget, check out second-hand stores and flea markets for some killer deals. Because of their chemical composition, these replacement pots and pans are typically safe even in an “encore life.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"brewyourowncleaningproducts\">Brew your own cleaning products</h3>\n<p>You can replace pretty much any toxic cleaning agent with some combination of these ingredients (<a href=\"https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/non-toxic-home-cleaning/\">full recipes</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baking soda</li>\n<li>White vinegar</li>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n<li>Cornstarch</li>\n<li>Olive or vegetable oil</li>\n<li>Hydrogen peroxide</li>\n<li>Washing soda</li>\n<li>Oxygen bleach</li>\n<li>Lemon juice and peels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to get fancy, you can add essential oils to your concoctions so they smell the way you like.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buyorganicfood\">Buy organic food</h3>\n<p>Yes, organic food is more expensive. But if you can afford it, swapping organics for food grown with chemical fertilizer can cut a lot of your toxin exposure. And don’t feel like this is an all-or-nothing proposition. If you’re on a tight budget, focus on getting organic versions of the “<a href=\"https://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/news/2018-dirty-dozen-and-clean-fifteen-lists-rank-produce-items-by-pesticide-level/\">dirty (baker’s) dozen</a>” foods – those that tend to absorb the highest levels of toxic chemicals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"switchoutplasticcontainers\">Switch out plastic containers</h3>\n<p>Plastic is everywhere, but it’s not great for the planet and it may also leech toxic substances into your food and beverages. The solution? Switch to glass or stainless steel containers to the extent possible. Again, you can find great deals at secondhand shops to avoid spending an arm and a leg.</p>\n<p>One final thought here: there’s no such thing as a toxin-free home, but if you’re trying to reduce the number of substances that can cause irritation in the short term and that might have serious negative health consequences in the long term, making small changes like these can help.</p>"

    body: "<p>If your Florida home was built before 2001, there’s a good chance your roof is missing a very important detail: a third nail in its metal hurricane truss straps. Homes built before the 2002 Florida Building Code took effect weren’t required to have this extra nail that makes the roof more resistant to hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>What difference can a single nail make? Well, for starters, it can upgrade your roof-to-wall attachment on your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a> from “toenails” to “clips.” That one change may help you save <strong>20% to 50%</strong> on your home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarehurricaneclips\">What are hurricane clips?</h2>\n<p>Florida homes built after 2001 are required to have hurricane clips. These are steel connectors that attach your roof to your wall structure and are designed to withstand hurricane winds that hit your walls and put upward pressure on the overhang of your roof. In other words, they help keep the lid on.</p>\n<p>On section four of your wind mitigation inspection, your connection may count as a clip if it’s secured to the truss / rafters with three nails.</p>\n<p>Hurricane clips offer much more protection than “toe nails” – the diagonal nails driven through the side of the roof truss into the top of the wall plate. This roof-to-wall attachment was popular in older homes, but it doesn’t provide much wind resistance for the roof.</p>\n<p>The good news is that if you have toe nail attachments, it may be easier to upgrade to hurricane clips than you might realize. It may just require an additional nail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hurricaneclipsvsstraps\">Hurricane clips vs straps</h3>\n<p>The terms “hurricane clip” and “hurricane strap” are often used interchangeably, and that’s usually accurate enough for most people. Hurricane clips may also be called:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hurricane ties.</li>\n<li>Hurricane strips.</li>\n<li>Hurricane anchors.</li>\n<li>Hurricane brackets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, hurricane clip usually describes a small bent steel plate that connects the roof of your home to wall trusses supporting it. Hurricane straps are more likely to be long, straight strips of metal or nylon.</p>\n<p>Both hurricane clips and straps harden your home against wind damage, but it’s important to note that a Florida wind mitigation report specifically mentions clips. In fact, separates them into two categories: Metal connectors that do not wrap over trusses and rafters and those that do and are secured with three nails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arehurricaneclipsrequiredinotherstates\">Are hurricane clips required in other states?</h3>\n<p>Because hurricane clips do a better job of protecting homes against hurricane-force winds, several Gulf States require them in new construction in addition to Florida. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alabama:</strong> Hurricane ties are required on all new homes, with no more than 30 nails used per tie. Only end trusses must be strapped, and two ties must be installed per door or window.</li>\n<li><strong>Georgia:</strong> Every new home in the state must have metal hurricane straps installed on gable ends, where the roof meets the wall, and on all hip roofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Mississippi:</strong> All new homes must be built with four hurricane ties per window or door, and the ties must be able to withstand winds up to 110 mph.</li>\n<li><strong>Louisiana:</strong> New homes must have hurricane ties and <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a>. Moreover, you’re required to hire a licensed contractor to install them or you may be fined.</li>\n<li><strong>South Carolina:</strong> Hurricane straps are required on all new homes. If you’re planning to build, you need a licensed engineer to approve your straps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtoupdateyourrooftowallattachmentfromtoenailstohurricaneclips\">How to update your roof-to-wall attachment from toe nails to hurricane clips</h2>\n<p>Some companies, like LGT Restoration Services, Inc. and Maximum Solutions in Florida, specialize in retrofitting older homes to adhere to current wind mitigation standards. They offer easy updates from dual nail roof truss straps systems with a third nail.</p>\n<p>Third Nail can work on most exteriors for hurricane strap retrofits, whether your home has aluminum, vinyl, metal, or wood siding. They specialize in servicing the southern half of Florida. Maximum Solutions operates throughout the state.</p>\n<p>We often recommend both companies, whose contractors are properly insured and licensed, to make sure our homeowners have a reliable and affordable way to update their roof-to-wall attachments and <strong>qualify for bigger wind mitigation savings</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are several reputable companies throughout Florida that offer this upgrade. When searching for other companies, do your research and <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">make sure contractors are properly licensed</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoeshurricaneclipretrofittingcost\">How much does hurricane clip retrofitting cost?</h2>\n<p>Retrofitting costs for most homes range from at $850 to $1,350, which includes a wind mitigation inspection (these usually cost about $100). Your exact cost depends on the company you use, whether the retrofit can be done in your attic, the retrofitting upgrade you choose, and your home’s square footage.</p>\n<p><strong>Call us at 855-717-0022 today</strong> and we’ll crunch the potential insurance savings for you. If you stand to save a lot by getting this upgrade, we’ll connect you with a trusted third nail service provider in your area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcanyousavewithhurricaneclips\">How much can you save with hurricane clips?</h2>\n<p>Upgrading your attachment from toe nails to clips <strong>can help you save 20% to 50%</strong> on your yearly home insurance premium. All Florida home insurance companies are required to offer discounts for wind mitigation measures. However, the discount amount varies from company to company.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, the more wind resistant your home is, the less you’ll pay for your home insurance. You can learn more about how to make your home resistant to hurricane winds with our <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">wind mitigation guide</a>.</p>\n<p>On average, Kin customers who upgrade from toe nails to clips / singe-wraps <strong>save 37%</strong> on their premium – hundreds of dollars in savings each year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/contact/\">Get in touch with us today</a> to see how much you’ll save on your home insurance with hurricane clips.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in June 2022.

    body: "<p>Hurricane Ida was a fast developing storm, escalating from tropical storm to Category 1 in a matter of hours. By August 29, 2021, Ida reached Category 3 only to intensify to a Category 4 in an hour. The storm ultimately became one of the most damaging and deadly hurricanes to hit Louisiana, tying Hurricane Laura and the 1856 Last Island Hurricane as the strongest in the state. And, of course, the destruction didn’t end there as the remnants of Ida caused heavy rains, flash floods, and tornados in the Northeast.</p>\n<p>Hurricane Ida is a good reminder of just how quickly a storm can build into something dangerous. It's our job to help customers weather both the storm and its aftermath.</p>\n<p>Here's a look at how we use technology to triage catastrophic claims and keep our customers prepared.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Srd-FX-5BC4?autoplay=0&rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Video Transcript</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 1): We have ominous news coming from the Hurricane Hunters as they continue to track Hurricane Ida.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): The National Hurricane center is warning that Ida will bring life-threatening storm surge, potentially catastrophic wind damage, and flooding rainfall.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper, Co-founder & CEO): Climate change unfortunately is actually accelerating; it's intensifying. And in a decade, there really won't be anywhere to run from it. It's the new normal and we're prepared to meet these challenges head-on while helping our customers to do the same.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): The effects of Ida are already being felt, a Category 3 hurricane, wind up to 120 miles per hour as it makes landfall in Cuba.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Angel Conlin, Chief Insurance Officer): Hurricane Ida is a reminder to all homeowners that storms can rapidly intensify into life-threatening events, so we really need to prepare. At Kin, we truly care about our customers' safety. We're here for them in the long term and in emergent situations. We work to educate our members on ways they can harden their homes to better withstand storms and other events. That's one of the reasons Kin continuously monitors catastrophic events that could reach our customers. We analyze potentially developing storms, track the path of events, and model the potential impact on our policyholders. This allows us to be there for our members when they need us most.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper): Technology is really important in insurance, and it's at the center of everything that we do.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt, VP of Data Science): We're able to combine tons of data in near real-time in order to understand the impact of various events. So, for instance, when Ida was coming, we were able to take data from the National Hurricane Center and other data sources and take that that layer of geospatial data and overlay it on our book of policies to understand how our policyholders might be impacted by the storm.</em></p>\n<p>_(Angel Conlin): Ida's path had enough certainty that we triggered our automated pre-event text messages to all of our members in the projected path of the storm. With our pre-event texts, we proactively let our customers know the storm was coming and we provided custom resources with safety tips and ways they could prepare for the hurricane.</p>\n<p>(News anchor 2): Hurricane Ida is forecast to be a large, powerful, dangerous hurricane, a category 4 at landfall._</p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt): 24 hours before landfall, residents were evacuating. To help our members stay safe, we sent a second pre-event text that encouraged policyholders to download the FEMA app for weather alerts, shelter listings, and safety tips. We also continued to update our lists of customers who may be impacted by low risk, moderate risk, and potentially high-risk wind speeds. That allowed us to closely monitor high-risk properties for damage and customer safety.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): Five hours after landfall, Hurricane Ida was still a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 miles an hour.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Clay Rising, VP of Claims): Ida made landfall on August 29, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was the most devastating and costly hurricane in Louisiana's history. Because of Kin's use of technology and data science, our experienced claims team was well prepared to support our customers. As soon as the storm passed, we sent wellness checks to all of our members in the path to make sure they were safe and to determine how we could help. Our policyholders texted back with insights that helped us understand the ground impact of the storm in real time.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt): If a customer notifies us that they've evacuated, we're able to flag them for immediate post-storm review using aerial imagery.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Clay Rising): After a major event, it can take a few days to get adjusters on the ground, but because we have aerial imagery that shows a roof is damaged or not, we don't have to wait for boots on the ground to know that a home has been damaged. So we can get the process started and pay customers for damage faster. A lot of methods of communication change after a major storm ‚ there's no power, no internet, no cell phone service. So we have to adapt and contact people any way possible and get claims started via text message because it's often the only form of communication that's working.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Angel Conlin): By day five, we had aerial imagery available for 94 percent of our affected policyholders.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper): We're always keeping the customer in the loop so that they know what's happening and what they should be doing to prepare. In terms of sustained maximum wind speed at landfall, Hurricane Ida ties with Hurricane Laura and the 1856 Last Island Hurricane. These are the strongest storms on record to make landfall in Louisiana. Then it went on and it caused major flash floods throughout the Northeast, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. This is a reminder that our climate is changing faster than ever. Storms like Ida will be the new normal. Our customers deserve an insurance company that is prepared for it.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"usingtechnologytopredicthurricaneidaspath\">Using Technology to Predict Hurricane Ida’s Path</h2>\n<p>Technology is the backbone of everything we do at Kin, so the moment we learned there was a potentially cataclysmic event developing in the Caribbean, we put that tech to work. We began tracking Ida’s path before it ever hit Cuba, using geospatial data from the National Hurricane Center and layering it on top of our book of business. This allowed us to anticipate who among our policyholders were most likely going to feel the effects of the storm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alertingpolicyholderstotheupcomingstorm\">Alerting Policyholders to the Upcoming Storm</h3>\n<p>But that prediction is most useful when we share it with the people who may be in harm’s way, so the next step was to send out the first of two pre-event texts. This text alerted our policyholders who we predicted to be in Ida’s path that they may be vulnerable to hurricane damage and provided them with custom resources and tips to keep them and their property safe.</p>\n<p>That first pre-event text went out on August 27﹘two days before Ida made landfall in Louisiana. The very next day we sent the second pre-event text. By then, Louisianans were evacuating, so this text encouraged our policyholders to download the Federal Emergency Management Agency app for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weather alerts.</li>\n<li>Shelter locations.</li>\n<li>Additional safety tips.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this was going on, our team continued to collect data so we could update our list of customers in Ida’s path and categorize them by their potential degree of impact. We did this to keep an eye both on our customers’ safety and the areas with the highest probability for damage and claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howaerialimageryspeedsuphurricaneidaclaims\">How Aerial Imagery Speeds Up Hurricane Ida Claims</h2>\n<p>The aftermath of any storm is when it’s most important for us to get in contact with our clients. They’ve just gone through the trauma of a hurricane, and now they have to deal with filing claims and repairing damage. The sooner they can get that process moving, the closer they are to getting back to normal.</p>\n<p>This is why we also send out a post-event wellness check text. That gives us a chance to check in and see how our policyholders are doing. Plus, 58 percent of these texts get a response. And if a customer indicates they’ve been evacuated, we can flag them for immediate post-storm review.</p>\n<p>Aerial imagery is a key component of this. Vendors provide the imagery, and we leverage internal and external insights to analyze the images. If we determine one of our policyholder’s has a damaged roof, we don’t have to wait for the roads to clear or internet service to come back online to get their claim started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/aerial-imagery.png\" alt=\"aerial imagery of houses after hurricane ida\" /></p>\n<p>By using these technologies, we’re able to get claims started and processed faster for our customers. That’s our number one goal: to help our customers when they need us most.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acommitmenttocustomersinachangingclimate\">A Commitment to Customers in a Changing Climate</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-and-home-insurance/\">climate is changing</a> and that means Hurricane Ida is probably not the last record-breaking storm that will affect our customers. Our focus on technology means we can handle their claims no matter what their new normal looks like.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"readyyourhomeforhurricaneseason\">Ready Your Home for Hurricane Season</h2>\n<p>Hurricane-proofing your home is usually called “<a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a>” – a term you often see while shopping for <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. If you take steps to secure your roof against wind damage, it will often save you the most money on your home insurance premium. You can learn more about the technical details of wind mitigation systems in our article “<a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">Florida Wind Mitigation Breakdown</a>.”</p>\n<p>Unlike reinforcing your roof, the following hurricane-proofing pointers will focus on action items you may be able to handle on your own without a contractor’s help. This includes installing or procuring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure outdoor furniture</li>\n<li>Install storm shutters</li>\n<li>Brace your doors</li>\n<li>Check your caulk</li>\n<li>Stock up on emergency supplies</li>\n<li>Check your hurricane deductible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list can serve as both a checklist and a basic shopping list for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">hurricane season</a>. Let’s review each item.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1secureoutdoorfurniture\">1. Secure Outdoor Furniture</h3>\n<p>When the wind picks up, loose items in your own backyard can cause big damage to your home.</p>\n<p>Think about what you keep outdoors. Do you have patio furniture, planters, or garbage cans? Invest in the receptacles that can safely store these items before a storm approaches, whether that’s a shed or a large storage container anchored securely. You can also secure your patio furniture before in climate weather hits.</p>\n<p>You might also consider reducing the amount of heavy things in your yard or on your patio so you have less to worry about before a storm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2secureyourwindows\">2. Secure Your Windows</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">Hurricane shutters</a> and storm-proof glass can make your home more resilient to wind damage</p>\n<p>The shutter itself doesn’t need to be a permanent installation, but the tracts and fasteners should be. Invest in high-quality shutters that include these features. If you’re interested in making your own, look for “CDX” on plywood that is at least 5/8 inch thick. Plylox can also be a good option, if available.</p>\n<p>Shatter-proof, wind-resistant glass runs about $40 to $50 per square foot. However, this investment can spare you from shattered windows and another entry point for stormwater. Plus, this upgrade can help lower home insurance premiums.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3braceyourdoors\">3. Brace Your Doors</h3>\n<p>Once your windows are protected, consider your exterior doors.</p>\n<p>Fiberglass doors are most secure, as are double doors (an outer and inner door combined in one). They also often come with reinforcement kits for more added protection.</p>\n<p>Garage doors can be the largest and the weakest opening to your home. Make sure they are as secure as possible to protect your roof from internal pressure. A combination of horizontal and vertical bracing plates offers good protection. And if a big upgrade is in your cards, remember that metal garage doors are most durable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4checkyourcaulking\">4. Check Your Caulking</h3>\n<p>Stormwater can get into more places than a conventional rainstorm. A basic way to fight against water damage is to check the caulking around your home.</p>\n<p>This is especially crucial if you have electrical wires coming inside of your home from the outside. Consider sealing the entry point.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5stockuponemergencysupplies\">5. Stock Up on Emergency Supplies</h3>\n<p>Hurricane-proof your house <em>and</em> your home by thinking about what you’ll need to get through the actual ordeal of a hurricane.</p>\n<p>Stock your pantry with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-perishable foods</li>\n<li>Instant meals that can be prepared without heat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For water, a good rule of thumb is one gallon per person, per day.</p>\n<p>Now, look at your communication devices. Make sure you have a way to power them in an emergency and consider investing in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portable chargers</li>\n<li>Batteries</li>\n<li>Mechanically powered generators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although medical supplies may be a no-brainer, hygiene supplies are often overlooked. Make sure to pack what you need to keep your body clean and healthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6checkyourhurricanedeductible\">6. Check Your Hurricane Deductible</h3>\n<p>There’s only so much any human can do to withstand the force of mother nature. That’s why hurricane insurance exists!</p>\n<p>Check your home insurance policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>. This is the amount you will have to pay before your coverage pays for hurricane wind damage to your home and belongings. Can you comfortably pay this amount out of pocket with little notice? If not, you may want to talk to your insurance agent about lowering your deductible.</p>\n<p>Hurricanes are a powerful force of nature, and the right preparation is essential for safeguarding yourself. Find out <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-facts/\">interesting facts about hurricanes </a>and what makes them powerful in our handy guide.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you live in South Florida or other hurricane-prone areas of the country, you will likely benefit from impact-resistant windows on your home.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll offer an overview of what impact-resistant windows are, how to determine whether you home needs them, how to determine whether your home already has them, and what to expect in terms of cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"impactresistantglassrequirements\">Impact-Resistant Glass Requirements</h2>\n<p>Impact-resistant windows (also sometimes called impact windows, hurricane windows, or laminated glass) are windows specifically designed to withstand the stresses of hurricanes, including high winds and projectiles moving at high speeds.</p>\n<p>Structurally, impact-resistant windows are made of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two panes of shatter-resistant glass</strong>. If the exterior glass is shattered by a projectile, the inner layer remains, protecting the house. Because of the way the glass is designed, it doesn’t break into dangerous shards.</li>\n<li><strong>An adhesive layer holding the panes together</strong>. This might be PVB, EVA, or resin. It’s the same substance used in car windows to prevent shattering.</li>\n<li><strong>A strong frame</strong>. Frames may be either metal (typically steel or aluminum), vinyl, or wood. Metal frames are the strongest and most expensive; wood frames are the least expensive to install, but require more maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But not every double-paned window is considered impact resistant. In fact, to get the official “impact resistant” designation from <a href=\"https://www.astm.org/\">American Society for Testing and Materials</a> (ASTM), windows must pass a series of rigorous tests.</p>\n<p>Impact resistance testing involves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Large missile impact</strong>: For South Florida homes, this test involves hurling a nine-pound wooden two-by-four at the window at 80 feet per second, first at the center of the pane and then at its edges. To pass, the glass must not shatter at either impact. (For homes outside South Florida, the missiles are lobbed at slower speeds.)</li>\n<li><strong>Small missile impact</strong>: In this test, bits of gravel or steel ball bearings are lobbed at the glass at 80 feet per second.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind simulation</strong>: In this portion, testers simulate wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. To pass, the window has to maintain structural integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assuming a window passes these tests, it’s certified as impact resistant. But how do you know if your house needs these specialty windows? The biggest factor is where you live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedsimpactresistantwindows\">Who Needs Impact Resistant Windows?</h2>\n<p>While anyone worried about storm damage can install impact-resistant windows, people in Florida’s most hurricane-prone regions can benefit most.</p>\n<p>Each region of the state of Florida has a designated hurricane-evacuation code, identified by a letter of the alphabet. Those in zones closer to the start of the alphabet (A, B, C) are most vulnerable to hurricane damage, including storm surges, high winds, and loose debris. These are also the people who benefit most from impact-resistant windows.</p>\n<p>(Not sure which zone you’re in? <a href=\"https://floridadisaster.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c788060028cb43809a25744ead39c0d6\">Enter your address here to check</a>.)</p>\n<p>Impact-resistant windows protect those in the path of a hurricane in three important ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They don’t break into shards, which means they prevent glass shards from flying through the air and causing injury or property damage.</li>\n<li>Their double-pane structure means that even if the outer pane shatters, the inner pane prevents water from damaging the home.</li>\n<li>By keeping your home sealed, these windows prevent hurricane winds from getting inside and significantly raising the air pressure inside your home, which can lead to the collapse of walls and roofs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last form of protection is actually the most important one. Structure collapse from changed air pressure is much more devastating and expensive than damage caused by water getting onto your stuff.</p>\n<p>Not a homeowner in Florida’s top hurricane-evacuation zones? You may still benefit from impact-resistant windows if you’re looking for a way to protect your home from UV damage (hurricane windows also block most UV rays) or to dampen sound (impact windows are great at reducing sound).</p>\n<p>If you do need impact-resistant windows, you’ll probably have to have a hurricane protection company install them for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcanyoutellifyoualreadyhaveimpactresistantwindows\">How Can You Tell if You Already Have Impact-Resistant Windows?</h2>\n<p>If you’re not sure whether the windows in your home are impact resistant, a visual inspection should give you the information you need. Follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Look in the corner of the pane</strong>. Often, suppliers mark their glass with their name, the date the glass was manufactured, and technical specifications about what the window can withstand. If there’s no mark etched into the glass, there may be a stick-on notice with the same information.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your reflection</strong>. Because impact-resistant windows are made up of two panes of glass, they’ll show two reflections (instead of the single reflection a normal window will show). For best results, wait until it’s dark out to try this.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the deed to your house</strong>. As of July 2001, all homes built in South Florida are <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ARAwindmitigation.pdf\">required to have impact-resistant windows</a>. If you’re not sure when your home was built, check your deed, which will show all past owners and their years of ownership. If the dates go back no further than 2001, there’s a good chance your windows are impact-resistant (assuming you’re in South Florida).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if you don’t have impact-resistant hurricane windows and you likely need them based on your hurricane evacuation zone, what should you do? Read on to understand the cost of installing impact-resistant windows, plus a few alternatives for those on a tight budget.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoimpactresistantwindowscost\">How Much Do Impact-Resistant Windows Cost?</h2>\n<p>Impact-resistant windows cost more than standard windows. But they can also protect you from serious damage and may qualify you for lower <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> premiums (ask your insurance company for details).</p>\n<p>While impact-resistant windows with hurricane shutters are the gold standard for homes in South Florida and other areas affected by hurricanes, they are not the only way to mitigate your risk of hurricane damage. Here’s a look at how impact-resistant windows and some alternatives stack up.</p>\n<p>| Damage prevention solution | Cost | Professional installation required? | Homeowners insurance premium reduction available? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Impact-resistant windows | $40 – $55 / square foot | Yes | Yes |\n| Hurricane shutters | $10 – $50 / square foot | No | No |\n| Hurricane-resistant film | $25 / square foot | No | No |\n| Plywood | $5 – $6 / square foot | No | No |</p>\n<p>If a hurricane is on the way and you don’t have time to install impact-resistant windows, it’s better to do something (e.g., cover your windows with plywood) than nothing. But for superior long-term protection, impact-resistant windows can’t be beat.</p>\n<p>In new construction, opting for impact-resistant windows will only raise the cost of the home by a few thousand dollars. It’s possible that you’d recover this savings within a few years of reduced homeowners insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>For existing homes, the potential to recover your investment via smaller insurance premiums is also significant.</p>\n<p>In other words, a small investment today can save you money over and over in the years to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherwaystoprotectyourhomefromhurricanes\">Other Ways to Protect Your Home from Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>![windows-6](https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/windows-6.jpg?width=300&amp;name=windows-6.jpg =300x)Hurricanes are one of the most destructive forces of nature. If you live in South Florida or another hurricane-prone area, you’ll want to do more than verify that you’ve got impact-resistant windows. Other ways to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">protect your home from a hurricane</a> include these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Update your roof</a> per wind mitigation guidelines. Certain types of roof construction can both reduce your risk of wind damage and lower your homeowners insurance premiums.</li>\n<li>Verify that you have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. Flood insurance is not included in standard homeowners policies. If you’re in a hurricane danger zone, be sure you purchase this coverage separately.</li>\n<li>Maintain your home consistently. Regular <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance</a> can prevent small problems from becoming big ones. Cleaning your gutters, for example, can ensure that water runs through them rather than getting clogged and leaking into your attic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still not sure whether you have or need impact-resistant windows? <a href=\"/contact/\">Get in touch with us</a>, and we’ll help you figure it out.</p>"

    body: "<p>Home insurance covers your home, belongings, and other structures for common sources of damage, like fire, theft, wind, hail, vandalism, smoke, and more. But it also covers <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>For example, your policy’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability insurance</a> can help out if your child accidentally sends a baseball through the neighbor’s window. You also get medical payments coverage to help pay for immediate medical expenses when your guests have a small injury at your home. And if a covered claim keeps you from living at home, loss of use coverage can help cover those extra living expenses: hotel stays, transportation, dining out, and more.</p>\n<p>Because your policy covers much more than your home, an application for an insurance quote will ask some questions about you. These questions impact your eligibility and rate.</p>\n<p>Here’s the information you might be asked for when applying for coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"informationneededforahomeinsurancequote\">Information Needed for a Home Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>Your home is the star of your policy, so most application questions will focus on your home and how you use it. The number of questions you answer depends on the insurer. For example, <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-questions/\">we pull a lot of data about your home automatically</a> so you don’t have to hunt for answers to complex questions.</p>\n<p>Usually home insurance applications ask for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The year your home was built.</li>\n<li>Total number of square feet.</li>\n<li>Number of stories.</li>\n<li>Home finishes such as crown molding or cherry wood cabinets.</li>\n<li>Hazardous features, like a wood-burning stove.</li>\n<li>Maintenance issues, like a leaky roof or outdated electrical.</li>\n<li>Detached structures.</li>\n<li>Safety features, security systems or ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Protection class (i.e., your proximity to a fire department).</li>\n<li>Proximity to high-risk wildfire or <a href=\"/blog/how-are-floodplains-determined-for-homeowners/\">flood zones</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's worth noting that our application prefills a lot of this data for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personalinformationforhomeinsurancequotes\">Personal Information for Home Insurance Quotes</h2>\n<p>Your background can impact your coverage eligibility and your rates. For example, if you’ve never filed a claim, congratulations! Your rates will be much lower – a little thank-you for keeping your home safe.</p>\n<p>Don’t be surprised if your insurance asks for (or pulls) the following information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1yourbirthday\">1. Your Birthday</h3>\n<p>You might wonder why a potential insurer would ask about your birthday. Rest assured, we aren’t trying to learn your astrological sign. Your birthdays lets us know if you're eligible for coverage (you need to be 18 or older) and whether you qualify for age-related discounts. For example, mature homeowners (those 55 years or older) get a discount – our way of recognizing that with age comes wisdom!</p>\n<h3 id=\"2insurancescore\">2. Insurance Score</h3>\n<p>How someone handles their finances is a decent predictor of whether or not they will file claims. Your insurer plugs your credit score into an algorithm to determine your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">insurance score</a>. The higher the score, the lower your premiums may be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3backgroundcheck\">3. Background Check</h3>\n<p>Most insurance companies won’t cover applicants who’ve been convicted of arson or fraud. As you might’ve guessed, it’s an indication that the applicant may commit insurance fraud in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4coveragelapses\">4. Coverage Lapses</h3>\n<p>It’s super important to maintain continuous coverage – if not for the safety of your home, then because it keeps your rates lower. Starting and stopping coverage is a big red flag to insurance companies and could mean higher premiums, depending on the duration of the lapse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5claimshistory\">5. Claims History</h3>\n<p>Insurance carriers found that when a person files one homeowners claim, there’s a good chance they will file another one within a year or two. So your <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">claims history</a> does have an impact on how much you'll pay for coverage and whether you're eligible. That said, not all claims drive up rates. The ones outside of your control – like losses caused by a major catastrophe – should not impact your premium like “preventable” claims, such as those caused by a leaky appliance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6homebasedbusiness\">6. Home-Based Business</h3>\n<p>If you run a home-based business that brings visitors to your property, you may not be eligible for coverage from some companies. Your activities qualify as a commercial risk, and you’d need business insurance to cover your liability. Some companies will offer home insurance if you have proof of business insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7primaryresidence\">7. Primary Residence</h3>\n<p>If you live in your home year round, it’s less likely to be broken into or vandalized. Claims tend to be more severe for second homes – if a pipe bursts, it might be weeks or months before someone realizes the problem. That’s a long time for water damage to go unaddressed. While you can get insurance for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/second-home-insurance/\">second home</a> or vacation home, your rates may be slightly higher to reflect the risk.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find coverage, <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">check out this guide for high-risk homes</a>. You may have to work a little harder to find an insurance carrier that can cover you. Insurance carriers may have similar guidelines, but some carriers will insure bigger risks than others. State-run insurance options are also available.</p>"

    body: "<p>Most insurance companies were founded before the invention of color TV. That kind of tenure can be a double-edged sword: sure, the expertise is there, but what about a taste for change? The vision and desire to do things, well, better?</p>\n<p>The truth is the home insurance industry at large is still stuck in the past. While waves of <a href=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/features/2020/04/17/205563.htm\">insurance innovation</a> have come and gone, many insurers still have yet to adapt new data sources that allow for better pricing and underwriting.</p>\n<p>That hurts you, the homeowner, because it results in coverage that may be overpriced yet doesn’t cover your true risk.</p>\n<p>So we do things differently. We use new insurance data sources to help us provide more accurate and fair pricing. This lowers overall <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a> and helps us serve coastal communities that need reliable, affordable insurance options.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how granular insurance data can make a big difference in your experience and the price of your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisdatausedforininsurance\">What is data used for in insurance?</h2>\n<p>To fully understand how new data makes insurance better, it helps to understand <a href=\"https://www.kaplanfinancial.com/resources/getting-started/what-does-an-insurance-underwriter-do\">what insurers consider</a> when evaluating your home for risk. Typically, your home insurance premium is based on a lot of factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your home’s location</strong>. Your location tells us a lot about your risk – like how likely your home is to experience a flood, wildfire, or robbery. It also tells us how easily you can access community resources that can help mitigate the severity of a loss (like your proximity to fire stations). Being able to understand details about a location and topography down to the individual block or property</li>\n<li><strong>Your home’s construction and characteristics</strong>. The age and construction of your home can tell us how well it will endure a big storm or other catastrophe. For example, homes with hip roofs usually better withstand hurricane winds than other roof shapes.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather patterns</strong>. The wind, rain, tides, and storm patterns in your area can impact your chances of loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Claims history</strong>. If you’ve experienced a loss that could have been preventable, it could impact your rates.</li>\n<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granular data helps us get extremely precise insight into these variables instead of working with general data points (or outdated industry standards). The more data an insurance company has, the more accurately it can assess risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtheoldwayofassessingriskincreasesrates\">How the old way of assessing risk increases rates</h2>\n<p>Yes, all insurers use a lot of information to help price their policies. The problem is those rating models are then attributed to entire zip codes or even states.</p>\n<p>That means even if your home has less risk, its baseline pricing is going to be the same as your neighbors.</p>\n<p>This old model doesn’t necessarily factor in characteristics that make your home <em>less</em> risky. For example, say your home sits on top of a knoll in a flood zone. Your home’s elevation affects both homeowners and <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. While you might get a percentage reduction from the baseline price, you are still paying fundamentally the same as your neighbors.</p>\n<p>But when insurance companies embrace technology, everyone wins. Satellite imagery gives detailed information about the geography of your home. Thousands of data points give underwriters a better understanding of the real risk to your property. Using big data, insurance companies don’t just gather information – they compile it into useful details that algorithms run to accurately assess risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdatahelpsunderservedregions\">How data helps underserved regions</h2>\n<p>Florida has more than <a href=\"https://patch.com/florida/southtampa/7-3-million-u-s-homes-risk-hurricane-storm-surge-report\">2.9 million homes</a> at significant risk of storm surge, which historically makes finding home insurance difficult and expensive. Same thing in California: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-cost-of-wildfire-insurance-hurts-california-home-sales-11578220200\">75 percent of the homes in wildfire zones</a> are unable to get traditional fire insurance policies and have to get very limited and expensive FAIR Plan coverage.</p>\n<p>Granular data helps us see the real risk each home has, and that enables us to insure more homeowners in catastrophe-exposed areas. We use satellite imagery and thousands of data points to gather information about each home and determine risk within the home’s neighborhood. So while Home A is still in the risk zone, it might have significantly decreased risk because of its surrounding topography.</p>\n<p>By fairly assessing each property, <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">we can manage risk better and offer lower rates</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingdatatoreinventthecustomerexperience\">Using data to reinvent the customer experience</h2>\n<p>When insurance uses big data, it creates a better customer experience all around. At Kin, we use granular data to help us quantify the frustration many folks have experienced with other insurers, from not being able to get insurance to sky-rocketing premiums to horrible claims experiences. In addition to helping us create new products, cut costs, and operate in regions most impacted by severe weather, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find out what is important to homeowners when it comes to insurance coverage and protection.</li>\n<li>Tailor our marketing to your preferences.</li>\n<li>Optimize your experience by resolving issues quickly.</li>\n<li>Remove inefficiencies in both applying for insurance and processing claims.</li>\n<li>Reduce company overhead and pass savings onto our customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using data and technology to improve the customer experience doesn’t have to be earth shattering, either. Something as simple as drone mapping can help us find the most affected areas after a major storm, and using SMS to check in on customers – like <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">we did after Hurricane Irma</a> – can get the right resources to the right places and jumpstart claims sooner.</p>\n<p>Getting new data sources in place means reimagining legacy systems and old ways of doing business, but it’s worth the effort. What’s more, <a href=\"/reviews/\">our customers seem to agree</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Condo owners in Florida, we are excited to announce we can help you protect your home. We now offer affordable, reliable condo coverage, and as always, you can get a quote in seconds with just your address. Here’s how a <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo policy</a> from Kin benefits you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatho6insurancecovers\">What HO6 Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>If you own a condo, you’re probably familiar with the concept of a “master insurance policy.” This is a policy your condo association usually has to protect the outside of your building. However, the coverage typically ends there. Condo owners are responsible for protecting the rest: from the walls of the structure to everything inside it.</p>\n<p>That’s where <a href=\"/condo-insurance/florida/\">Florida condo insurance</a> comes in. Also called an HO6 insurance policy, this insurance covers the interior of the unit and the personal property inside. For that reason, condo insurance is sometimes referred to as a walls-in or studs-in policy.</p>\n<p>So imagine your area gets a bout of heavy rain, and the roof of your building starts leaking. Water enters your dwelling and damages the ceiling and floors. Here’s how the incident might be handled from the insurance side of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The master policy covers the repair to the roof itself.</li>\n<li>Your policy covers the damage to your floor and ceiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to covering the interior of your condo, an HO6 policy also covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings</a>.</li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> for people injured in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments</a> for immediate visitor injuries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Additional living expenses</a> if you lose use of your condo because of property damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, your condo insurance usually picks up where the condo association’s coverage leaves off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doyouqualifyforcondoinsurance\">Do You Qualify for Condo Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Great question! In short, your residence may be eligible for this policy if it is a condominium.</p>\n<p>However, to get a policy through Kin, you (the owner), a tenant, or both you and a tenant must occupy the residence.</p>\n<p>Of course, other factors like your insurance credit score, claims history, and the condo’s unique characteristics also matter when applying for insurance.</p>\n<p>Ready to see if you can save money on your condo policy?

    body: "<p>If you contribute to a retirement account, you may qualify for extra tax deductions. A tax-deferred retirement account grows money without creating annual tax bills for interest or capital gains.</p>\n<p>Combined with your <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">homeowner tax deductions</a>, these can reduce your tax liability and help you save for retirement faster.</p>\n<p>But not every tax-deferred account gets you a tax deduction in the year you make the contribution. There are three main types of tax-deferred retirement accounts: employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k), traditional IRAs, and Roth IRAs. Of these three, only contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax deductible.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with IRAs to get a better understanding of what is deductible and what isn’t.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This is meant to be educational only. For retirement advice, please seek professional guidance.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"irataxdeductionsataleoftwoiras\">IRA Tax Deductions: A Tale of Two IRAs</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was only one type of IRA: the traditional IRA. It allows you to make a contribution and reduce your annual income dollar for dollar by the amount you contribute. Then came the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/PLAW-105publ34.pdf\">Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997</a> that aimed to send a large flow of tax dollars into the system by giving people an option of how they established their IRA. The Roth IRA was born.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A traditional IRA</strong> is a tax-deductible IRA whose contributions grow tax-deferred.</li>\n<li><strong>A Roth IRA</strong> is a non-deductible IRA whose contributions grow tax-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either of these can be a “contributory” or “rollover” IRA. What that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A contributory IRA</strong> is an account opened to make annual contributions to it.</li>\n<li><strong>A rollover IRA</strong> is opened and funded by a 401k or another IRA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full contribution for 2020 is $6,000. Those who are over the age of 50 can contribute an extra $1,000 to IRA accounts for a total contribution of $7,000.</p>\n<p>You must meet income eligibility requirements to make a full contribution and to be able to deduct some or all of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingirataxdeferrals\">Understanding IRA Tax Deferrals</h2>\n<p>Think of both IRAs as a box. Any money that sits inside the box is sheltered from taxes and the tax-deferred. That means that you can grow $10 to $10,000,000, and as long as it’s in the box, you don’t pay taxes on the interest your account generates.</p>\n<p>How money goes in and out of the box determines your tax deduction or liability now and later.</p>\n<p>Whereas the traditional IRA (in most cases) allows you to deduct contributions for the year, the Roth IRA doesn’t – those contributions are taxed upfront.</p>\n<p>The IRS also handles money coming out of IRAs differently. Because you got a tax deduction on the traditional IRA contributions, you’ll have to pay taxes on it when you retire.</p>\n<p>By contrast, if you didn’t deduct contributions (and therefore paid taxes) for Roth IRA contributions, you can take as much of it out as you want without paying additional taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> What you have in the box is up to you. The IRS allows a lot of investment options as long as the custodian is properly record keeping. These options include savings accounts, stocks, mutual funds, and even gold bullion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taxesontraditionalirasandrothirasanexample\">Taxes on Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs: An Example</h3>\n<p>Say that you invest $6,000 a year starting when you are 35 years old into a traditional IRA. First, you take $6,000 off of your annual income when you file your taxes. Then assume that your account averages six percent of interest each year.</p>\n<p>According to this <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/roth-ira-calculator\">IRA calculator</a>, when you retire at 65, your account would be valued at $524,000 – and you saved $122,771 total in taxes.</p>\n<p>If you then take $100,000 out of the traditional IRA, you add $100,000 to your income. According to the <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/tax-bracket/\">2020 tax brackets</a>, that’s a 24 percent tax bracket for a single person. If your only other income was Social Security, you will have to pay taxes on the distribution and some on your Social Security.</p>\n<p>That same $100,000 coming out of a Roth IRA would not increase your taxable income one penny.</p>\n<p>That’s the real draw of a Roth IRA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iracontributiondeductionlimits\">IRA Contribution &amp; Deduction Limits</h2>\n<p>The tables below give you an idea of whether you can make a contribution to an IRA and whether that contribution is deductible. The limits depend on whether you (or your spouse) have an employer contribution plan, how much money you make, and the type of IRA you want to contribute to.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rothiracontributionlimits\">Roth IRA Contribution Limits</h3>\n<p>| Filing Status | Modified Adjusted Gross Income | Contribution Limits |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Married Filing Jointly | &lt;$196,000 | Up to the limit |\n| ≥$196,000 but &lt;$206,000 | A reduced amount |  |\n| ≥$206,000 | Zero |  |\n| Married Filing Separately | &lt;$10,000 | A reduced amount |\n| ≥$10,000 | Zero |  |\n| Single or Head of Household | &lt;$124,000 | Up to the limit |\n| ≥$124,000 but &lt;$139,000 | A reduced amount |  |\n| ≥$139,000 | Zero |  |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2020\"><em>IRS</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"traditionaliracontributionrequirementsanddeductionswithworkretirementplan\">Traditional IRA Contribution Requirements and Deductions (with Work Retirement Plan)</h3>\n<p>| Filing Status | Modified Adjusted Gross Income | IRA Deduction Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Married Filing Jointly | ≥$104,000 | Full deduction |\n| &gt;$104,000 but <$124,000 | Partial deduction |  |\n| ≥$124,000 | No deduction |  |\n| Married Filing Separately | <$10,000 | Partial deduction |\n| ≥$10,000 | No deduction |  |\n| Single or Head of Household | ≥$65,000 | Full deduction |\n| >$65,000 but &lt;$75,000 | Partial deduction |  |\n| ≥$75,000 | No deduction |  |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/2020-ira-contribution-and-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deductible-contributions-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work\"><em>IRS</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"traditionaliracontributionrequirementsanddeductionswithnoworkretirementplan\">Traditional IRA Contribution Requirements and Deductions (with No Work Retirement Plan)</h3>\n<p>| Filing Status | Modified Adjusted Gross Income | IRA Deduction Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Married Filing Jointly (Spouse Covered by Plan) | &lt;$196,000 | Full deduction |\n| ≥$196,000 but &lt;$206,000 | Partial deduction |  |\n| ≥$206,000 | No deduction |  |\n| Married Filing Jointly (Neither Covered by Plan) | Any amount | Full deduction |\n| Married Filing Separately | &lt;$10,000 | Partial deduction |\n| ≥$10,000 | No deduction |  |\n| Single or Head of Household | Any amount | Full deduction |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/2020-ira-contribution-and-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deductible-contributions-if-you-are-not-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work\"><em>IRS</em></a></p>\n<p>If you’re in a higher income tax bracket, chances are you will have some limitations on whether you can contribute to a Roth or take the full deduction. For those who can’t deduct the contribution to an IRA, you can still contribute to it so the money grows tax-deferred. The good news is that the non-deductible traditional IRA contributions are not going to be taxed when you pull them out – only the growth is taxed upon withdrawal.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that anyone can <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/building-savings/learn-about-iras/convert-to-roth?imm_pid=700000001009716&immid=100785&imm_eid=ep5444719514&&audience=kwd-60567482925&gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8muchrcMbSpMrFK10EkC9flIZ2AVpiG4q-ewlTa9xGgrvcSKcIaEAJAaAvKgEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds\">convert a traditional IRA</a> into a Roth IRA regardless of their income. A conversion takes the value of the traditional IRA, pays the taxes on it, and restructures it as a Roth. This means even if you aren’t eligible for the Roth contribution based on income limitations, you can convert your traditional IRA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"401kdeductionlimits\">401(k) Deduction Limits</h2>\n<p>The other main tax-deferred retirement plan is an employer sponsored plan such as a 401(k).</p>\n<p>When you have an employer-sponsored play such as a 401(k), you don’t need to worry about the reporting since the plan will deduct relevant to the tax election. All 401(k) plans prior to 2006 were traditional, meaning the contributions were deducted from your paycheck prior to taxes, growing tax-deferred like the traditional IRA.</p>\n<p>In 2006, the Roth 401(k) became available, which means after-tax contributions grow tax-free. Participants in employer-sponsored plans usually have the choice of which type of plan they want: traditional or Roth.</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/what-are-roth-401k-contribution-limits.asp\">401k tax deduction limit</a> for 2020 is $19,500. If you’re able to contribute this much, do so. You’ll save even more if your employer matches a percentage of your contributions. Many employers match dollar for dollar up to a capped amount, in many cases three percent of what the employee contributes. This matching contribution gives employees added incentive to contribute through a 401(k) even when they can’t max out contributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whichisbettertraditionalirarothiraor401k\">Which Is Better: Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or 401(k)?</h2>\n<p>As with most financial answers, choosing a tax-deferred retirement account depends on your situation and your desired outcomes. Because most employer plans offer some type of company matching for contributions and have higher limits, this is usually the best option. If you’re maxing out your 401(k) and still have money to save for retirement, you can then start to fund an IRA based on the contribution limits outlined above.</p>\n<p>As for whether the traditional or Roth contribution is better, it depends on your current and projected tax benefits. If the contribution and its deduction only saves you a few hundred dollars in taxes, maybe growing that money in a Roth IRA makes more sense.</p>\n<p>Talk with a financial advisor or tax professional to understand how a deduction will affect your budget.</p>\n<h2 id=\"retirementcontributionsandirsforms\">Retirement Contributions and IRS Forms</h2>\n<p>If you have an employer-sponsored 401k plan, you don’t need to worry about noting the deduction amount on your tax return. That appears on your W2.</p>\n<p>But if you make contributions to a traditional IRA, you want to note how much is being deducted. You also want to note when Roth contributions are made because the Roth must hold any contribution for at least five years to be eligible for tax-free status. To pull out your contributions (called your basis) before five years, you will need to note when that contribution was made. While contributions are noted by your IRA custodian (where your account is managed), some records might not follow the account if you decided to transfer an IRA to another company – say from a bank to an investment account.</p>\n<p>The following forms are the official records for tax returns that correspond to your IRA contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form 5498:</strong> Sent by IRA custodian to state how much was contributed.</li>\n<li><strong>Form 8606</strong>: Where you note non-deductible contributions to traditional and Roth IRAs, conversions, and distributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information on these forms is used on a Schedule 1 when filing tax returns Form 1040. The <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/f1040s1.pdf\">Schedule 1</a> then adjusts your income (lowers it) on line 8a of the Form 1040. While you may not turn in all forms with your tax return, keep them for your records if there is a question about the contribution date.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can use your <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/iras/articles/how-to-use-your-tax-refund-toward-retirement\">tax return to fund your IRA</a> prior to the tax deadline. So if you want to use $1,000 to contribute to your 2019 traditional IRA, you can take the deduction, get the return, and make the contribution. Just make sure you will get your refund before the filing deadline.</p>\n<p>Properly saving for retirement with the right deductions can open up some extra cash for <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">home improvements</a>, emergency funds, or just extra savings. Make sure you get all the <a href=\"/blog/smaller-property-tax-credit/\">deductions</a> you are entitled to. If you have questions about retirement contributions and getting the maximum deductions, talk to a tax professional.</p>"

    body: "<p>Let’s get straight to the point: you cannot deduct the premium you pay for your home insurance from your federal income tax returns.</p>\n<p>That can be frustrating, especially for new homeowners who may not have realized all of the additional costs that come with buying a home, like <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, repair bills, and property taxes. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Let’s take a closer look when home insurance is tax deductible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenishomeownersinsurancetaxdeductible\">When is homeowners insurance tax deductible?</h2>\n<p>Home insurance premiums usually aren’t tax deductible because most people buy homes for their personal use. But that means if your home is a business expense, then you may be able to deduct the cost of home insurance from your federal income tax.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may be able to deduct your homeowners insurance costs on your federal tax return if you bought the home as a rental property. A rental property is a business endeavor, so many of the expenses associated with maintaining the property are deductible. This typically includes homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>If you do have a rental property, make sure that you have the right type of home insurance. You want <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> and not a traditional homeowners policy. Sometimes called a rental dwelling policy, landlord insurance protects against the added risks that you face when you rent a property to others, including <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may be able to deduct a portion of your homeowners insurance payments if you run a business out of your home. The area you use as an office has to meet the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-small-business-owners-can-deduct-their-home-office-from-their-taxes\">criteria laid out by the Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) in order to qualify for a tax deduction. It must be</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Covered by your home insurance.</li>\n<li>Regularly and exclusively used for business purposes.</li>\n<li>Your business’ principal location.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"isprivatemortgageinsurancedeductible\">Is private mortgage insurance deductible?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">Private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) is a cost that you can deduct when filing your federal tax returns. It doesn’t matter if the property is your personal residence or a rental property – PMI is deductible in both cases.</p>\n<p>You should note that home insurance and PMI are two different things. The former protects you if your property is damaged. But PMI is coverage that protects your lender if you fail to make loan payments. Homeowners usually only have to get PMI if they can’t make a 20% down payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatareothernondeductiblehomeexpenses\">What are other non-deductible home expenses?</h2>\n<p>As you can see with homeowners insurance, not every expense associated with your home is deductible. Here are some common expenses most homeowners pay that aren’t deductible when it comes time to file your tax return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wages for housekeepers, gardeners, or other domestic workers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/hoa-fees/\">Homeowner associations fees</a> for a primary residence.</li>\n<li>Utility costs.</li>\n<li>Depreciation.</li>\n<li>Forfeited down payments or deposits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plan your budget to pay these necessary expenses, but don’t try to include them on your tax return’s itemized deduction list.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonhomeownersdeductions\">Common homeowners deductions</h2>\n<p>Home insurance may not be tax deductible, but there are still plenty of deductions that homeowners can look into. For example, you may want to talk to your tax preparer about the deductions available for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortgage interest.</strong> You can deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 of your mortgage debt for your primary home or a second home if you bought the house after December 16, 2017. For homes purchased between October 14, 1987 and December 15, 2017, the mortgage debt limit is $1 million.</li>\n<li><strong>Home equity loan interest.</strong> Interest on a home equity loan is typically deductible as long as you used the money to renovate your home. The amount of this loan counts towards the mortgage debt limit listed above.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical improvement expenses.</strong> Making upgrades for medical purposes, such as installing ramps or walk-in showers, may be deductible if you can show that someone in your household requires the accommodations.</li>\n<li><strong>Discount points.</strong> If you’ve purchased mortgage points, also called discount points, to reduce your mortgage interest, then you may be able to deduct the full amount from your federal taxes if you meet the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc504\">IRS criteria</a>. Note that discount points are not closing costs or loan origination points – those are not tax-deductible.</li>\n<li><strong>Property taxes.</strong> Those who are single or married and filing jointly can deduct up to $10,000 of property taxes. Those who are married filing separately can only deduct up to $5,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital gains.</strong> If you sell your home for a profit, you may owe capital gains taxes. However, married couples can claim up to $500,000 in capital gains exclusion and individuals can claim up to $250,000 if they lived in the house for at least two of the last five years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning about what is deductible and not deductible can help you better manage your home finances. While the homeowners insurance is not deductible, there are a lot of deductions that you can take advantage of to reduce the cost of home ownership.</p>"

    body: "<p>Mold can happen to anyone. And when it shows up in your home, it can lead to dangerous and unhealthy conditions, not to mention high clean-up costs.</p>\n<p>But does homeowners insurance cover mold? The answer to that question depends on what caused the mold – and your policy.</p>\n<p>The good news: many homeowners insurance policies cover mold damage, at least to a certain extent. Let’s look at how <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> covers mold and how you can minimize the risk of mold taking over your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenismoldcoveredbyhomeinsurance\">When Is Mold Covered by Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>For mold to be covered, it has to be the result of a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>. For example, let’s say a tree branch damages your roof and leads to a leak that causes water damage and subsequent mold growth. Most homeowners policies are likely to cover at least some of the mold damage in that scenario.</p>\n<p>Our policies have limited coverage for “fungi, mold, wet or dry rot, or bacteria,” which typically includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $10,000 of coverage for losses to your home or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>.</li>\n<li>Up to $50,000 of coverage for damage to a third party because of exposure to fungi, wet or dry rot, yeast, or bacteria (e.g., if a guest inhaled mold spores at your house and got sick as a result).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/environmental-safety/remove-mold-and-toxic-materials/\">average cost of mold remediation</a> in the United States is $2,245, with high-end jobs costing about $6,000. Note, however, costs can fluctuate by region. But generally, the coverage limits listed above should be adequate for typical mold remediation work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisntmoldcoveredbyhomeinsurance\">When Isn’t Mold Covered by Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Not all mold claims are covered by home insurance. That’s important to know because mold can pop up for a lot of reasons. For instance, mold usually isn't covered if it’s caused by an uncovered peril. Flood damage is a good example of this. External flooding is seldom covered by a homeowners policy, so mold caused by a flood is usually not covered.</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> might also deny coverage if the mold was caused by your negligence. If you have mold growing in your house because you ignored a leaky pipe, then your insurance company most likely won’t pay for mold remediation.</p>\n<p>And lastly, your insurance company usually doesn’t cover mold damage that was already in your home before you purchased your policy. Unfortunately, <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspections</a> don’t always check for mold, but you can ask an inspector if they see any obvious signs of water damage and the possibility of mold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"absolutemoldexclusionininsurancepolicies\">Absolute Mold Exclusion in Insurance Policies</h3>\n<p>Some insurance policies have an absolute mold exclusion. This means that no matter what caused the mold, the insurance company will not pay for the damages. These are rare in homeowners insurance, but you should find out if your policy has one.</p>\n<p>The best way to understand exactly when your home insurance covers mold remediation is to read your policy. But if the legalese gets to you, give us a call at 855-216-7674 and we’ll be happy to help!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatwaterdamagedoeshomeownersinsurancecover\">What Water Damage Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, homeowners insurance covers the sudden or accidental discharge of water in your home. That means most <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">home insurance covers water damage</a> from perils like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Burst pipes.</li>\n<li>Household appliances that malfunction or flood.</li>\n<li>Water that gets in because of a covered event (like a tree falling on your roof).</li>\n<li>Water damage caused by hail or wind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If water damage from these and similar events cause mold and your policy offers mold coverage, then your insurer may pay for mold remediation. But remember – home insurance seldom pays for damage from floodwaters. For that protection, you need <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>, which may offer coverage for mold caused by surging water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyouhaveamoldclaim\">What to Do If You Have a Mold Claim</h2>\n<p>Mold can form very quickly, so you want to act fast if you experience water damage. That means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shutting off the main water valve.</li>\n<li>Wiping up the water.</li>\n<li>Dehumidifying or drying out the area.</li>\n<li>Making any temporary repairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These steps help mitigate your damage, which is one of your duties as a policyholder.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to document your damage – including the mold. Make a list of every item that was damaged, and take pictures or videos of the mold and water damage. You may also want to create a timeline from when the loss happened to when the mold started growing and keep receipts for any temporary repairs. These are all things that can support your <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"/claims/\">file a claim</a> with your insurance company. Most insurance companies have a way to file claims online, but at the very least, you should be able to call your insurer’s claim department. Once you’ve filed, stay in contact with your insurance company to assist in its investigation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtotestformoldinyourhouse\">How to Test for Mold in Your House</h2>\n<p>The best thing to do if you suspect you have mold is to hire a professional to test. However, the site Family Handyman says you can <a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/how-to-test-for-mold/\">test for mold</a> by dipping a cotton swab in diluted bleach (one part bleach to 16 parts water) and dabbing it on the wall. If the spot grows lighter quickly or keeps coming back after cleaning, then it could be mold.</p>\n<p>Damp and humid areas are more prone to mold, so you check for growth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In bathrooms and shower rooms.</li>\n<li>Behind your refrigerator and below your sink.</li>\n<li>Beneath stacks of newspapers or cardboard.</li>\n<li>Behind drywall in spaces that contain plumbing lines.</li>\n<li>Behind the wallboard around leaking windows.</li>\n<li>In ventilation ducts.</li>\n<li>Under carpeting that was once wet.</li>\n<li>Behind acoustic ceiling tiles if your roof is leaked.</li>\n<li>Behind any drywall that has seen flooding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreventmoldinyourhouse\">How to Prevent Mold in Your House</h2>\n<p>The good news about mold is that prevention is largely a matter of standard home maintenance. You may be able to prevent mold in your house by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping your roof updated and watertight.</li>\n<li>Caulking cracks that could let water in.</li>\n<li>Updating windows and doors to prevent leaks.</li>\n<li>Maintaining plumbing and appliances that use water.</li>\n<li>Repairing damage when you see it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last point is important: mold damage is, in the beginning, mostly an aesthetic problem. But over time, it can weaken the infrastructure of your home and lead to serious damage or even injuries. So as with most <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist\">home maintenance projects</a>, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This content was originally published in August 2018 and has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>"

    body: "<p>This is one of the most common - and complicated - questions insurance agents hear, and unfortunately, it depends on your policy. Different types of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> cover pools differently, and some don’t cover them at all!</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeownersinsuranceappliestopools\">How homeowners insurance applies to pools</h2>\n<p>While pools are generally intended for fun and recreation, they can also be a tremendous liability if someone gets hurt. Aside from increasing your personal liability exposure, pools are also expensive to maintain and repair. While there’s no universal answer to whether pools are covered by insurance, it’s nearly always true that they’re expensive.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies are well aware of this. They take both the personal liability and structural liability into account when deciding whether to insure a home with a pool. Depending on your insurance company, your swimming pool may be classified as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part of your home’s structure, which is covered by <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>.</li>\n<li>An unattached structure, which falls under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a> in a home insurance policy.</li>\n<li>Personal property, which is covered by <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But this is only true for specific <a href=\"/blog/different-types-of-home-insurance/\">types of home insurance</a>. If you have an <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1</a>, HO2, or HO8, chances are your pool isn’t covered. However, if you have an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a> or HO5 homeowners policy, you may have coverage for your pool.</p>\n<p>Coverage options for the structure of your pool vary because each state has different weather patterns. Hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and earthquakes can affect pools differently, which is why it’s irresponsible to make blanket statements about coverage for home pools.</p>\n<p>You also want to know how your personal liability is covered if you have a pool. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability insurance</a> covers harm you cause other people and their property. Considering the increased risk for injury that comes with owning a pool, you’ll definitely want to dig into the specifics of this coverage.</p>\n<p>You should know that this personal liability coverage does not protect the pool itself, so it doesn’t pay to repair physical damage to either above-ground or in-ground pools. Moreover, <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> typically doesn’t cover applicants with slides or diving boards (this is also true for Kin).</p>\n<p>Again, each state and insurance company have different protocols.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeskinshomeinsurancecoverpools\">Does Kin’s home insurance cover pools?</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">home insurance does cover pools</a>, whether they are in-ground or above-ground pools. We cover in-ground pools as part of your dwelling coverage, or Coverage A, while the above-ground pools are considered an additional structure and fall under Coverage B.</p>\n<p>We do have a few requirements. For instance, your pool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can’t have a slide or diving board.</li>\n<li>Must have at least a four-foot fence with a locking gate surrounding it.</li>\n<li>Has to be filled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our policies also cover your liability in case there’s an accident in or around your pool. You should note, however, that leaks are usually only covered when they’re caused by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>, such as a fire or windstorm. Most leaks are the result of <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">wear and tear</a>, which is seldom covered by home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arepoolcagescoveredbyinsurance\">Are pool cages covered by insurance?</h2>\n<p>It depends. If damage is caused from something other than a hurricane, and the pool cage is attached to your home, then yes, it may be covered under your dwelling coverage. However, if there is a hurricane, many insurance companies (including Kin) exclude coverage for cages because they are not designed to withstand a hurricane.</p>\n<p>We know pool cages are expensive, so one option is to purchase a hurricane screen enclosure endorsement. This generally costs $100 per $10,000 of coverage and still requires the homeowner to pay a deductible. To keep expenses low in the event of a hurricane, consider a 1% <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>, if possible. This way there is less out-of-pocket expense in the event of serious hurricane damage.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you do have a pool, regardless of where you live, it’s worth considering extra personal liability coverage. Before you think you can’t afford it, here’s a little perspective: for every $100,000 of personal liability, premiums rise about $10 annually. That’s less than $1 per month to receive $100,000 extra coverage if someone is injured in and around your pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecostmorewithapool\">Does home insurance cost more with a pool?</h2>\n<p>Pools are considered <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a>, which is a term that describes things that seem like a lot of fun, but that also come with a ton of risk. Insurance companies have to account for that risk, as well as the possibility that damage might occur to the pool itself. Long story short? You may end up with a higher premium than you would if you didn’t have a pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpoolcracks\">Does homeowners insurance cover pool cracks?</h2>\n<p>Pool cracks may be covered if the cracks result from a peril already covered by your homeowners insurance policy. Some examples of common covered perils include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire.</li>\n<li>Windstorm</li>\n<li>Hail.</li>\n<li>Explosions.</li>\n<li>Theft.</li>\n<li>Vandalism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpoolcollapse\">Does homeowners insurance cover pool collapse?</h2>\n<p>Swimming pools can collapse for any number of reasons, such as a buildup of rain or ice, poor installation, or failing to make repairs. Unfortunately, these events are usually not covered by a homeowners policy. In fact, most home insurance doesn’t cover most pool collapses.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in December 2017.

    body: "<p>Folklore tells us that if March comes in like a lion, it goes out like a lamb. Unfortunately, March 2022 roared like a lion from beginning to end, with at least 210 confirmed tornadoes. That breaks the previous record of 192 in 2017.</p>\n<p>April probably won’t be much better. Experts predict anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/accuweather-2022-us-severe-weather-tornado-forecast/1151718\">200 to 275 tornadoes</a> next month and as many as 1,475 throughout the year. While record-breaking numbers like that are distressing, what may be even more unsettling is the change meteorologists have seen in both when and where tornadoes pop up. Historically, tornado season starts in March and lasts until June with states in Tornado Alley seeing the most activity. But scientists say the center of tornado activity actually appears to be <a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/research/features/stories/center-of-u-s-tornado-activity-shifting-east-and-south-possibly-due-to-climate-change\">more towards the south and east</a>.</p>\n<p>Is Tornado Alley shifting because of climate change or have scientists gotten better at spotting twisters? We take a look at what the latest research indicates to help you be better prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whereistornadoalley\">Where Is Tornado Alley?</h2>\n<p>There’s no hard and fast rule to say where <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley</a> actually is. The term was first used in 1952 as a title for a research project that focused on Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. As the term became more popular, the area it describes stretched to include states like Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Some add in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and even parts of eastern Colorado.</p>\n<p>Tornado Alley has a high risk for twisters because the area has flat, dry terrain that is often a meeting point for warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains. When these two types of air masses collide, the warm air rises and the cool air sinks. The result is severe thunderstorms with rotating winds, known as supercells. A funnel cloud may form if the winds in a supercell move at different speeds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isthereanewtornadoalley\">Is There a New Tornado Alley?</h2>\n<p>The data apparently supports the claims that Tornado Alley is shifting from its traditional location. For example, one <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2\">recent study</a> showed tornado frequency has increased in the Midwest and Southeast over the last four decades. Information compiled by USA Today also found that <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/06/17/how-expansion-tornado-alley-affect-more-southern-states/7689547002\">20 states experienced increased tornado activity</a> between the years 2000 and 2019 compared with 1980 and 1990.</p>\n<p>Many states outside of the traditional Tornado Alley boundaries saw a significant increase in tornado activity, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alabama, up 303 tornadoes.</li>\n<li>Mississippi, up 286 tornadoes.</li>\n<li>Kentucky, up 205 tornadoes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experts also think that tornado season also may be expanding. Tornado season unofficially starts in March and runs through June. However, the data compiled by USA Today show that recent years have seen more tornado swarms ﹘ outbreaks of 10 or more tornadoes from a single storm system ﹘ popping up both earlier and later in the season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"istornadoalleyshiftingbecauseofclimatechange\">Is Tornado Alley Shifting Because of Climate Change?</h2>\n<p>The jury is still out on whether the shift in tornado activity is due to climate change or not. Experts generally agree that there are more twisters in the southeastern states, but they <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/tornadoes-and-climate-change\">cannot directly link this to climate change</a>. Several studies have found that warming temperatures make the conditions that lead to severe thunderstorms more likely.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we may be seeing more tornadoes because of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better radar technology.</strong> Scientists can now identify storms that may produce tornadoes.</li>\n<li><strong>Population growth.</strong> More people in areas impacted by tornadoes means more eyewitness reports.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More research needs to be done to determine if there’s a direct link between tornadoes and climate change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreparefortornadoes\">How to Prepare for Tornadoes</h2>\n<p>Tornado Alley shifting towards the southeast puts more people at risk, but you can take steps to keep everyone safe. The first step is figuring out how likely tornadoes are in your area. You can do this with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s <a href=\"https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map\">National Risk Index</a>, an online tool that calculates your county’s risk for 18 natural hazards, including tornadoes.</p>\n<p>Next you need to learn the signs that a tornado is on the way. For example, you want to be on the lookout for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A greenish or dark sky.</li>\n<li>Large hail.</li>\n<li>A wall cloud, or a cloud that suddenly forms beneath the base of a cumulonimbus cloud.</li>\n<li>A funnel cloud, or a rotating column of condensed water droplets.</li>\n<li>A loud roar that sounds like a freight train.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note, however, that tornadoes aren’t always visible. They can be blocked by hills, trees, buildings, and even rain. That’s why it’s also important to pay attention to your local weather report and stay inside if the conditions are right for a tornado. Your community may also have an advanced emergency warning system. If you hear the siren, look for shelter.</p>\n<p>These and other <a href=\"/blog/tornado-safety-tips/\">tornado safety tips</a> can help you avoid harm if a tornado hits your area, but part of your preparation should also be a review of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most policies cover damage caused by wind storms like tornadoes, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to double check.</p>"

See how summer’s most popular events will affect your homeowners policy and what steps you should take (if any) to make sure you’re covered through the dog days and beyond.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swimming pools</strong>: If you already have a pool, you’ve likely already purchased a homeowners policy that offers coverage for any <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool-related liabilities</a> and property damage. But if you’re installing one this summer (in ground or above), make sure you let your insurance carrier know. Swimming pools introduce a whole new world of risk for you and your guests, so your insurance company will likely want to update your policy to accommodate the new structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Trampolines</strong>: Summer days spent jumping in the sun (or shade, depending on the weather) can make for great fun and great memories. But like swimming pools, trampolines come with unique risks. If you buy a trampoline this summer, call your insurance company. As with the swimming pool, they may have to update your policy to ensure that you’re covered in case something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Grills, barbecues, and fire pits</strong>: Whether you’re enjoying a small family meal or hosting a neighborhood blowout, outdoor cooking appliances come with a unique set of dangers. While most grills and grilling activity is covered by a standard homeowners policy, fire pits and freestanding barbecue structures may not be. The key is to check local laws and ordinances around fires. In fire-prone areas of the country, recreational burning is often banned or heavily restricted. In other areas, municipalities may require you to place or build fire pits a certain distance from your home or your neighbors’ property lines. Homeowners insurance policies won’t cover damage from illegal activities, so if fires are off-limits where you live, avoid them or risk losing coverage through your policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Home repairs</strong>: Summer is a great time to have external repairs and upgrades done to your property. But before you jump into a new project, make sure you’ve got adequate insurance protection. If you’re hiring contractors, verify their workers’ compensation and general liability insurance before they start work. Talk with your insurance provider to determine whether your existing <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">property coverage</a> will still function normally while work is being done on your home (coverage varies by policy). In some cases, you may want to take out a builder’s risk policy (or ask to be named as an additional insured on your contractor’s policy), which covers equipment, tools, and materials for building projects in progress. For minor updates like new shutters or paint, check that whoever does the work has active general liability and workers’ comp coverage. That way, if anything goes wrong, you’ll be able to collect financial compensation to cover your losses.</li>\n<li><strong>Traveling</strong>: For one- or two-week vacations, your standard homeowners insurance policy covers you. But if you’re planning to be gone for more than 30 or 60 days (depending on your policy), you may be required to carry vacant home insurance on top of your normal homeowners policy. This is because a vacant house is more susceptible to certain risks (theft, vandalism, etc.) and insurance companies want to make sure they’re calculating the risk properly. If you don’t feel like getting more insurance (trust us, we don’t blame you), consider hiring a homesitter you can trust to maintain your property for the duration of your trip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s plenty to love about the warmest season of the year. But before you transition to full “living is easy” mode, verify that your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> is ready to protect you no matter how you plan to enjoy the season.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you live in Florida or Louisiana, you already know that finding affordable home insurance used to be a chore. These are the two <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">top-priced home insurance markets</a> in the country with annual premiums averaging $1,951 and $1,968, respectively. Unfortunately, more severe storms and <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">rising materials costs</a> mean insurance premiums will continue to climb in the near term.</p>\n<p>Making homeowners insurance affordable is one of our primary goals, so we regularly survey our customers to see how we're doing. Here's what our Q2 survey revealed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdocustomerssaveonaveragewithkin\">How Much Do Customers Save on Average with Kin?</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey/\">survey last year</a> showed customers save approximately $600 on average when they switch to Kin. Take a look at the savings based on the type of policy that new Kin customers purchased. That’s a substantial amount of savings, especially when you consider that most of our customers are in high-risk zones for natural disasters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagekincustomersavingsbypolicy\">Average Kin Customer Savings by Policy</h3>\n<p>| Policy Type | Average Savings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Homeowners | $616 |\n| Condominium | $438 |\n| Mobile Home | $620 |</p>\n<p>Kin customers who own condominiums don’t save quite as much as home and mobile homeowners do. That’s because <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> is generally much cheaper than the other products because it doesn't usually cover the building's exterior –&nbsp;typically, the HOA is responsible for insuring that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdofloridahomeownerssaveonaveragewithkin\">How Much Do Florida Homeowners Save on Average with Kin?</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at Florida. The most recent data puts the average annual home insurance premium in the Sunshine State at $1,951. Kin homeowners insurance customers report an average savings of $676.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagekinfloridacustomersavingsbypolicy\">Average Kin Florida Customer Savings by Policy</h3>\n<p>| Policy Type | Average Savings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Homeowners | $676 |\n| Condo | $429 |\n| Rental Dwelling | $562 |\n| Mobile Home | $597 |</p>\n<p>We’ve only been <a href=\"/blog/hi-louisiana/\">writing policies in Louisiana since</a> March 2021, so we didn’t have a large enough data pool to provide detailed information about savings. That said, our Louisiana customers report savings of $698 per year on homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownerschoosekin\">Why Do Homeowners Choose Kin?</h2>\n<p>We also wanted to find out if price is the only reason people made the move to Kin. Otherwise, how can we know if we’re providing the best insurance experience possible? So we asked customers to rank their reasons for choosing Kin between four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better price.</li>\n<li>Better customer service.</li>\n<li>Ease of use.</li>\n<li>Other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More than 60 percent of new customers came because we offered a better price. Another 16 percent came for improved customer service, and eight percent chose us for our ease of use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/why-kin.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This is the second year that our Customer Savings Survey showed that better prices drew most new customers our way. But it is the first time that cost far outstripped both better customer service and ease of use﹘although together, those accounted for nearly a quarter of are new customers. Ultimately, these responses indicated that we’re offering a simple process with exceptional service all for the best possible price.</p>\n<p>How do we achieve this? We’ve cut out extra costs like independent agents and brick-and-mortar locations. By completely digitizing the product and process, we’ve been able to make a better experience that saves customers money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wouldhomeownersrecommendkintoafriend\">Would Homeowners Recommend Kin to a Friend?</h2>\n<p>The better experience customers get with Kin is also evident in our Net Promoter Score (NPS). It’s a metric that looks at a company’s customer experience and is useful in predicting business growth. Essentially, the NPS says whether customers will recommend a service to a friend.</p>\n<p>The average NPS in the insurance industry is 42, and most of our direct competitors’ NPS is in the 40s and 50s. Our NPS is 85, nearly 10 points higher than the next best, USAA. This tells us that our customers are big fans who are ready and willing to share their positive experience with friends and family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"netpromoterscoresforhomeownersinsurancecompanies\">Net Promoter Scores for Homeowners Insurance Companies</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2021-nps.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thetakeaway\">The Takeaway</h2>\n<p>As you can probably tell, we’re excited about our survey results. They mean we’re fulfilling our promises and that is important to us. But it’s probably even more important to note that people who may otherwise struggle to find home insurance are getting coverage that makes homeownership possible.</p>\n<p>If you want to see what real customers have to say about us, check out the more than <a href=\"/reviews/\">1,700 reviews on Trustpilot</a>. You can see for yourself why we have an 89 percent five-star rating and read exactly what customers are talking about.</p>"

    body: "<p>Kin is officially a home insurance carrier in Florida, and we are on a mission to wow you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whythekincarrierisgoodforflorida\">Why the Kin Carrier Is Good for Florida</h2>\n<p>You may have seen our <a href=\"https://medium.com/kin-insurance/why-we-launched-an-insurance-carrier-a-letter-from-kins-ceo-180b6b33da78\">recent announcement</a>: we’ve launched a home insurance carrier. Now in addition to selling homeowners insurance to Florida homeowners, we can actually underwrite <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policies.</p>\n<p>So what does that mean for you? If you live in Florida, it means three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Even better customer experience</strong>: Now that we have control over the entire life of the policy, we don’t have to adjust our offerings based on any other company’s changing standards or policies. That means we can make every decision based on the best interests of our customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Resources where you need them</strong>: We founded Kin to make homeowners insurance more accessible to Gulf Coast residents and others who face unusually high risks. As a carrier, we’ll work to make better and better products available to the people who need them most.</li>\n<li><strong>Constant innovation</strong>: We built Kin to provide easy, affordable homeowners insurance coupled with world-class customer service. We’ve been able to deliver on both of those thanks to our tech-first approach. As a carrier, we’ll continue to innovate to offer more products and services to keep Florida homeowners safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s break it down in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morecontrolbettercustomerexperience\">More Control = Better Customer Experience</h2>\n<p>Until now, we’ve been able to sell homeowners insurance policies but we weren’t actually underwriting them ourselves. That means that we had to play by the rules of the carriers we worked with, following their guidelines for who could get a policy under what circumstances and (crucially) how much they would have to pay for it.</p>\n<p>Becoming a carrier means we’re now the ones with control and oversight of the entire life of your policy. We aren't beholden to another company's underwriting or sudden restrictions. We can truly put your best interests first in every decision we make.</p>\n<p>Because we own the customer experience from start to finish for Florida policyholders, we can make sure you get clear, straightforward answers about your policy or your claims process. Even better, we’ll use the same tech-forward, data-driven approach to damage assessment and claims processing as we do to generate insurance quotes.</p>\n<p>Interested in getting a homeowners insurance quote from us? If you own a home in Florida, you can get a quote from the Kin Interinsurance Network. Just call us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>\n<p>And as always, if you need to meet with an adjuster or have questions about documenting a loss, our team is available to help. And if you have any questions about the claims process or how to file, you can visit our online <a href=\"/claims/\">Claims Center</a>. You’re welcome to call or email claims questions to our team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resourcesforcoastalhomeowners\">Resources for Coastal Homeowners</h2>\n<p>From day one, it’s been our goal to serve customers who need it most – coastal homeowners impacted by climate change. Since we launched in 2016, we’ve grown to become an insurance provider in states including Alabama, Georgia, <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a>, and Florida.</p>\n<p>Our emphasis on homeowners insurance in the Gulf Coast is no accident. A significant portion of the Gulf Coast region lies <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3047/\">below 30 meters in elevation</a>, including most of the southern tip of Florida. These low-lying areas are particularly vulnerable to tropical storms, hurricanes, and seasonal flooding.</p>\n<p>We understand that homeowners in this region are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and population growth in the area means that this problem will only grow in the coming decade.</p>\n<p>Why? Because in Florida, the population is projected to grow from <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Florida.pdf\">20.7 million to 27.7 million</a> by 2040. Of that group, Floridians 60 and older will grow in numbers from 11.3 million to 13.1 million – a significant increase in the number of folks looking for a sunny retirement in a region that’s acutely vulnerable to flooding and other major catastrophes.</p>\n<p>For seniors, many of whom live on a fixed income, having an insurance provider who is there for them and able to provide affordable, comprehensive coverage is important. That’s why we at Kin continue to focus on proactive outreach so we can ensure Florida residence have dependable coverage before and after storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constantinsuranceinnovation\">Constant Insurance Innovation</h2>\n<p>Being a carrier means we can move fast to innovate and develop new products. We use tech to make that happen, both behind the scenes and in ways customers can see.</p>\n<p><strong>For example</strong>: When Hurricane Irma blanketed Florida in 2017, Kin’s team was able to build a new process to check in with customers before the storm was over to make sure everyone was okay and that they had the support they needed. We try to <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">move fast and fix things</a> whenever we see the opportunity, and our customer support team is proof of that.</p>\n<p>After the storms, we were able to connect with customers via text message to capture photos of damaged property and determine where sending small drones to collect photographic evidence would be helpful. Our tech-forward approach to data collection and problem solving helped us serve our customers faster, and gave us plenty of insight into how to tackle issues that may arise in the next big storm.</p>\n<p>As an insurance carrier, we’re now able to think even more creatively about what information and variables will help us help customers more efficiently. As an agile startup, we’re able to pivot and innovate on the fly, and we’re excited to expand our troubleshooting and problem-solving capacity.</p>\n<p>Homeowners in catastrophe-prone regions need more support; we have the technology and the team to offer that support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"letkinhandlethat\">Let Kin Handle That</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to bring more affordable homeowners insurance to Florida, especially as the region’s risks escalate with climate change.</p>\n<p>Becoming an insurance carrier that provides excellent <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is a way of solidifying our dedication to the Gulf Coast, and we’re proud to help protect the property of homeowners in this region.</p>\n<p>See if we’re a good fit for your home. Call us for a quote today at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>!</p>"

    body: "<p>“What do our members need?”</p>\n<p>We ask ourselves that question a lot around the Kin offices, whether we’re helping homeowners understand their coverage or building a system to deliver quick insurance quotes. The question is important to us because the answers inform just about every decision we make. Putting customers first is just what we do.</p>\n<p>Our member-centric approach matters most when things are at their worst – and it doesn’t get much worse than the day you have a hurricane barreling down on your home.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we had been asking ourselves about our customers' needs long before Hurricanes Ian and Nicole hit the Sunshine State. Our answers let us put together a game plan to help members before, during, and after the storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kinscatastropheresponse\">Kin’s catastrophe response</h2>\n<p>But Kin is also made up of people – our Kinfolk! – who care deeply about our members, especially when those members are facing a catastrophe. So between thinking about what our customers’ needs and having the technology to meet them, we came up with a strategy to keep homeowners safe. It included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overlaying real-time weather updates from the National Hurricane Center on our policies to identify which homes were in the storm’s path.</li>\n<li>Alerting members who may have been impacted by the storm three days before landfall so they could gather supplies and secure their homes.</li>\n<li>Checking in on members after the hurricane to see if they were okay and if they needed to file a claim.</li>\n<li>Using aerial imagery to scan <strong>40,000 properties</strong> for damage to jumpstart the claims process and tell members who had been evacuated about the condition of their homes.</li>\n<li>Mobilizing a cross-company effort to contact members who filed claims, allowing us to check in on their well-being and get the claims process started as efficiently as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a good thing we had a plan in place, too. In just one week, we were hit with as many claims as we had for the entire preceding year. Despite the overwhelming number of claims, our team ended up beating the industry averages. The <a href=\"https://www.floir.com/home/ian\">Florida Office of Insurance Regulation</a> says we have a higher claims closure rate (78%) and a lower claims open without payment rate (10.2%) compared to our competitors.</p>\n<p>We’re proud of the work we did during the 2022 hurricane season. None of it was easy, but we truly feel that we made a difference for many of our members, or at least the 7,944 who filed claims so far – an increase of nearly <a href=\"/news/kin-insurance-provides-hurricane-ian-update/\">17% from our prior update</a>.</p>\n<p>Making sure our members have the money they need to rebuild is a big part of our catastrophe response, but it isn’t the only way we helped them. After Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, several of our Kinfolk also put in long days staffing Florida’s <a href=\"/hurricane-ian-assistance/\">insurance village</a> to assist customers who had lost internet or phone service. Whether these employees spent that time helping a homeowner navigate a claim, issuing a check for <a href=\"/blog/additional-living-expenses-examples/\">additional living expenses</a>, answering questions about the claims process, or simply sitting by someone's side and listening to their story, they showed that our highest priority is taking care of our members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ourmembersaretalking\">Our members are talking</h2>\n<p>What really makes our efforts worthwhile, however, is hearing how our members feel about their experience with Kin. This was especially true in the days following Hurricane Ian.</p>\n<p>Many of our representatives were working long hours trying to contact members who had initiated claims. You can imagine how tired and stressed out our members were in that situation, so hearing positive comments from them meant the world to our team. Many of our homeowners told us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They never had an insurance company care until now.</li>\n<li>Our team members are prompt, professional, and kind.</li>\n<li>They appreciated Kin checking in on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can take a look at more of our <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> to get a better idea of the kind of feedback we’ve earned over the years.</p>\n<p>We get it, finding affordable homeowners insurance is incredibly tough right now, and storms like Ian and Nicole only exacerbate the problems that push <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida home insurance rates skyward.</a> But we're doing everything we can to provide members with affordable coverage and, when disaster strikes, marshaling all our strength to support people in their time of need.</p>\n<p>Like we always say, we’re a different kind of insurance company. So we’re going to keep looking for ways to improve by putting you, our members, first.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2022.</em></p>"

    body: "<p>You can learn a lot from the past. What can you learn from how insurance used to be?</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.” -James Baldwin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s always fun to take a stroll down memory lane, whether it’s looking at old childhood photos, going to a local museum or reading a good historical novel. History indeed reveals the past but can often be a predicator of the future. The best part about history is the continual discovery of hidden gems; much can be learned from seemingly innocuous things that implode with fascination upon exploration.</p>\n<p>Take homeowners insurance for instance. What could possibly be fun and enlightening about paying for something you may never actually use that requires an arduous application and claims process due to outdated systemic protocols? Well, the truth is, the insurance industry wasn’t always stigmatized as malevolent and filled with corporate greed. In fact, the concept of homeowners insurance transpired out of the Great London Fire in 1666. This unprecedented blaze destroyed over 13,000 homes, and it’s estimated over 70,000 of London’s then 80,000 homes endured damage as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/dwelling-insurance.jpg?width=2221&name=dwelling-insurance.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In such, fire insurance was born and essentially paved the way to <a href=\"/blog/the-history-of-homeowners-insurance-in-america/\">present day homeowners insurance</a>. Fires were rather common because wood was the primary material to build homes and people used gasoline stoves and candles to make light. This equaled an inevitable recipe for disaster. Our ancestors’ started off by isolating just one peril, fire, and then slowly began to offer various other forms of insurance protection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/insurance-from-1800s-gas-stove-permit.jpg?width=2448&name=insurance-from-1800s-gas-stove-permit.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1732, fire insurance was introduced to the United States but didn’t really garner popularity until the next century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatdidatypicalpolicylooklikeinthe1800s\">What did a typical policy look like in the 1800's?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/insurance-policy-from-1800s.jpg?width=2448&name=insurance-policy-from-1800s.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Actual insurance policy from 1849 with $500 worth of fire coverage for a $40 premium with a policy duration of 5 years.</p>\n<p>For $5 in 1849 an individual could get a $500 fire policy. Prices in 2017 are 2985.4% higher than prices in 1849, so $5 is equivalent to $154.27 and $500 is equivalent to $15,426.78. That doesn't sound too bad at first glance, however, many insurance companies at the time did not insure up to the full cash value and only offered a percentage of the value of the property. This was only for the structure of the home as well. Again, as history progressed, more and more types of policies were added on such as for furniture (which predates today's personal property coverage), gas stove permits, electric light permits, lightning, and marine coverage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/insurance-policy-from-the-1800s.jpg?width=1631&name=insurance-policy-from-the-1800s.jpg\" alt=\"\" />This is an actual handwritten insurance policy from 1849</p>\n<p>To give a little context, the average worker in the mid 1800’s earned about $1-$2 a day. Work back then was very different than today; folks didn’t go to the same place, punch in and work 40hrs a week. Things were very sporadic and unpredictable. In such, the average person earned $10-$20 a month. In 2017 standards, that’s about $30-$60 a day or $595-$620 a month. Back then folks were paying about a week or two’s worth of salary on fire insurance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/laborers-1800s_153899975.jpg?width=2400&name=laborers-1800s_153899975.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In 2017, the average cost of a homeowner’s insurance policy nationally was $1,082. The average income for a single person according to the most recent US Census data in 2014 was $34,940. Since women did not work in the 1800’s the fairest comparison is with a single today. So essentially, the same applies over 150 years later, a homeowner’s insurance premium is still about 1-2 week’s salary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sowhatdidahousecostinthe1800s\">So what did a house cost in the 1800s?</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/1870CatalogueofGoods.pdf\">National Park Service</a>, in 1870 land cost $5/acre (avg. 160 acres) a 4 ROOM house was 32’x40’ and cost $700, a TWO room house was 16'x22' and cost $300, and a shanty 8'x10' (1room/dirt floor) was $25. Remember, a $5 premium could garner $500 worth of fire coverage but didn't necessarily cover the full replacement. The most challenging thing plaguing consumers at the time was the claims process. The industry was essentially self regulating with very little governmental intervention. Folks were getting scammed and so were the insurance agencies. Arson was a very big problem as everyone was looking for a payout. Many insurance companies were not able to pay out claims as they had inadequate funds, just like a present day Ponzi scheme.</p>\n<p>The main take away from looking back upon the history books is to see how society has evolved and get an understanding of the complexities and unpleasantries of the homeowners insurance industry in general. Many people were severely burned durning that time by unscrupulous practices paving the way for increased governmental oversight on both the federal and state levels. Consumer protectionism, customized policies, and comprehensive polices were nonexistent at the time.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies have historically had immense leverage in society and perceived as a necessary evil. Without homeowners insurance all the homes effected by <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, earthquakes, fires and any other devastating act would remain in ruins, cities would be destroyed, states and countries would be a lot worse off.</p>"

    body: "<p>Homeowners insurance in Louisiana is some of the most expensive in the nation. In fact, the Insurance Information Institute puts the average premium at $2,037 per year, earning the Pelican State the number one spot for home insurance costs. If that wasn’t enough to cause alarm, then recent reports Louisiana homeowners insurance rate increases certainly may.</p>\n<p>Why are insurance rates so high in Louisiana? And why are they going up? Here are three key factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High reinsurance costs.</li>\n<li>Record-breaking hurricane seasons in 2020 and 2021.</li>\n<li>Inflation’s impact on repair costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any one of these factors could make getting affordable <a href=\"http://kin.com/home-insurance/louisiana/\">home insurance in Louisiana</a> difficult. But all three hitting at roughly the same time explains why many believe the state is in the middle of an insurance crisis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reinsurancecostsincreasing\">Reinsurance costs increasing</h2>\n<p>Most experts agree that high reinsurance costs are driving Louisiana homeowners insurance rate increases. <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">Reinsurance</a> is often described as “insurance for insurance companies.” Much like you transfer some of your risk to an insurer by buying its <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">policy</a>, an insurance company transfers some of the risk it takes on by getting reinsurance.</p>\n<p>Reinsurance is essential for any company that wants to offer <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> in catastrophe-prone areas like Louisiana. Unfortunately, changing weather patterns have increased the frequency and severity of storms, and that has resulted in more expensive claims. That, in turn, causes reinsurers to charge higher premiums that insurance companies have to pay if they want to continue to offer coverage to homeowners in Louisiana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recordbreakinghurricaneseasons\">Record-breaking hurricane seasons</h2>\n<p>Closely tied to the rising cost of reinsurance are the Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2020 and 2021 when Louisiana was hit by four hurricanes, each a Category 2 or higher. Altogether, these four storms were responsible for nearly <a href=\"https://www.katc.com/news/the-cost-of-coverage-a-look-at-the-state-of-insurance-in-louisiana\">$22 billion in insurance claims</a> in the state.</p>\n<p>| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hurricane | Category | Louisiana insurance claims cost |\n| Laura | Category 4 | $9.1 billion |\n| Delta | Category 2 | $875.5 million |\n| Ida | Category 4 | $10.9 billion |\n| Zeta | Category 3 | $629.3 million |</p>\n<p>These two record-breaking hurricane seasons may have been enough to make reinsurers rethink what they charge for their coverage. But reinsurance is a global industry, so catastrophic losses in other parts of the world also affect reinsurance premiums. Sadly, the <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/weather-related-disasters-increase-over-past-50-years-causing-more-damage-fewer\">number of billion-dollar disasters has increased fivefold</a> in the last 50 years, due in large part to climate change.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering why rate increases are a problem in Louisiana now rather than two years ago. In part, it’s because both insurance companies and the reinsurers they work with set their rates based on predictions made using historical data. Information from the storm only recently impacted that data.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> What we’re discussing here are rates insurers file with state regulators, not individual premiums. Large numbers of <a href=\"/faq/catastrophe/\">catastrophe claims</a> occurring more frequently often means higher reinsurance costs for your insurance company, which then files for a rate increase. That rate is then applied to all policies. Other traits, like location and home value, are factored in to come up with your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inflationsimpactonrepaircosts\">Inflation’s impact on repair costs</h2>\n<p>All insurance companies have to price policies so they have enough money in the bank to cover their policyholders’ claims. However, the amount of money it takes to repair a home isn’t set in stone. Inflation can significantly affect construction costs – as we saw when <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber prices skyrocketed in 2021</a> – and that often means insurers raise rates so they can meet their obligations.</p>\n<p>Luckily, inflation appears to be easing, which is good for construction costs. Veririsk’s <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/360value-quarterly-reconstruction-cost-analysis-q2-2023.pdf\">Reconstruction Cost Analysis</a> shows costs increased just 3.1% between April 2022 and April 2023. That’s down from the 6.8% increase from January 2022 to January 2023.</p>\n<p>What’s a little less lucky is that insurance companies have to decide their rates based on past information. Essentially, insurers can’t adjust their rates for decreasing costs until it appears in their data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areinsurancecompaniespullingoutoflouisiana\">Are insurance companies pulling out of Louisiana?</h2>\n<p>Another sign that there’s trouble brewing in the Louisiana home insurance market is the number of insurance companies pulling out of the state. As of early February 2023, over <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/business/here-are-the-louisiana-insurers-that-have-gone-broke-or-left-the-state-amid-deepening/article_c7f077b4-3e98-11ed-86c9-f7f11037202f.html\">20 insurance companies</a> have either gone insolvent or withdrawn from Louisiana, including well-known insurers like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Southern Fidelity Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Fednat Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Bankers Speciality Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>United Property &amp; Insurance Company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less competition is seldom good for prices, but fewer companies willing to sell homeowners policies has forced many to turn to Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation. Operating as a public-private partnership, Louisiana Citizens is considered an insurer of last resort – there to cover people who can’t get insured in the private market.</p>\n<p>But the coverage from Louisiana Citizens isn’t cheap. State law requires its rates be 10% higher than the highest private insurer in each parish, and the Louisiana Department of Insurance (LDI) recently approved the company’s request for a <a href=\"https://www.ldi.la.gov/news/press-releases/10-10-22-ldi-approves-citizens-rate-increase-and-offers-tips-for-policyholders\">63% rate increase</a> on residential properties.</p>\n<p>Cost may be the immediate concern for Louisiana homeowners, but risk exposure should be as well. Louisiana Citizens now covers over <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/investigations/david-hammer/louisianas-insurance-crisis-what-can-fix-it/289-a9fe2f3c-8701-4f75-959f-6ec7b5e7f380\">100,000 policyholders</a>. That’s a lot of potential claims should the state see another record-breaking hurricane season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsbeingdoneaboutlouisianahomeownersinsurancerateincreases\">What’s being done about Louisiana homeowners insurance rate increases?</h2>\n<p>The first steps towards heading off an insurance crisis were taken in February when the LDI funded the Insure Louisiana Incentive Program. This program encourages insurance companies to take part in Louisiana’s voluntary home insurance market by offering matching grants to write new policies in the state.</p>\n<p>In April, the <a href=\"https://www.ldi.la.gov/news/press-releases/4-3-23-ldi-unveils-comprehensive-market-reforms-to-strengthen-housing-stock-and-stabilize-market\">LDI announced insurance market reforms </a>geared in part towards stabilizing home insurance rates. Central to the reforms is the Louisiana Fortify Homes Program that encourages homeowners to strengthen their roofs against hurricane wind damage for premium discounts. Additionally, the LDI has proposed legal and claim process reforms in the hope of attracting more insurers to the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcanlouisianahomeownersdotoreduceinsurancecosts\">What can Louisiana homeowners do to reduce insurance costs?</h2>\n<p>Any reform the LDI proposes will likely take some time to create the change Louisianan homeowners are looking for. In the meantime, you can take steps to <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-hardening-tips/\">harden your home</a> against risk by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retrofitting your home so it complies with the State Uniform Construction Code.</li>\n<li>Installing hurricane shutters and impact-resistant windows and garage doors.</li>\n<li>Investing in fire alarms, security systems, and water monitoring devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also be able to lower your premium by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asking about discounts.</strong> Insurance companies often use premium credits and discounts to encourage behaviors that reduce risks or minimize their costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Raising your deductible.</strong> A higher deductible often translates into a lower premium, but only choose an amount you know you can pay even in a catastrophe.</li>\n<li><strong>Comparing rates.</strong> Every insurance company has its own method for determining rates, so premiums can vary quite a bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do decide to shop around for a new policy, be sure to look at more than just the premium. Take a look at the coverage amounts, deductibles, and other policy information so you can decide if you’re getting your money’s worth.

    body: "<p>Louisiana is no stranger to hurricanes and storm damage. In 2020 alone, private insurers in Louisiana paid <strong>$4.5 billion</strong> for 101,000 storm-related claims. The state trails only Florida for most single-family homes at risk for a Category 5 hurricane: Louisiana has 843,349 at-risk homes; Florida has 2,851,642.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/lahur.pdf\">NOAA</a>, one hurricane will make landfall in Louisiana every 2.8 years. Understanding Louisiana’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane</a> history, storm patterns, and damage can help residents better prepare for the weather. Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianasbiggesthurricanes\">Louisiana’s Biggest Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>Louisiana’s biggest and most devastating hurricane in recent years was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm caused more than $125 billion in damages and claimed the lives of more than 1,570 Louisiana residents. Entire urban communities were submerged in more than 10 feet of water. New Orleans still hasn’t fully recovered. The storm displaced more than 1 million people at its peak. Recent estimates say <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/hurricane-katrina\">more than 400,000 people have been permanently displaced</a> by the storm. Hurricane Katrina’s legacy is still felt throughout the state.</p>\n<p>Not every storm hits Louisiana with the same intensity, though seven hurricanes in recent history have reached a similar windspeed. Take a look at the chart below.</p>\n<p>| Storm Name | Year | Max Windspeed |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Audrey | 1957 | 177 mph |\n| Betsy | 1965 | 130 mph |\n| Camille | 1969 | 190 mph |\n| Andrew | 1992 | 141 mph |\n| Katrina | 2005 | 175 mph |\n| Rita | 2005 | 175 mph |\n| Ike | 2008 | 110 mph |</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianascostliesthurricanes\">Louisiana’s Costliest Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>The damage a hurricane can cause is twofold. First, the intense wind speeds can cause damage on their own, blowing debris at such velocity that they act as projectiles. Wind can be strong enough to rip roofs off homes, blow down trees, break windows, upend cars, and more. Second, heavy rains and storm surges almost always accompany hurricanes. As we touched on with Katrina, that amount of rain and flooding can submerge entire communities.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to fortify your Louisiana home. <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Strong roofs</a>, <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a>, and adequate <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can make a world of difference when you need to recover from a major storm.</p>\n<p>These are the hurricanes that have caused the most damage in Louisiana to date.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/louisiana-costliest-hurricanes.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>| Storm | Cost of Damages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Betsy | $1.42 billion |\n| Camille | $1.42 billion |\n| Andrew | $25 billion |\n| Katrina | $125 billion |\n| Rita | $10.5 billion |\n| Ike | $34.8 billion |</p>\n<h2 id=\"costliesthurricaneinushistoryhurricanekatrina\">Costliest Hurricane in US History: Hurricane Katrina</h2>\n<p>Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005. It’s obvious from our data that Hurricane Katrina was costlier than the next worst hurricane by multiples. With more than $125 billion in damages across Louisiana and more than $161 billion in damages throughout the Gulf Coast, Katrina cost nearly four times more than Hurricane Ike.</p>\n<p>Here are some key statistics about Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p>| --- | --- |\n| Hurricane Katrina (at landfall) | Category 3 |\n| Max Winds | 175 mph |\n| Highest Storm Surge | 11.45 feet |\n| Louisiana Fatalities | 1,577 |\n| Damaged Homes | 850,000 |\n| Destroyed Vehicles | 350,000 |\n| Destroyed Ships and Boat Vessels | 2,400 |</p>\n<p>Hurricane Katrina showed just how vulnerable even urban cities were to a major storm. People fled by foot on freeway overpasses or made their way to rooftops to await rescue. Many who fled hard-hit areas like New Orleans have yet to return.</p>\n<p>Because many areas around New Orleans were not classified as FEMA flood zones, many residents were not required to have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. The levee, which failed during the storm, also gave a false sense of security for the community.</p>\n<p>In fact, even after Katrina, nearly <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/fourteen-years-later-new-orleans-is-still-trying-to-recover-from-hurricane-katrina\">53 percent</a> of the city’s properties are still classified as non-risk flood zones even though these exact areas saw nearly 12 feet of floodwater during the storm.</p>\n<p>It’s a good reminder that flood insurance is a necessary safeguard, especially in Louisiana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoeslouisianaexperiencesomanyhurricanes\">Why Does Louisiana Experience So Many Hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Louisiana’s position along the Gulf of Mexico makes the state especially susceptible to hurricanes. The Gulf is ideal for the formation of hurricanes each year because of its warm water and its location. Hurricanes in the northern hemisphere form at tropical and subtropical regions and move toward the East Coast. The Gulf’s warm water creates the perfect conditions for hurricanes to form. The water must be at least <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-hurricanes-hit-the-east-coast-of-the-u-s-but-never-the-west-coast/\">80 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain a hurricane</a>, and the Gulf is regularly 83 degrees in summer months.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/storms/how-hurricanes-form\">hurricane is formed</a> as warm moisture rises above the water and cools at higher altitudes in zones of low pressure. This starts the formation of clouds which will begin to rotate in alignment with the Earth’s rotation to create an organized pressure system. With more warm water, the storm clouds and speeds grow. Wind speeds need to reach at least 74 miles per hour for the system to become a hurricane.</p>\n<p>For Louisiana, hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30 each year. At least <a href=\"https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/07/29/breakdown-why-more-hurricanes-form-gulf-coast-august/\">three named storms</a> happen in August alone each year. Both Hurricane Andrew and Katrina were August storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"climatechangeandthefutureoflouisianahurricanes\">Climate Change and the Future of Louisiana Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>The entire planet is feeling the <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">effects of climate change</a> and global warming, and Louisiana is no exception. The state is warmer and rising waters threaten low-lying properties with flooding. Soil is drier, but there’s an increase in annual rainfall, most of which happens in heavy downpours. Tropical storms and hurricanes are becoming more frequent and more intense.</p>\n<p>Higher sea levels is a major concern. Grand Isle, Louisiana, measured one of the three highest rates of sea-level rise in 2019. The area rose 7.93 millimeters for the year, higher than both Rockport and Galveston where the other notable levels were recorded. At this rate, the water levels in the area could be <a href=\"https://texasclimatenews.org/tcn-journal/new-study-confirms-gulf-coast-sea-level-rise-among-the-countrys-highest/\">1.77 feet higher by 2050</a>.</p>\n<p>The water is getting warmer, too. Seawater is holding more heat from greenhouse gases. During summer months, the Grand Isle water temperature averages 83 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. But climate data suggests that water is heating up at an average rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Water farther offshore where drilling occurs measured temperatures <a href=\"https://time.com/5824299/ocean-temperature-rise-climate-change/\">1.7 degrees Fahrenheit higher</a> than normal in 2020.</p>\n<p>This means more warm water to fuel intense hurricanes.</p>\n<p>In other words, Louisiana residents need to be more prepared for the next storm because the risk of damage and flooding grows by the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learningfromlouisianashurricanehistory\">Learning from Louisiana’s Hurricane History</h2>\n<p>The hurricanes of the past can help us predict and brace for worse storms in the future. That means fortifying your home for hurricane and <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">flood risks</a> and making sure your insurance can protect you.</p>\n<p>Take a lesson from Katrina: even if you’re not in a high-risk flood zone, your area can still flood. Don’t take a chance on your life’s biggest investment. Learn about the flood protection with rates as low as $175 per year.</p>"

    body: "<p>Save money on insurance and spruce up your house. Win-win.</p>\n<p>While we all want to find the lowest homeowners insurance rates possible, it’s important to remember that the very <em>lowest</em> rates may not come with the best coverage. So consider this our disclaimer: we’re all about <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">saving money on insurance</a>, but as you pursue lower rates, be sure to read the fine print to make sure you’re getting adequate protection.</p>\n<p>Now to the good stuff.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for the lowest homeowners insurance rates <em>within reason</em> (i.e., the lowest rates that still offer <a href=\"/blog/find-low-cost-home-insurance/\">solid coverage</a> and great customer service), you may be able to find them by investing in certain home updates. And yes, we are saying that you can spend money on your home to save money on insurance, but look at it this way: if you’re considering any of these updates or remodels anyway, take a second look with insurance savings in mind. You may like what you see.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6homeupdatesforlowerhomeinsurancerates\">6 Home Updates for Lower Home Insurance Rates</h2>\n<p>Remember: every insurance carrier is different. Before you undertake any of these updates, check with your insurance provider to see whether (and how) they <a href=\"/blog/1-tip-to-lower-florida-homeowners-insurance/\">might lower your rates</a>. You may have to follow specific guidelines to enjoy any financial savings.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>New roof</strong>: The good news is that you’ll have to <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">replace your roof</a> eventually anyway. The bad news is that it won’t be cheap. But the second batch of good news is that if you talk to your insurance provider before getting your new house lid, you could have a lower insurance bill when the work is done. Your insurance provider’s guidelines will likely have to do with making your roof safer, less prone to <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-roof-leaks/\">leaking</a>, and more wind-resistant, so even if the insurance savings are modest, you’ll also be less likely to face costly repairs down the road.</li>\n<li><strong>Centrally monitored burglar alarm</strong>: Insurance companies offer discounts for updates that make your house safer. <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">Centrally monitored burglar alarms</a> do that by offering a service that keeps track of when your alarm is tripped (so they can check in and send help, if necessary). That also means monitored alarms tend to cost more, but you may make up the difference in insurance premium savings.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated electrical system</strong>: How old is your house? If it’s on the older side – or if your circuit breaker hasn’t been updated for 40 years or more, it’s probably time for an upgrade. Other signs: your lights dim when you turn on appliances or you use a lot of extension cords because there just aren’t enough outlets. Old or inadequate electrical infrastructure is a fire hazard. If you’ve got suspicions about your system, reach out to a local electrician for a consultation (and estimate, if necessary). Unless you yourself are an electrician, we don’t recommend trying to DIY this project.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated plumbing</strong>: Old wires can cause fires; old pipes can cause floods (sorry, no rhymes today). Most plumbing is hidden, but if you notice puddles behind appliances, floors warping from water, or mold and mildew in your crawl space, parts of your plumbing may need to be updated. The good news is that, often, it’s only connectors that wear out rather than entire pipes. To stay on top of your plumbing, investigate the status of your pipes any time you renovate your kitchen or bathroom – and plan on making some repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Stationary generator</strong>: Some insurance companies offer discounts for keeping a generator on the premises so you can keep your appliances functioning in the event of a power outage like a major storm. A generator may allow you to stay in your home when the power’s out, which is a major theft deterrent – and therefore an insurance claim deterrent.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke detectors</strong>: All homes are required to have smoke detectors, but some are better at preventing losses than others. Monitored alarms trigger notifications to first responders, which increases the odds that they’ll get to your home quickly and minimize any damage from fire or smoke. Some insurance companies offer discounts for a monitored smoke alarm, which they see as a great way to mitigate loss.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingprojectsthatcanpreventinsuranceclaims\">Remodeling Projects that Can Prevent Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Not all remodeling projects qualify for a lower homeowners insurance premium, but some may prevent your risk of claims by making your home a safer place. Here are a few to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding grab bars to bathrooms to prevent falls and injuries for older or weaker guests.</li>\n<li>Updating exterior lighting and lighting around stairs to prevent slips, trips, and falls.</li>\n<li>Repairing cracks in your sidewalk and driveway before they become a tripping hazard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you’re remodeling for the heck of it or because you’re on the prowl for the lowest homeowners insurance rates, be sure to check with your insurance provider before making any changes. While you’re on the phone, make sure you don’t need to <a href=\"/blog/home-remodel-insurance-considerations/\">make changes to your current policy</a> to accommodate the work being done.</p>"

    body: "<p>It’s no secret that home construction costs impact insurance rates. Your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimate</a>, the amount needed to rebuild your home from the bottom up, is based on construction and lumber costs. As lumber prices go up, so does your replacement cost estimate, and ultimately, your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lumberpricesareup193\">Lumber Prices Are Up 193%</h2>\n<p>Lumber prices are at an all-time high. Back in April 2021, the cost of lumber per thousand board feet hit $1,048 – a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/04/13/lumber-prices-2021-chart-price-of-lumber-futures-short-squeeze-home-sales-cost-april-2021-latest-update/\">193 percent jump</a> year over year. That surge continued throughout May, and while lumber prices have begun to fall, they’re still <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/06/04/lumber-prices-housing-market-costs-back-down/\">up over 300 percent from April 2020</a>.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows just how much lumber costs have skyrocketed in 2021 compared to the previous five years. For example, lumber prices in April 2016 hovered around $300 per thousand board feet. They steadily climbed through 2018, reaching nearly $500, dipped again in 2019, and have been climbing rapidly from 2020 through today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/lumber-prices-chart.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><i>Source: Business Insider, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price\">Markets</a>, April 21, 2021.</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"whyislumbersoexpensive\">Why Is Lumber So Expensive?</h3>\n<p>The rise in lumber prices is a result of a perfect storm that started with increased demand due to storm damage in states like Florida and Louisiana. Next came the pandemic that slowed lumber production just when everyone was staying home and starting home improvement projects. All the while, historically low mortgage rates spawned new home builds.</p>\n<p>Basically, everything that could put a demand on an industry happened in the course of a year.</p>\n<p>Sabrina Beaumont of the home-building platform <a href=\"https://passionplans.com/\">Passion Plans</a> says the extremely limited supply of wood has made it difficult for her business: “We're experiencing major delays in building projects. A lot of the contractors we work with say that they can barely build new construction profitably right now.”</p>\n<p>This is a further sign that lumber companies can’t cover their commitments. That and the upcoming hurricane season has experts predicting lumber prices will continue to rise for the rest of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constructioncostsinflationandhomeinsurancerates\">Construction Costs, Inflation, and Home Insurance Rates</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> found in every home policy is driven by the replacement cost estimate – essentially, what it costs to build a new home similar to your old home. Construction costs, both in terms of labor and materials, impact this estimate, so insurance rates go up when construction costs do. Inflation rates can help illustrate this relationship.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nationalaveragehomeownersinsurancepremiumchangevsinflationrate\">National Average Homeowners Insurance Premium Change Vs. Inflation Rate</h3>\n<p>| Year | % Premium Change | Inflation Rate |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009 | 6% | -0.4% |\n| 2010 | 3.3% | 1.6% |\n| 2011 | 7.7% | 3.2% |\n| 2012 | 5.6% | 2.1% |\n| 2013 | 6% | 1.5% |\n| 2014 | 3.3% | 1.6% |\n| 2015 | 3.6% | 0.1% |\n| 2016 | 1.6% | 1.3% |\n| 2017 | 1.6% | 2.1% |\n| 2018 | 3.1% | 2.4% |</p>\n<p>While the percent change in home insurance premiums don’t go hand in hand with the rate of inflation, they do move somewhat in line. One interesting point to note is the sudden surge in home insurance premiums and inflation in 2018. Lumber prices soared then, too, increasing 30 percent from August 2017 to January 2018 – right after Hurricane Harvey.</p>\n<p>Anything that increases demand for a good, in this case lumber, can cause inflation. The same is true if there’s a disruption in the supply chain, like a pandemic that keeps people from working. And there you have it again: the perfect storm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howstatesareaffectedbyreconstructioncosts\">How States Are Affected by Reconstruction Costs</h2>\n<p>Every state is affected differently by the cost of reconstruction. Those hit hardest tend to be areas where transporting goods is difficult and where natural disasters have forced a significant increase in the demand for reconstruction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/360value-q2-2021-usa-report.pdf\">According to Verisk 360Value Quarterly Cost Update</a> [PDF], Idaho, Hawaii, and New Mexico saw the greatest increase in reconstruction costs in Q2: 11.93, 11.06, and 10.1 percent, respectively. The stress on the construction industry created by the pandemic is exacerbated in all these states by their geography.</p>\n<p>States like Louisiana and Florida are good examples of how storm damage can lead to an increased demand for home repairs. The same can be said for California, where wildfires have also caused serious home damage and loss throughout the state. All the losses result in a higher demand for reconstruction and materials needed to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies have no choice but to consider the cost to rebuild a home when it prices homeowners insurance. While something like lumber costs is just one component of the replacement cost estimate, it is a major one that affects every insured home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscanexpectfromrisingconstructioncosts\">What Homeowners Can Expect from Rising Construction Costs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">Homeowners insurance costs</a> are on the rise because lumber costs have driven up replacement cost estimates. How much of an increase you can expect remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>Remember that replacement cost estimate is only one <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">factor insurers use to calculate your premium</a>. Many homeowners are also seeing rate increases because of their claims history, severe natural disaster exposure, and other factors.</p>\n<p>With so many variables, it’s important to control the ones you can, so make sure that your home’s replacement cost estimate is accurate. Talk to your insurance provider and review the details of how the estimate was made.</p>\n<p>Check that any recent upgrades, like hardwood floors and high-end cabinetry, are included so your coverage adequately reflects what it would cost to rebuild. This may increase the replacement cost, but it’s better to have the right amount of coverage than to be one of the <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">64 percent of homeowners who are underinsured</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>The human impact on the environment is growing and requires our attention immediately, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC’s <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM\">latest climate change report</a>, released on August 9, shows that climate change is “widespread, rapid, and intensifying.”</p>\n<p>However, the prognosis is not entirely grim. The IPCC report says we may be able to curb the effects of climate change if we can reduce greenhouse gases over the next decade.</p>\n<p>The report, which the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called \"a code red for humanity,\" comes in a year where we’ve already seen record-breaking and life-threatening temperatures, wildfires, and floods. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death Valley hit an average daily temperature of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/death-valley-records-hottest-average-temperature-over-24-hours-180978162/#\">118.1 degrees Fahrenheit</a> on July 11 and the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth, 130 degrees Fahrenheit on July 9.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2021/7/13/dixie-fire/\">California’s Dixie Fire</a>, the state’s second largest wildfire ever, started on July 13 and has burned over half a million acres. As of this writing, it continues to burn.</li>\n<li>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects up to 20 named storms for the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season\">2021 Atlantic hurricane season</a> with up to 10 of those becoming significant hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the IPCC, human-induced climate change is the driving force behind these higher temperatures and more severe hurricanes as well as the drought conditions that increase the likelihood of wildfire. And these extreme weather events do more than <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">impact homeowners insurance rates</a>. They are likely to affect everything from our food supply to our healthcare system. Most importantly, more people will find themselves in harm’s way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keyfindingsoftheipccclimatechangereport\">Key Findings of the IPCC Climate Change Report</h2>\n<p>The IPCC looked at the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere (or the frozen areas) for key indicators of climate change and our impact on it. Many of its key findings reveal changes to the earth’s climate accelerating at a rate that outstrips previous eras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Greenhouse gas levels:</strong> We have not seen atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations this high in the past 2 million years. Methane (CH4), which is much more effective at trapping heat, is at its highest levels in 800,000 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Rising temperatures:</strong> The past 50 years have warmed faster than any period of the past 2,000 years. The IPCC predicts global temperatures will continue to rise, increasing heat waves and causing longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons.</li>\n<li><strong>Melting ice:</strong> The earth’s increased surface temperature is causing more ice melt in the Arctic sea. In fact, the ice coverage in the Arctic is less than it has been for the past 1,000 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Rising sea levels:</strong> As ice melts, sea levels rise, and the current levels are the highest they’ve been in 3,000 years. And the rate the seas are rising is increasing significantly. Between 1901 and 1971, sea levels rose 1.3mm per year. Compare that to the 3.7mm per year they rose between 2006 and 2018.</li>\n<li><strong>Ocean acidification:</strong> Carbon dioxide adversely affects more than just land life. As it dissolves in seawater, CO2 causes oceans to become more acidic which damages sea life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"climatechangereportsayshumansaretoblame\">Climate Change Report Says Humans Are to Blame</h2>\n<p>The key findings above squash any notion that climate change isn’t happening. But the most important takeaway from the climate change report is the argument that human-caused greenhouse gases are the reason for our climate woes.</p>\n<p>The two biggest problems are our reliance on fossil fuels and deforestation. Burning fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal is how most American get their energy, producing heat and electricity and powering cars. But it also produces carbon dioxide which is the greenhouse gas that’s the primary reason earth’s temperatures are rising.</p>\n<p>Forests are supposed to filter out CO2 from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/#\">10 million hectares</a> of forest per year were taken down between 2015 and 2020. While this is down from 16 million hectares each year in the 90s, the number is still alarming. More importantly, the reduction in forests means there are fewer filters in the world to pull CO2 emissions out of the air and release oxygen back into the atmosphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stabilizingtheclimate\">Stabilizing the Climate</h2>\n<p>According to the IPCC climate change report, we can take steps to stabilize the environment. Specifically, the authors mention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapidly reducing methane emissions.</li>\n<li>Limiting cumulative carbon emissions.</li>\n<li>Reducing other greenhouse gases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2015 Paris climate agreement sought to achieve many of these things and to keep global warming under 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Currently, most of the world’s major economies are falling behind in their efforts. However, if dramatic changes can be made, we can limit greenhouse gas emissions and limit the effects of global warming. If that happens, the IPCC postulates that earth’s climate could start to cool in a few decades.</p>\n<p>Humans have to understand that without hard work and a change in our mentality the ramifications of climate change will be with us through this century – or longer.</p>"

Condo insurance (HO-6) is different from mobile home insurance, which is different from insurance for a single-family residential property (<a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO-3</a>).</p>\n<p>Generally, though, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> covers your dwelling (the house), personal property (clothes, furniture, TV, etc.), and other structures if they’re damaged because of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or smoke</li>\n<li>Hurricanes</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Lightning</li>\n<li>Theft or vandalism</li>\n<li>Water damage that originates from inside your home (like from a burst pipe)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be aware, though, that every policy comes with specific exclusions.</p>\n<p>Another important note: homeowners insurance also offers liability coverage in the event that a guest (NOT a resident or nanny) is injured or experiences property damage on your property.</p>\n<p>Whatever type of homeowners insurance policy you choose, homeowners insurance doesn’t cover regular wear and tear, so you should be sure to keep up with regular home maintenance throughout the year.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure where to begin, <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">this seasonal home maintenance guide</a> is a fantastic resource for digital natives, as it includes links to many DIY explainer videos to help those who’re new gutter maintenance and owning walls to pressure wash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sowhydoyouneedhomeownersinsurance\">So Why Do You Need Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>If you’re a <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/millennial-mortgage/\">millennial with a mortgage</a>, you are likely required to prove you have homeowners insurance. Your lender must have proof that their investment (and you, the guarantor) are protected from the unexpected.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’re a millennial with a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to have homeowners insurance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howtogettherightcoverageforyourproperty\">How to Get the Right Coverage for Your Property</h2>\n<p>There are three big things to consider when you’re looking at how much coverage you need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What types of activities do you plan on doing (freelancing, Airbnb hosting, running a business, etc.)</li>\n<li>What things you’ll have onsite (from laptops to heirlooms)</li>\n<li>What kinds of hazards may be in the area (weather)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s take a look at each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1isyourhousejustahomeordoyouhavebiggerplans\">1. Is Your House Just a Home, or Do You Have Bigger Plans?</h3>\n<p>The number of Americans who work for themselves could triple to <a href=\"https://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/09/27/millennials-in-the-gig-economy-6-trends/\">42 million by 2020</a>. Already, nearly <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/50-of-millennials-have-a-side-hustle/\">50 percent</a> of millennials have a side gig to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>The rise of the gig economy hits close to home for many, including homeowners who are working out of or renting out their homes to earn extra income.</p>\n<p>In the event that you plan on using your first house for multiple pursuits, your insurance company will be able to help guide you toward the right amount of coverage, but here are a few resources to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re thinking about listing your property as a short-term rental, check out this guide to <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/airbnb-ebook.pdf\">home insurance for your Airbnb</a>.</li>\n<li>If you intend to rent it out in the longer term and live off-site, do not skimp on landlord insurance, which includes more extensive liability coverage than a standard homeowners insurance policy.</li>\n<li>Will you run a small business out of your home? If so, note that homeowners insurance specifically excludes coverage for business-related activities, so you will need additional insurance to protect your business property and operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you plan to get started right away or a year down the line, if you plan to use your house as anything other than a single-family residence, be sure to discuss what kind of coverage you’ll need with your insurance company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2keepyourhomeinventoryandscheduledpropertyuptodate\">2. Keep Your Home Inventory and Scheduled Property Up to Date</h3>\n<p>If you’re a new homeowner, your move is a great opportunity to create a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> that reflects the value of your possessions. Digital support for home inventories is better than ever, and there are plenty of apps to catalog your major purchases and the condition of your appliances.</p>\n<p>If you do have any valuables in your home or pieces of personal property worth more than the limit of your standard policy, you may want to buy additional coverage for these items. It’s important to <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">schedule your high-value personal property</a> to help ensure that you’d receive compensation for that item in the event of theft or major property damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3knowtheweatherinyourneckofthewoods\">3. Know the Weather in Your Neck of the Woods</h3>\n<p>The weather is one factor no homeowner of any age can control, but the reality for millennials buying their first home is that there are more severe weather events today than there used to be.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s official stance on the issue is that anywhere it can rain, it can flood. Translation: even if your parents didn’t need flood insurance, you might.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already know about local weather patterns, do some research to get to know your area, the history of major weather events, and what your local insurance laws require.</p>\n<p>You should also read up on what your homeowners insurance covers when it comes to weather-related disasters – and what it doesn’t. A few important severe weather coverage notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hurricane insurance (sometimes called wind insurance) will cover you in the event of damage caused by wind or hail, but not flooding. This coverage is often included in a standard homeowners policy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Flood insurance</a> helps pay for damage caused by storm surges or storm-related flooding and must be purchased separately from your homeowners policy. If you live near a body of water that regularly floods or in the path of Atlantic hurricanes, you may be required to have this coverage. While your standard HO-3 and HO-6 (condo insurance) may cover water damage caused by a burst pipe or groundwater seepage, it’s not likely to cover you in the event that your home is flooded by rainwater or a storm surge.</li>\n<li>Tornado insurance isn’t really a thing, but residents of Tornado Alley are likely to pay much higher premiums that they would elsewhere because one of the main factors that determines the cost of homeowners insurance is weather.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wherever you live, adopt the habit of keeping one eye on the weather: find a <a href=\"https://time.com/5559691/best-weather-app/\">great weather app</a> and keep your notifications turned on. As a homeowner, you’ll want to know when there’s a storm headed toward your property and keep an eye out for unusual weather trends.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nearly 50 percent of millennials have a side gig to make ends meet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"getcoveragethatworksforyourwallet\">Get Coverage That Works for Your Wallet</h2>\n<p>In a recent survey, an astonishing <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/homebuyers-survey-february-2019/\">63 percent</a> of millennials expressed regret about buying their first home, and the chief complaint was the burden of unexpected costs. This includes monthly overhead, which includes regular insurance payments and maintenance costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, one goal of homeowners insurance is to make major, storm-related repairs less burdensome, but it’s also important to have a homeowners insurance policy you can comfortably afford month to month.</p>\n<p>The basic concept behind most homeowners insurance plans is that you make a modest payment every month (called a premium) to a company that will provide financial assistance to repair or replace things damaged by covered events.</p>\n<p>This financial assistance kicks in after you, the homeowner, put a certain amount of money toward the repairs or replacements (this is called your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>). Deductibles ensure that risk is shared between you and your insurer. This helps keep premiums affordable by deterring small claims.</p>\n<p>A house is a huge investment; you’re not expected to be able to afford major repairs or a complete replacement on your own. So it matters that you pick the right plan. The right plan is one you can afford today and the one that provides enough funds that you can restore your home the day after the storm hits.</p>\n<p>In other words, you want a plan that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has a premium you can afford to pay every month.</li>\n<li>Has a deductible you can afford to pay in the event of a major claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally speaking, the lower your premiums, the higher your deductible. Your task in picking insurance is to find a plan with the right coverage for your property at a cost that works for you.</p>\n<p>For example, a plan with a $10,000 deductible may come with very low monthly premiums – but it’s not a good fit for you unless you have $10,000 sitting around that you can afford to put toward a major home repair.</p>\n<p>And again: if you operate a business out of your home, damage to it will not be covered by your homeowners insurance policy. To protect a home business or side gig, you’ll need a separate business insurance policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shoparoundforareasonablepremium\">Shop Around for a Reasonable Premium</h3>\n<p>There are a few main <a href=\"/blog/11-factors-impacting-home-insurance-premium/\">factors that influence your homeowners insurance premium</a>, and most of them are out of your hands (including local weather, the population, and how close you live to a fire station). But even though some factors that affect the cost of your insurance are out of your control, you can shop around for a reasonable premiums.</p>\n<p>It’s wise to compare several home insurance options to find the plan that’s best for your budget. New homeowners insurance providers on the market today, like Kin, make it easier than ever to do just that. These companies know that millennials expect information and applications to be readily available online – and thanks to millennials like <a href=\"/about/\">Kin’s founders</a>, there are now startups that use digitally available information to improve homeowners insurance and help reduce costs for customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whataboutfilingahomeownersinsuranceclaim\">What about Filing a Homeowners Insurance Claim?</h3>\n<p>Hopefully you’ll never have to file a homeowners insurance claim, and the odds are in your favor: <a href=\"/blog/most-homeowners-claim-free/\">88 percent of insured homeowners have never filed a claim</a>.</p>\n<p>Experts recommend keeping a deductible of at least $2,000 to dissuade yourself from filing small claims like repairs that you can afford to pay off on your own. Bear in mind that your claims history impacts your home insurance premiums, so it's smart to only file claims when you absolutely must.</p>\n<p>If there is major damage to your property and you don’t know what to do, pick up the phone and call your insurance company. They’ll be happy to give you instructions on how to document and file your claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enjoyhomeownership\">Enjoy Homeownership!</h2>\n<p>Owning a home is a lot of work, but it also comes with a lot of rewards (want to paint the walls? Go ahead!). Making sure you’ve adequately protected what’s probably your biggest asset is one of the best ways to make sure you enjoy those rewards, and we at Kin are happy to support you in that process. And now: enough about insurance. Get out there and meet your new neighbors!</p>"

Your mobile home VIN number is more than just a registration number – it holds key information about your mobile home.</p>\n<p>When you’re ready to get a quote for <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a>, find your VIN. You’ll need it to get an accurate rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisamobilehomevinnumber\">What is a mobile home VIN number?</h2>\n<p>Think of your VIN as a code that contains details about your <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-mobile-home/\">mobile home</a>. It’s an easy way to identify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The manufacturer.</strong> The first piece of information found in your mobile home’s VIN is an abbreviation for its manufacturer. Typically, these are three letters that tell you who made the mobile home.</li>\n<li><strong>The state where it was built.</strong> The next two letters identify the state where the home was built.</li>\n<li><strong>Serial number.</strong> This set of numbers assigned by the manufacturer is unique to your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Section code.</strong> This letter tells you if the mobile home has more than one section and where the data plate is in the home. Single-wide homes with only one section don’t have a section code. Sections are defined as A or B to signify double-wide and triple-wide homes respectively.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The VIN on your mobile home should match the VIN listed on the ownership title. If you have more than one section, you most likely have a VIN and title for each section of your home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/group-1803-1.png\" alt=\"Image of a sample mobile home VIN: JACFL999999A. JAC is an abbreviation for the manufacture, FL is the state, 999999 is the serial number, and A is what section of the mobile home.\" /></p>\n<p>This sample mobile home VIN tells us the home was manufactured by Jacobsen Homes in Florida, its serial number is 999999, and that its for section #1 of the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretofindyourmobilehomevin\">Where to find your mobile home VIN</h2>\n<p>Your mobile home VIN number is often found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the data plate inside your home.</li>\n<li>Stamped on your mobile home’s steel frame.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires every mobile home to have a data plate, which is installed while the home is built in the factory. The plate can often be found on the master bedroom’s closet wall, under the kitchen sink on the cabinet doors, or near the home’s HVAC system closet, electrical panel, or backdoor. Some mobile homeowners find that the data plate has been removed or painted over, so you may need to do some exploring.</p>\n<p>Your VIN may also be located on the exterior of the home. Mobile homes with more than one section usually have a slightly different VIN for each section.</p>\n<p>If your mobile home already has a skirt around it, locating the steel chassis may be difficult. You’re looking for letters and numbers that are at least three-eighths of an inch tall. Look for the steel beam running parallel with the front of the home that the original triangular tongue beam attached to when transporting. This is one of the easier places to locate the VIN. For other areas of the mobile home, you may have to remove some of the skirting to locate it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsonadataplate\">What’s on a data plate?</h2>\n<p>In addition to your mobile home VIN, that data plate has other handy information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The manufacturer’s name and address.</li>\n<li>A serial number with model designation.</li>\n<li>The date of manufacture.</li>\n<li>A statement required by HUD: “This manufactured home is designed to comply with Federal manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in force at the time of manufacture.”</li>\n<li>A list of certification labels affixed to each transportable section of the home.</li>\n<li>A list of all factory-installed equipment.</li>\n<li>A map and reference with wind zone, snow load, and roof load of the manufactured home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should protect your data plate if you ever remodel or repair your mobile home. Put plastic over it and take and store photos of the plate to make sure the data remains accessible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourdataplateismissing\">What to do if your data plate is missing</h2>\n<p>The data plate is attached to a cabinet or wall on the interior of the home and should never be removed. In fact, if you plan on remodeling cabinets, you want to take the data plate off and reaffix it to another cabinet or wall. But if it is lost or missing, you’ll need to replace it in order to legally sell the home, make improvements, or get insurance.</p>\n<p>You can only get a new data plate by applying for one with the <a href=\"https://www.ibts.org/\">Institute for Building Technology and Safety</a> (IBTS). A basic certification costs $50, but you can get it expedited for $100.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahudtag\">What is a HUD tag?</h2>\n<p>While searching for your data plate and VIN, you may run across another important tag on your mobile home. This is a <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/mhs/mhslabels\">HUD tag</a> (also called a certification label), and it’s a two-inch by four-inch metal plate on the back exterior of your mobile home. On it, you’ll find a three-letter that identifies the in-plant primary inspection agency that inspected your mobile home. HUD tags also have six-digit serial numbers that the label supplier furnishes.</p>\n<p>All manufactured homes made after June 1976 must have a HUD tag. Additionally, <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> often require your home to have a HUD tag to ensure the home meets construction and safety standards. Many companies won’t insure a mobile home without one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourhudtagismissing\">What to do if your HUD tag is missing</h2>\n<p>HUD will not reissue your HUD tag if it goes missing. Instead, you need to contact the IBTS, which may be able to issue a letter verifying the specific certification labels that had been attached to your home. This gives your insurance company the necessary information about the home.</p>\n<p>And now that you know where to find all this information about your home, let’s see if you can save some money on your mobile home insurance.

    body: "<p>These two types of insurance both deal with your home, but in very different ways. Learn what they do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedifferencebetweenmortgageinsuranceandhomeinsurance\">The Difference between Mortgage Insurance and Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you’re a first-time homebuyer, there’s a good chance you’ve come across the term “mortgage insurance.” And if you’re like a lot of homebuyers we talk to, you’ve probably wondered how it’s different from <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Let's look at both types of insurance so you can understand whether you need either or both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homemortgageinsurancelenderprotectionfordownpaymentsbelow20\">Home Mortgage Insurance: Lender Protection for Down Payments below 20%</h2>\n<p>Most of us have to buy homes with help from a mortgage loan, usually issued by a bank or credit union. Essentially, the bank fronts you the money for the cost of the house and you make regular payments on that loan (mortgage payments) until you’ve paid it off or until you sell the home.</p>\n<p>But in most situations, banks don’t want to lend people hundreds of thousands of dollars without any collateral. That collateral is typically called a “down payment” and is usually measured as a percentage of the total cost of a home.</p>\n<p>If a borrower can put 20 percent of the home’s cost “down,” banks don’t require <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>. That’s because, if a borrower misses a payment, the bank has a decent pile of cash already. If it has to foreclose on the house and resell it, there’s a reasonable chance its costs will be covered, thanks to that down payment.</p>\n<p>If a borrower makes a down payment of less than 20 percent, lenders require mortgage insurance. This is a policy that helps lenders manage the risk that a borrower will stop making payments on their mortgage loan (aka default on the loan).</p>\n<p>It’s in lenders’ best interest to make paying mortgage insurance easy, so borrowers usually have several payment options. One of the most popular is to pay monthly, as part of a bundle with your mortgage payment.</p>\n<p>To summarize, home mortgage insurance is a policy that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You, the borrower, pay.</li>\n<li>Protects your lender from the risk that you’ll default on your loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsuranceprotectionforpropertydamageandliability\">Homeowners Insurance: Protection for Property Damage and Liability</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance is a policy that covers you, the homeowner, for various things that could go wrong on a property you own. (You’re considered the owner even if you buy a property with a mortgage loan.) A typical homeowners policy offers protection for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">home’s structure</a> from certain events.</li>\n<li>Theft of or damage to <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">your possessions</a> that you keep inside your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Liability</a> you may have related to injuries or property damage that happens to guests at your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the homeowner, you want to be protected for a wide range of things that can go wrong at your house.</p>\n<p>But you may have noticed that, on your mortgage loan paperwork, your lender only requires you to have “<a href=\"/blog/what-is-hazard-insurance/\">hazard insurance</a>,” meaning insurance that covers physical damage to the home itself. That's because the lender wants to protect its interest in the property.</p>\n<p>In other words, your lender fronted a bunch of money so you could buy your home. Until you’ve paid that money back, it wants to make sure you have a way to repair the home if something terrible happens to it. If you don’t, it won’t be able to resell the home and could lose a lot of money. So it requires hazard insurance. It doesn’t matter to the lender what happens to all your stuff because it wouldn’t resell that anyway.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re considering your first mortgage or have owned a home for decades, finding the right insurance is crucial to protecting yourself.

    body: "<p>If you’ve never refinanced your mortgage before, it can feel like a steep learning curve. How do you know which refinancing option is right for you?</p>\n<p>Refinancing simply means you take an existing <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a> and replace it with a new mortgage for the same property. You aren’t moving, just changing the terms of your loan while you continue living in your home.</p>\n<p>Refinancing makes sense when you want to reduce your interest rate, get rid of private mortgage insurance, lower your monthly payments, or extend your term. Let’s take a look at some common refinancing options and when you might consider them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raterefinance\">Rate refinance</h2>\n<p>The rate refinance is one of the most straightforward refinancing options. In this refinance, you take your old loan and swap it out for a new loan with a lower interest rate. By lowering the interest rate, you’ll save on your monthly mortgage payments and pay less interest over the course of the loan. Ultimately, this refinance is done to save money in both the short and long term.</p>\n<p>Consider a rate refinance if interest rates have gone down significantly since you closed on your existing mortgage. You want the savings to be enough to offset the closing costs associated with the new mortgage. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/refinance/when-and-when-not-to-refinance-mortgage/\">Most experts agree that if you can save at least one percent</a> (better if it’s at least two percent) on your interest rate, it makes sense to refinance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"termrefinance\">Term refinance</h2>\n<p>While all refinances adjust the terms of your loan, a term refinance is done specifically to change how long it will take to repay the loan. When you do a term refinance, you are trying to achieve one of two things: extend the loan length or shorten it.</p>\n<p>You might want to extend the loan length if you can dramatically reduce your monthly payments by taking longer to pay the loan. Conversely, if you are trying to pay off a mortgage faster, you can often get a better rate for changing from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Consider a term refinance that lengthens the loan only if absolutely necessary. You’ll be adding closing costs to the loan (or paying them out of pocket), making refinancing potentially expensive. This might be a good option if your income has decreased and is expected to stay that way for a while. It’s better to extend the term of the mortgage than be overextended on your monthly payments.</p>\n<p>Consider a term refinance that shortens your loan if you are looking to pay more each month to pay off your home sooner. By converting from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, you’ll pay more each month and potentially be debt-free faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrefinance\">FHA loan refinance</h2>\n<p>There are two FHA mortgage refinance meanings. The first option takes an FHA loan – a loan backed by the Federal Housing Authority – and rolls it along with the associated loan fees into a new FHA loan. This is no different than any other mortgage refinance.</p>\n<p>The other option is a <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/removing-private-mortgage-insurance/\">PMI-canceling refinance</a>. This type of FHA loan refinance allows you to take an FHA mortgage that has enough equity in the property and refinance it into a conventional loan to get rid of the costly private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI can be as much as 2.25 percent of the original loan amount per year, so it’s pretty expensive to have tacked on to your payments. FHA loans that don’t have at least 20 percent equity in the property are required to pay PMI to insure the loan against default.</p>\n<p>Consider an FHA loan refinance to cancel out PMI as soon as it’s feasible to do so. This means you need to have been in the home for at least two years and built up enough equity (by payment or appreciation) to meet lender requirements. Be sure to talk to your lender to see if there are other guidelines you must meet to be eligible for an FHA refinance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cashoutrefinance\">Cash-out refinance</h2>\n<p>A cash-out refinance takes an existing mortgage and refinances it while adding into the new loan some of the equity built up in the home. For example, if your home was valued at $350,000 and you had a $200,000 mortgage, you could do a cash-out refinance of $300,000 and take $100,000 in cash when the loan closes to use for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>Folks often do a cash-out refinance to get funds to update, remodel, or renovate their homes. They can also use it to pay for kids’ college education or to consolidate other debts. Many people consolidate <a href=\"/blog/tricks-to-paying-off-credit-cards/\">expensive credit card debt</a> into their mortgage through a cash-out refinance, paying off the credit cards to then make higher monthly mortgage payments at a better rate.</p>\n<p>Consider a cash-out refinance if you don’t have another way to fund your need. Remember that you’re adding that extra cash to a 15- or 30-year mortgage, so you’ll be paying interest on it for years to come. When consolidating debt, make sure you <a href=\"/blog/best-budgeting-apps/\">change your spending habits</a> so you don’t rack up more unsecured debt and risk foreclosure on your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noclosingcostrefinance\">No-closing-cost refinance</h2>\n<p>We’ve talked about making sure you can afford the closing costs associated with a refinance. Most every refinance has them and you either pay them out of pocket or have the costs rolled into your loan. But there is a refinance that doesn’t charge any closing costs: the no-closing-cost refinance.</p>\n<p>This type of refinance sounds great when you consider closing costs may be $10,000 or more. But keep in mind that nothing is free. Your lender will make up for the lack of closing costs by charging a higher interest rate. If closing costs are added to the loan term, some lenders may refer to it as a no-closing-cost refinance because the borrower doesn’t need to pay the costs out of pocket at close. Either way, lenders will find a way to get their money.</p>\n<p>Consider a no-closing-cost refinance if you don’t have the funds to pay for closing costs and if the loan will save you money in the long run. Be sure to ask the lender <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/if-you-refinance-a-mortgage-when-will-you-break-even\">what your break-even point is</a> – that is, how long it takes to recoup the refinance costs through what you save each month by refinancing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helocrefinance\">HELOC refinance</h2>\n<p>A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a mortgage product that uses the equity in your home to give you a credit line. It’s a loan in addition to your mortgage, and its balance can fluctuate as you pay it off and use it again for anything from home repairs to a dream vacation. A HELOC refinance is when you combine the HELOC with your mortgage into a one 15-year or 30-year mortgage with one payment.</p>\n<p>Consider a HELOC refinance if you have a large HELOC balance that you can’t seem to pay down. HELOCs usually have higher interest rates than your primary mortgage so combining them and extending the term can help you pay the debt off. While most homeowners prefer the flexibility of the HELOC, if the interest is higher and you can’t pay it off, you might be better off refinancing it all into one, less expensive loan.</p>\n<p>To learn more about mortgages, <a href=\"/blog/tag/mortgages/\">check out our blog series</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Without the funds to buy a home outright, you’ll need a mortgage to buy your first home. And you’re not alone – 63 percent of homeowners currently have a mortgage.</p>\n<p>Of the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-17/close-to-40-of-u-s-homes-are-free-and-clear-of-a-mortgage\">37 percent of homeowners</a> that are mortgage-free in 2020, nearly all of them had a mortgage at one point.</p>\n<p>But what should you look for in a mortgage? How do you go about getting one? What down payment should you expect? And what’s a debt-to-income ratio, anyway? These are some questions we set out to answer in your guide to mortgages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mortgagesexplainedwhatisamortgage\">Mortgages explained: What is a mortgage?</h2>\n<p>A mortgage is a legal contract, usually between you, the home buyer, and the lender that’s facilitating your home purchase. In exchange for regular and timely payments, the lender will provide the funds for the property.</p>\n<p>If you don’t make those mortgage payments, the lender has the right to foreclose on the property – that means it can take possession of the home and sell it.</p>\n<p>Unlike other forms of debt, like credit cards, mortgages are a secured debt because they are backed by the full value of the property.</p>\n<p>A mortgage term is how long the mortgage lasts. The most common terms are 30-year and 15-year mortgages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofmortgageloans\">Types of mortgage loans</h2>\n<p>When applying for a mortgage, it helps to know what type of mortgage is right for you. Each type of mortgage has different credit score and down payment requirements. Some loan options, like an FHA loan, have government backing, which means the requirements are less strict.</p>\n<p>Here are the most common types of mortgage loans for first-time home buyers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"federalhousingadministrationfhaloan\">Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan</h3>\n<p>An FHA loan is a mortgage backed and insured by the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA doesn’t lend money itself, but it does partner with lenders for this program.</p>\n<p>FHA loans are a good starter mortgage if you have less-than-perfect credit or you don’t have a lot in savings that you can put toward a down payment. Think of an FHA loan as a way to literally get your foot in the door of your first house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re a first-time home buyer with a FICO credit score of at least 580, you may qualify for an FHA loan and can put as little as 3.5 percent down.</li>\n<li>If your credit score is below 580, you can still qualify for an FHA loan, but you will likely be required to put down 10 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use the FHA program, you will have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you’ve accumulated about 20 percent of equity in the home. If you put down 10 percent on the home, you’ll pay PMI for 11 years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"departmentofveteransaffairsvaloan\">Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan</h3>\n<p>A VA loan is a type of mortgage available to service members, veterans, and eligible spouses. This mortgage is insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs for eligible applicants to purchase a primary residence through partner lenders.</p>\n<p>The biggest draw of a VA loan? Recipients can put $0 down, making this one of the most affordable paths to homeownership on the list. There is no credit requirement for this loan based on VA rules, but most lenders require a score of 580 or more, like an FHA loan.</p>\n<p>Unlike an FHA loan, a VA loan doesn’t require borrowers to pay PMI. But the VA may <a href=\"https://housemethod.com/\">require a termite inspection</a> before loaning any money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usdepartmentofagricultureusdaloan\">US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan</h3>\n<p>The USDA loan is similar to the FHA and VA loans. These are loans fund home purchases in rural communities and are guaranteed by the USDA. The goal is to help improve both the economy as well as the quality of life in rural areas of the United States.</p>\n<p>These are zero down loans, but PMI is required. Borrowers must have at least a 580 FICO score to be eligible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fanniemae\">Fannie Mae</h3>\n<p>Fannie Mae is a conventional mortgage that is offered by a partner lender. The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) backs the loan in the secondary market.</p>\n<p>These loans have higher credit requirements for first-time home buyers: a 620 FICO credit score. Qualifying borrowers only need 3 percent down for a fixed-rate mortgage or 5 percent for an adjustable-rate mortgage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"freddiemac\">Freddie Mac</h3>\n<p>Freddie Mac is another conventional mortgage program that requires a 620 FICO score and allows as little 3 percent down. Rather than be guaranteed by FNMA, a Freddie Mac mortgage is backed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creditscorerequirementsbythemortgage\">Credit score requirements by the mortgage</h2>\n<p>Before you start shopping for lenders, check your credit score. <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/\">Credit Karma</a> is free and allows you to monitor your TransUnion and Equifax credit scores.</p>\n<p>Knowing your credit score can help you set expectations for which loans you qualify for. It can also help you dispute claims on your credit report to improve your score before you begin house hunting.</p>\n<p>Your credit score also informs the interest rate on your mortgage (among other factors). Taking steps to improve your score now can help you pay less interest in the long term.</p>\n<p>These are the <a href=\"https://www.quickenloans.com/learn/credit-score-to-buy-a-house\">credit score requirements for loans</a>.</p>\n<p>| Loan Type | Minimum Credit Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| FHA (3.5% Down) | 580 |\n| FHA (10% Down) | 500 |\n| VA | Technically no minimum, but depends on the lender |\n| USDA | 580 |\n| Fannie Mae | 620 |\n| Freddie Mac | 620 |</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingyourdebttoincomeratio\">Understanding your debt-to-income ratio</h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\">debt-to-income (DTI)</a> ratio is another big factor in whether you qualify for a mortgage. A DTI ratio is the percentage of your monthly income that is used to pay monthly debt. That includes car payments, credit card payments, student loans, and the proposed mortgage payment. In many ways, DTI tells you how much house you can afford.</p>\n<p>Now roll up your sleeves because we’re going to get into the weeds a bit. There are two DTIs you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Front-end DTI:</strong> This figure compares your mortgage payment to your income.</li>\n<li><strong>Back-end DTI:</strong> In addition to your housing expenses, this figure includes the other debts in its comparison to the money you bring in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lenders look at DTI ratios to make sure you can handle your monthly payments – including the proposed mortgage and PMI. The lower your DTI, the better because it means you have extra money every month.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at an example of calculating back-end DTI. Say your monthly income is $3,500. Between credit card payments, a car loan, your student loans, and your proposed mortgage payment, your monthly debt is $1,500.</p>\n<p><strong>DTI = Monthly Debt Payments / Monthly Income</strong></p>\n<p>So $1,590 divided by $3,500 is a DTI of 45.4 percent.</p>\n<p>You can see in the chart below the DTI ratio lenders may look for depending on the loan you want.</p>\n<p>| Loan Type | Front-End DTI | Back-End DTI |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| FHA (3.5% Down) | 31% | 43% |\n| FHA (10% Down) | 31% | 43% |\n| VA | 41% | 41% |\n| USDA | 29% | 41% |\n| Fannie Mae | 36% | 50% |\n| Freddie Mac | 36% | 50% |</p>\n<h2 id=\"mortgageprequalificationvspreapproval\">Mortgage pre-qualification vs. pre-approval</h2>\n<p>It’s important to understand the difference between a pre-qualification and pre-approval because it can affect your ability to win a bid on a home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A pre-qualification is a letter from a lender with an estimate of what you might borrow based on your finances and a credit check.</li>\n<li>Pre-approval letters are an offer to lend you a specific amount of money, and it’s good for 90 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pre-approval letters hold more weight when you bid on a home because the lender has done all the underwriting on you with the exception of having the actual purchase home in place. Essentially, the lender has gone through the credit score, verified your income, and done a complete debt-to-income ratio score. The loan is approved contingent on the home appraisal coming in at a high enough number and barring any change in your credit profile.</p>\n<p>Changes in your credit profile might include acquiring more debt (don’t finance that furniture just yet), loss of income (keep your boss happy), or derogatory credit items appearing (make sure everything is paid on time).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathappenswhenyouapplyamortgage\">What happens when you apply a mortgage</h2>\n<p>Getting a mortgage starts with an application with a lender. Lenders can be banks, credit unions, or even private parties, though private parties may not have the same lending standards that banks and credit unions have.</p>\n<p>During the application process, the lender will gather information about your income, debts, and credit scores. You may have a specific property in mind when applying, but it’s also not necessary to get the process started.</p>\n<p>The lender will determine if you can afford the property and how much it will cost in interest. If no property is designated for the loan, a price cap is determined as the top amount of money that a buyer can afford based on the total DTI.</p>\n<p>When you apply for a mortgage, you will need to provide the lender with your Social Security Number, pay stubs, previous tax returns, and debt. The lender will use this information to determine if you are eligible for the loan and if so, how much you can borrow for a home purchase.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more tips on mortgages and the home buying process.</p>"

    body: "<p>Every year approximately 6% of American homeowners file some sort of claim. Many are for property damage from perils like wind, fire, and flood. But homeowners also file claims for their personal liability. Knowing which types are the most common home insurance claims can help you protect against them.</p>\n<p>According to the Insurance Information Institute (III) latest annual study into the <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">causes of home insurance losses</a>, almost 98% of home insurance claims are for property damage. Liability claims, though far less frequent, are considerably more expensive when they occur.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1windhail455ofclaims\">1. Wind &amp; hail (45.5% of claims)</h2>\n<p>This category encompasses destruction caused by <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, tornadoes, and the wind associated with thunderstorms, so it’s no wonder it comes in first for frequency. Think about it: When major wind events roll into town, they often do a lot of damage – enough that repairs are greater than an insurance deductible, so it makes sense to make a claim on a policy.</p>\n<p>But while wind and hail account for more than a third of all homeowners insurance claims, they’re actually not the most expensive. The average is only $11,695 per claim on average, making them number four overall in terms of cost. Read on and you’ll see that this makes wind and hail about a fifth as expensive as fire damage (shudder).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2fireandlightningdamage238ofclaims\">2. Fire and lightning damage (23.8% of claims)</h2>\n<p>While fire and lightning claims rank third for frequency and second for percent of losses incurred, they tend to be the most expensive claims, with a whopping average price tag of $77,340. The good news? <a href=\"/blog/the-history-of-homeowners-insurance-in-america/\">Homeowners insurance was originally designed</a> to protect against fires, so coverage for fire claims is easy to find.</p>\n<p>The bad news, obviously, is that fires can destroy a lot of property fast (hence the high cost of claims).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3waterdamagefreezing199ofclaims\">3. Water Damage &amp; Freezing (19.9% of Claims)</h2>\n<p>When <a href=\"/blog/how-to-keep-pipes-from-freezing/\">pipes freeze and burst</a> or appliances leak, serious damage can result. And it happens fairly often: More than one in five homeowners insurance claims relate to this type of water damage.</p>\n<p>In addition to being common, these claims are somewhat expensive, ranking third overall and coming in at about $11,650 on average.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4allotherpropertydamage79ofclaims\">4. All other property damage (7.9% of claims)</h2>\n<p>Miscellaneous property damage can take a million forms: a tree falling through your roof, a baseball shattering your window, a trash truck backing into your brand-new garage. Because of the sheer variety here, the average cost of these types of claims isn’t too informative. But for the record, it’s $6,773.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5bodilyinjuryorpropertydamagetoothers2ofclaims\">5. Bodily injury or property damage to others (2% of claims)</h2>\n<p>Let’s all be glad liability claims are rare because they tend to be really expensive. As a refresher, liability refers to your duty toward other people. So when a guest is injured or has their property damaged while visiting your home, you may be liable for their medical costs or the costs to repair or replace their property.</p>\n<p>Liability claims rank second in average cost, coming in at $30,324. The good news? Most homeowners insurance policies offer <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability protection</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6theft06ofclaims\">6. Theft (0.6% of claims)</h2>\n<p>The sixth most common homeowners insurance claim is theft. Coming in at just under one percent of all claims with an average claim cost of $4,415, theft is the smallest of the big guys, you could say.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to reduce your risk of theft even further, consider installing a <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-security-system-benefits/\">home security system</a>. Some insurers even offer premium discounts for doing this!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7medicalpaymentsandothercauses03\">7. Medical payments and other causes (0.3%)</h2>\n<p>Rounding out the list of top home insurance claims is payments for medical care for property-related injuries. While 0.3% may seem insignificant in terms of percentage of claims, the average loss for these types of claims is $7,147 – the fifth most expensive type of claim according to the III’s study.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mitigateyourrisktosaveyourhomeyourmoney\">Mitigate Your Risk to Save Your Home &amp; Your Money</h2>\n<p>Homeowners don’t want bad things to happen to their houses because they’re expensive, sad, and a pain to deal with. Insurance companies also don’t want bad things to happen because bad things cost them money.</p>\n<p>That’s why a lot of insurance carriers offer lower premiums for homeowners who mitigate their risk. Risk mitigation might involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a smoke alarm with working batteries.</li>\n<li>Having a fire extinguisher.</li>\n<li>Living near a fire department.</li>\n<li>Having a home security system.</li>\n<li>Having a carbon monoxide detector.</li>\n<li>Maintaining your plumbing and sprinkler systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One important note: While safety and security updates are almost always wise, they don’t all lead to an insurance discount. If you’re considering higher-end upgrades with an eye on premium savings, check with your insurer first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcoveragedoineed\">How Much Coverage Do I Need?</h2>\n<p>Understanding the types of risks you’re vulnerable to can help you figure out your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. The likelihood of those risks plus other factors, such as your home’s location, features, and value, all play a part in the <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">amount of coverage</a> you need. With more than 10 million Americans having to file some sort of <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">home insurance claim</a> each year, it’s important to be as protected as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in December 2017.

But what does that mean exactly?</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehomeinsuranceclaimscommon\">Are home insurance claims common?</h2>\n<p>Good news: the majority of homeowners are claims-free.

Let’s see what they said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surveyhighlights\">Survey highlights</h2>\n<p>Of the 11 percent of surveyed homeowners who filed a claim in the last 15 years, most filed because of hail, wind, or flood damage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Common%20Claims.png?width=754&name=Common%20Claims.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Most claims fell within the $1,000 to less than $5,000 range and the $5,000 to less than $10,000 range.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Claim%20Costs.png?width=701&name=Claim%20Costs.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Of the steps involved in filing a claim, respondents struggled most with receiving appropriate payment for their claim (with 25 percent saying it was either somewhat or very difficult), followed by dealing with the claims adjuster (about 19 percent either had a somewhat or very difficult time with this).</p>\n<p>About 36 percent described the overall claims process as either somewhat or very stressful, though most (67 percent) were very satisfied with how their provider handled the claim.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Claims-Experience-Stress.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most claims were caused by hail, wind, and flood damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"2thingstodobeforefilingaclaim\">2 things to do before filing a claim</h2>\n<p>While the hope is that you’ll never have to use your insurance, you never know what the future holds. These are some steps you can take now before you ever experience a loss. Your future self will thank you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep good records.</strong> Create a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> now – it can be invaluable when you face serious property damage. Essentially, a home inventory is a list of valuable items you own. A thorough account will include a photo of the item; its make, model, and serial number; receipts; and its appraisal, if applicable. This inventory will help you keep track of what’s damaged or missing and how much it’s worth. This documentation can be used to support your claim. Learn more here.</li>\n<li><strong>Review your policy every year.</strong> Your declarations page – usually the first page of your home insurance policy – lists the incidents your insurance covers and the maximum amount you can get from a claim. Check this page before filing a claim to see if your loss is covered before you initiate the claims process, which can be logged on your insurance report and potentially impact your coverage options in the future. This yearly review of your policy can also help you make sure your coverage still reflects the current realities of your home life. You don’t want to be left underinsured.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When in doubt about your coverage and or claim, reach out to your insurance provider for guidance. That’s what we’re here for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtohardenyourhome\">How to harden your home</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do as a homeowner is to harden your home against <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>. This not only reduces your likelihood for filing claims, but it can also help you better protect your loved one. Here are some tips that can minimize claims at your house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">Trim trees</a> around the property.</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> on windows.</li>\n<li>Use smart technology to prevent water leaks.</li>\n<li>Get a <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-security-system-benefits/\">home security system</a>.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">signs it’s time to replace your roof</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoiding claims just makes good sense. Seriously, who needs the hassle? But if you do need to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a> on your Kin Insurance policy, we work to make that as easy as possible.

    body: "<p>Here's what it takes to build a hurricane response strategy that works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iftechisntattheheartofyourhurricaneresponseplanyouredoingitwrong\">If Tech Isn't at the Heart of Your Hurricane Response Plan, You're Doing It Wrong</h2>\n<p>As a tech company providing <a href=\"/\">home insurance</a>, the most important interaction we have with our customers is when their house gets damaged and they need help getting it repaired. For claims, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> like Irma, the largest storm <a href=\"https://qz.com/1074185/hurricane-irma-all-the-meteorological-records-the-storm-has-broken-so-far/\">ever recorded</a> in the Atlantic, are the ultimate punch in the mouth because they create severe damage to a lot of customers all at once.</p>\n<p>The legacy technology used by insurance companies for dealing with claims is the telephone, which just isn’t good enough, particularly in a disaster situation. We needed a new strategy for handling the damage to our clients’ homes. And we needed it <em>fast</em>.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how we built the best hurricane response process, that made our customers’ lives easier in a time of stress, and got comments like “A lot of people wish they had Kin” from our customers, and how we built it in about 12 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communicatingwithcustomersinadisaster\">Communicating with Customers in a Disaster</h2>\n<p>After a hurricane there are often no roads, no phone, no internet, no power and our customers have a lot of other stuff to worry about. Getting in touch is a challenge.</p>\n<p>Given the situation we decided to build our claims process on top of SMS. So we built an integration from our CRM system into <a href=\"https://www.sendsonar.com/\">Sonar</a> and sent a text message to every customer, seeing if they were okay and asking if their house had sustained damage.</p>\n<p>We kept it super simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sam, this is Kin Insurance. How is everything? You can text us at this number to start the claims process. This way you don’t have to wait on hold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>In less than 30 minutes we had received an SMS reply from more than half of our clients.</strong> We routed their text responses into our policy administration system, our CRM system, our claims system and <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, creating company-wide visibility into how customers were communicating with us and which customers needed the most help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customerstolduswhattheyneededfromus\">Customers Told Us What They Needed from Us</h2>\n<p>It’s hard to overstate just how amazing this was. We went from “jeez, I wonder how bad it was” to having instant visibility into who was fine and who was affected in about half an hour. We quickly triaged our customers into “fine”, “has some damage, need to file a claim” and “home uninhabitable.”</p>\n<p>Most importantly, it opened up a line of communication with our customers.</p>\n<p>Many of them replied back saying they were fine and thanking us for checking in:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/text-response.jpeg?width=980&name=text-response.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Phew</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fence.jpeg?width=1280&name=fence.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Many customers had questions about their coverages, so having the customer text responses tied into our policy administration system was useful because it meant our CSRs could quickly reply with a text message explaining the coverage to the customer.</p>\n<p>For example, this customer didn’t know if her fence was covered (it was), her deductible ($2,000), and if she should file a claim (probably not, unless there was more damage to her home).</p>\n<p>For customers who had more significant damage we pushed the description and photos sent by the customer directly into the claims system to help with prioritizing the assignment of claims adjusters and increase the adjusters’ efficiency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/roof.jpeg?width=1000&name=roof.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"textingisefficientwhokneweveryone\">Texting Is Efficient. Who Knew? (Everyone.)</h2>\n<p>Overall, handling claims via text improved our efficiency by around 20x. It also established a very high service level for our customers with nearly instantaneous responses. They responded when they were able, and sent in pictures of the damage to their property en masse. Many also indicated that they weren’t sure of the conditions of their roof.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/drone.jpeg?width=1000&name=drone.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"sendinthedrones\">Send in the Drones!</h2>\n<p>From the reports coming in via SMS, the 5,000+ variables we collect on each house during underwriting, and the weather data about the storm itself, we had a pretty good idea of which houses were most at risk. So, we had a drone visit each one. In some cases we were able to identify damage on top of the house that was not easy to see.</p>\n<p>The drones provided by <a href=\"https://www.betterview.net/\">BetterView</a> and <a href=\"https://dispatchadrone.com/\">DispatchADrone</a> and aerial imagery from <a href=\"http://go.nearmap.com/\">Nearmap</a> were often able to see damage to the customers’ house before they had even returned home, since many people left the state for safety purposes before the storm hit. It also removes some of the burden from homeowners that would have trouble reaching their roof to document the damage themselves.</p>\n<p>Having good video and photo records very quickly after the event helps us ensure the claim is settled quickly and accurately. And this is ultimately what the whole process is for — getting our clients compensated for damage to their home in a timely fashion, and doing it without adding to their worries after a natural disaster. Next time when we get punched, we have a plan that we’re comfortable with.</p>"

    body: "<p>Even a small house fire can have a devastating effect on a homeowner. At the very least, you can have smoke damage throughout your home, including areas that didn’t burn. In more severe fires, you may have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water damage.</li>\n<li>Broken windows</li>\n<li>Holes in your ceiling.</li>\n<li>Damage to your foundation, electrical system, and plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the potential property damage is often compounded by the emotional toll, which explains why homeowners may have a hard time knowing what their next steps should be. We’ve compiled this list of actions you can take if you ever experience a house fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1findasafeplacetostay\">1. Find a Safe Place to Stay</h2>\n<p>You likely won’t be able to stay in your home for some time after a house fire. In fact, you should not go into your house until the fire department gives the okay. This means that you need to find a safe place for you, your family, and any pets to stay. Doing this may require you call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friends or family.</li>\n<li>A hotel.</li>\n<li>A local chapter of the American Red Cross or Salvation Army.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these may be able to help you with temporary housing. You should also note that homeowners insurance often includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> that may pay for a portion of the cost of staying somewhere else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2contactyourinsurancecompany\">2. Contact Your Insurance Company</h2>\n<p>One piece of good news? <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance policies</a> typically cover the physical damage a fire causes, so get in touch with your insurer to get the <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">claims process</a> started ﹘ most have claims information on their websites. Once you’ve filed your claim, your insurance company will assign you a <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> to investigate your damages and assess your loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> While it’s not up to you to determine the cause, you should hold on to the item that you think started the fire. Remember, however, that you shouldn’t enter your home until fire authorities say it’s safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3protectyourhome\">3. Protect Your Home</h2>\n<p>Most insurance policies have a list of duties for the <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a> after a loss. One of these is usually to protect your property from further damage, so you want to do what you can to prevent bad weather or nefarious people from entering your home. In this situation, that most likely means informing the utilities that you had a fire and telling the police that your home may be vacant for a while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getacopyofthefirereport\">4. Get a Copy of the Fire Report</h2>\n<p>Your insurance claims adjuster will most likely want to see the fire report. It’s a public document in most cities, so you should be able to get it from the responding fire department. The fire report usually has important details, such as the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cause of the fire.</li>\n<li>Date the fire occurred.</li>\n<li>Fire department’s arrival time.</li>\n<li>Estimated losses.</li>\n<li>An incident number.</li>\n<li>Type of building.</li>\n<li>Presence of smoke detectors or fire alarms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5dealwithyourfinances\">5. Deal with Your Finances</h2>\n<p>Just because the home is temporarily uninhabitable doesn’t mean you’re off the hook for making mortgage payments. You need to pay these on time and in full while dealing with the claim. The same is likely true of your car payments, and you’ll still have everyday expenses. You may need to contact your bank and credit card companies to make sure you can access your cash.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that your home insurance may pay some of your additional living expenses after a fire, but policies often place <a href=\"/blog/additional-living-expenses-examples/\">limits on what expenses they cover</a>. Keep receipts for anything you buy as you deal with the aftermath of the fire to help you in your claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6replaceyourbelongings\">6. Replace Your Belongings</h2>\n<p>Replacing your personal property is a good step towards getting back to normal, but you’ll need to provide your insurance company with an itemized list of all the belongings lost in the fire. If you didn’t create a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> prior to the fire, keep receipts of anything that you buy to purchase to replace what was lost and give the receipts to your insurance adjuster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7replaceimportantdocuments\">7. Replace Important Documents</h2>\n<p>Any number of important documents may need to be replaced after a fire, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver's licenses.</li>\n<li>Auto registration.</li>\n<li>Property titles and deeds.</li>\n<li>Insurance policies.</li>\n<li>Warranties.</li>\n<li>Military discharge papers.</li>\n<li>Citizenship papers.</li>\n<li>Social security cards.</li>\n<li>Wills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may even be able to replace money that’s been destroyed by sending it to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing or taking it to your regional Federal Reserve Bank. This generally only applies to paper banknotes when more than half of a bill is intact. However, you may be able to replace small portions of banknotes if there’s evidence that shows the rest of the bill has been destroyed</p>\n<h2 id=\"8takecareofyourmentalhealth\">8. Take Care of Your Mental Health</h2>\n<p>Losing your physical belongings in a house fire is traumatic enough, but the experience can also cause emotional upheaval. You want to be on the lookout for <a href=\"https://www.cigna.com/individuals-families/health-wellness/coping-with-loss-due-to-fire\">signs that you or your loved ones need help</a>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tearfulness.</li>\n<li>Insomnia.</li>\n<li>Nervousness.</li>\n<li>A loss of interest in activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the middle of a crisis, focusing on your mental health can be difficult, but it’s important. Be patient with yourself and your family as you recover and consider talking to a therapist to unpack all that you are feeling after the loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionyoumayhaveafterahousefire\">Question You May Have After a House Fire</h2>\n<h3 id=\"shouldyoureplaceyourappliancesafterafire\">Should you replace your appliances after a fire?</h3>\n<p>Talk to your insurance claims representative about replacing your appliances. If the appliance was not directly involved in the fire, you likely only need to have it professionally cleaned and serviced. However, it’s often better to replace them completely if the appliance was involved in the fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifyouaccidentallyburnyourhousedown\">What happens if you accidentally burn your house down?</h3>\n<p>If you accidentally burn your house down, you need to contact your insurance company immediately. Your insurer should be able to tell you whether your damage is covered based on the circumstance and your policy terms. Plus, you have an obligation to report losses, so you're better off alerting your insurance provider.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember after a house fire is that things can be replaced. Quality homeowners insurance can make sure of that.</p>"

    body: "<p>Hi, Kin, my kid is home alone and battling thieves. Does my insurance cover that?</p>\n<h2 id=\"willhomeinsurancesaveyourholidaymaybe\">Will Home Insurance Save Your Holiday? Maybe.</h2>\n<p><em>Dear Kin:</em></p>\n<p><em>Help! I left my child at home for the holidays with no adult supervision. What if he sets elaborate traps for burglars? What if he breaks everything? AM I COVERED?</em></p>\n<p><em>Yours,\nHouse Solitary</em></p>\n<p>Dear House –</p>\n<p>It’s a tale as old as time: you round up your sprawling family for an international holiday trip, only to realize with cold horror in your modest airplane seat that you have in fact left one of your children home. Alone.</p>\n<p>House Solitary, don’t kick yourself too hard. This scenario is clearly ripped from an iconic holiday caper, but let’s do the thought experiment and see how <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> might apply to some mischief only Kevin McCallister could cook up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1battleplans\">#1 Battle Plans</h2>\n<p>Sad but true, traps laid for trespassers (and the subsequent injuries they cause) aren’t covered. Though your home policy’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> can pay for bodily injuries others experience on your property, there’s a big caveat: it won’t cover injuries you (or your child) intentionally cause.</p>\n<p>So, for example, pouring water on the porch steps to purposefully cause slips and falls is not be covered. Of course, it could be hard to prove the steps were purposefully ice covered, but let’s play it safe and not push our luck, right?</p>\n<p>That said, the bandits could still sue you over the injuries, even if they incurred them while doing something illegal like trespassing on your property. This is dependent on where you live, but take note. The law is wild.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2achristmaspartyformannequins\">#2 A Christmas Party for Mannequins</h2>\n<p>Now let’s say your incredibly resourceful offspring rigs up mannequins and life-size cutouts of 90s basketball stars to make your otherwise abandoned home seem full of life. If these animated mannequins get too rambunctious, your home insurance likely won’t cover the damage to your property, but it depends on your policy.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> in your home insurance policy can cover common causes of damage to your belongings, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Windstorms</li>\n<li>Fire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, accidental damage is rarely covered. An exception may be if you opt to <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">schedule your personal property</a>, which can cover perils beyond the ones listed here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3afirecausedbyariggedblowtorch\">#3 A Fire Caused by a Rigged Blowtorch</h2>\n<p>Let’s all take a moment to marvel the fact that Harry’s head tolerated that burn miraculously well. Yikes!</p>\n<p>Now say your wily child managed to create a booby trap that caused a blowtorch to ignite when a door is opened. It’s safe to assume that fire might spread to the rest of the house. Would your insurance help out?</p>\n<p>Not likely because the trap was intentional and well outside the normal use for a blowtorch in the home. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling coverage</a> can often pay for fire damage to a home, but only if that fire stems from normal use (think: an oven fire, a knocked-over candle – that kind of thing). So a fire that started because you misfired while using a blowtorch to make crème brûlée might be covered. A fire that started because of a maniacal scheme to injure a thief? Not so much.</p>\n<p>And there you have it, folks. Stay safe out there and don’t leave your kids unattended this holiday season.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"floodseasonbiggerlongerstronger\">Flood Season: Bigger. Longer. Stronger.</h2>\n<p>Flood season is off to a strong start this year. Late March brought massive flooding to the upper Midwest when warm rain fell on a frozen snowpack. The result was unprecedented – these early spring floods caused $3 billion dollars of damage in Nebraska alone. This early damage to the Midwestern levees in what’s forecast to be a wet spring signals that there may be worse to come.</p>\n<p>Flooding can be hard to predict, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently published its <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/spring-outlook-historic-widespread-flooding-to-continue-through-may\">Spring Flood Outlook</a>, and it’s worth taking a look at, wherever you live in the country. The Mississippi watershed looks particularly colorful on the map, with major flooding risks lining its banks throughout the Midwest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2019-Flooding-Outlook-NOAA.png?width=600&name=2019-Flooding-Outlook-NOAA.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Even if you can’t see a waterway from your front door, it’s important to be aware of elevated risks in your area. As FEMA’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/your-money/hurricane-season-flood-insurance.html\">David Maurstad told the New York Times</a>, “Where it can rain, it can flood.” And our changing climate means that millions of people are now living in higher-risk areas.</p>\n<p>NOAA reports that flooding is more frequent and worse than it used to be. In 2017, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2017_State_of_US_High_Tide_Flooding.pdf\">more than a quarter</a> of locations studied by the NOAA met or broke their high-tide records.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for you? Let’s find out what the new flood season looks like in North America, what you can do to prepare, and how to make sure you have the right insurance coverage for your home.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Where it can rain, it can flood.\"David Maurstad</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whenisthenewfloodseason\">When Is the New Flood Season?</h2>\n<p>Flood season usually aligns with the Atlantic hurricane season: this is historically between June 1st and November 30th. This year’s late March floods are part of an emerging pattern, where flooding happens earlier than it used to and may extend later into the early days of winter.</p>\n<p>Some aspects of flooding haven’t changed much. In spring and summer, flash flooding is still more common as snowmelt from higher elevations adds warm water to the ecosystem. While coastal areas are always at a higher risk of storm surge, flash flooding can be surprising and devastating in places where folks aren’t prepared for heavy rainfall.</p>\n<p>When it comes to changes in rainfall, there’s also cause for concern. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-precipitation\">Precipitation has increased significantly</a> in most of the US since 1901, and precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at a rate of 0.17 inches per decade. That may not sound like much, but it makes a huge difference in the total volume of water falling out of the sky.</p>\n<p>To frame this another way, consider this map of change in precipitation:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/US-Precipitation-Map.png?width=600&name=US-Precipitation-Map.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-precipitation\">Source</a></p>\n<p>Cities and towns experiencing 20 to 30 percent more rainfall face challenges to local infrastructure. For example, if your sewer system isn’t prepared for increased stormwater runoff, homeowners and businesses may see damage from backed-up sewage and flooded streets.</p>\n<p>The impact of this trend isn’t distributed evenly around the country. Folks on the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and in the upper Midwest are experiencing much more dramatic rainfall events than those out on the West Coast.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Rain-Events.png?width=600&name=Rain-Events.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://science2017.globalchange.gov/\">Source</a></p>\n<p>Heavy precipitation is more common and more extreme than it used to be; the US has seen dramatic increases since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Along with this change, flooding is also more frequent. In 2017, <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2017_State_of_US_High_Tide_Flooding.pdf\">more than a quarter</a> of locations studied by the NOAA met or broke their high-tide records. It’s hard to even begin to imagine the scale of the damage being caused, as NOAA estimates that major flooding now costs an average of <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/calculating-cost-weather-and-climate-disasters\">$4.3 billion per event</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NOAA estimates that major flooding now costs an average of $4.3 billion per event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhomefromfloods\">How to Protect Your Home from Floods</h2>\n<p>The national financial impact of recent flooding – this spring has been particularly costly – means state and federal budgets may feel strained, but that doesn’t mean that a flooding event has to empty your personal savings account.</p>\n<p>Make sure you’re well-informed, properly insured, and organized to protect your home or help you recover in the event of a flood. Here are three things you can do to prepare:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1reviewyourfloodmap\">1. Review Your Flood Map</h3>\n<p>When it comes to making sure you have appropriate insurance, recently proposed changes to FEMA maps may impact your flood insurance rates.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s website offers tools like an email subscription option to help homeowners stay on top of their flood status. After flood maps change, you may see one of four things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No change to your flood risk level</strong>. If this is the case, you may want to review your insurance to make sure it’s up to date and aligned with your financial comfort, but there’s other no major action to take.</li>\n<li><strong>Your home may have moved from a low-risk zone to a high-risk zone</strong>. If this is the case and you have a federally regulated mortgage lender, the lender is legally obligated to require that you have flood insurance. Contact your insurer to discuss your options as soon as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Your home may have moved from a high-risk zone to an even higher-risk zone</strong>. If this is the case, your insurance rates may go up. You’ll want to assess what you can do to your property to reduce your insurance rates, if possible, and make sure you have adequate coverage. Contact your insurer for assistance.</li>\n<li><strong>You may have moved from a high-risk zone to a low-risk zone</strong>. If this is the case, can you guess what to do? You should call your insurer to see if you can reduce your coverage, but we don’t recommend cancelling your flood insurance entirely. We’re with FEMA on this one: if you’re covered and you can afford to maintain flood insurance, it’s best to be prepared.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2learnthebasicsoffloodinsurance\">2. Learn the Basics of Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>If you’re wondering, “Does my homeowners insurance cover floods?” you should probably look into <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>While your homeowners insurance may cover some water damage, there are limitations to what your standard home insurance covers.</p>\n<p>Flood insurance covers your home and belongings if they are subjected to storm surges. If you live in a high-risk flood zone or Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), a federally regulated mortgage lender will be legally obligated to require you to have flood insurance to support your homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Flood insurance came to be along with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), created by Congress in 1968 to help mitigate disaster relief. Today you can get flood insurance through the NFIP or through private insurers – and there are more options than there used to be.</p>\n<p>Even if your home is located miles from the nearest water feature, bear in mind that more than <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/why/all-about-flood-maps\">20 percent</a> of flood claims come from outside these high-risk areas.</p>\n<h4 id=\"whyitmatterswherethewatercomesfrom\">Why It Matters Where the Water Comes From</h4>\n<p>One of the major distinctions to understand is the difference between floodwater and groundwater. This matters because not all <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> is covered by your homeowners insurance; it depends in part on where the water came from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groundwater</strong> is the water that sits below ground, between rocks and gravel, traveling through aquifers that supply the majority of Americans with drinking water. Most damage caused by groundwater is not covered by your standard home insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Floodwater</strong> is water that overflows as the result of a flood. Rather than coming up from below your house, floodwater typically starts as heavy rainfall or water from a river that’s breached its banks. To protect yourself from floodwaters, you’ll need flood insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about determining the source of your water damage and the flood claims process, read our guide on <a href=\"/blog/flood-claims-process/\">how flood claims are processed</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3practicaladvicetoprepareforaflood\">3. Practical Advice to Prepare for a Flood</h3>\n<p>It’s important to have the right insurance for your home, but there are additional actions you can take to prepare your property for a possible flood.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep valuables off the ground / out of the basement.</strong> There’s no reason to lose your children’s photos to groundwater or floodwater. If you’re storing irreplaceable items where water might reach them, move those items today.</li>\n<li><strong>Get your utilities off the ground.</strong> If you have the space, elevate your furnace and water heater. Should your basement or yard fill with two feet of water, you can save thousands by having made this adjustment before the water arrives.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/plumbing/sump-pump4.htm\">Prep your sump pump</a>. If you don’t have one, get one to help clear out water in case of a flood.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay attention to the weather.</strong> This may sound obvious, but you shouldn’t take weather alerts for granted. Now that emergency alerts are sent through our cell phones, it’s easier than ever to look at a flood warning as another ping in a list of unread messages.</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarize yourself with the history of flooding on your property.</strong> Do research at your local City Clerk’s office, and ask your neighbors what they know. If there are pictures of folks in old timey hats canoeing down Main Street on the walls of your City Hall, take note. If the dams and waterways in your area haven’t been properly managed, it may flood there again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more advice, consult FEMA’s list of suggestions for how to lower the cost of your flood insurance while maintaining adequate coverage. This includes a more detailed look at how to prepare your property for high water, and this extends all the way up to raising your house on stilts (unlikely to apply to you, but an interesting thought experiment).</p>"

    body: "<p>The new year is fast approaching (and for those of us trying to shake off 2021, not fast enough!). That means it’s time to start looking ahead and dreaming big about the future for your home and family.</p>\n<p>No matter where you are in your homeownership journey – whether you’re a new homeowner or you’re on your third house – setting goals for your household helps you prepare for whatever the coming year may throw at you.</p>\n<p>So make some room on your resolutions list – these are goals for every homeowner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1startanemergencyfund\">1. Start an Emergency Fund</h2>\n<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/41-percent-of-americans-would-be-able-to-cover-1000-dollar-emergency-with-savings.html\">37 percent of Americans</a> do not have a fund to cover a $1,000 emergency and would need to use a credit card for the expense, according to a 2020 Bankrate poll.</p>\n<p>Life is unpredictable and full of unexpected costs. Owning a home is no different. An emergency fund can help you meet hurdles with a plan rather than panic.</p>\n<p>So if you suddenly need to fix a <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-roof-leaks/\">leaky roof</a> or a broken water heater, your fund can help save the day and keep you from putting the expense on a credit card.</p>\n<p>Aim to have six months’ worth of expenses sitting in a savings account, but start somewhere. Sock away any money you get for the holidays. Add a portion of every paycheck to this savings account. Make your emergency fund part of your <a href=\"/blog/how-to-budget-after-buying-a-house/\">household budget</a> in 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2getabetterrateonyourhomeinsurance\">2. Get a Better Rate on Your Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>The new year is a great time to <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">get your finances in order</a>. That also means making sure you aren’t leaving money on the table.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/blog/survey-fl-homeowners-insurance-cost/\">survey found that 40 percent</a> of Florida homeowners don’t know the cost of their home insurance. A surprising 36 percent said they hadn’t shopped for home insurance in more than five years. Both are a recipe for overpaying on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>If it’s been a few years since you’ve shopped around for coverage, request some quotes and see what’s out there. It’s also smart to review your policy and make sure your coverage is up to date with your needs. For example, if you live in a flood-prone area in Florida, it might be time to consider <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3reduceyourenergyconsumption\">3. Reduce Your Energy Consumption</h2>\n<p>Energy bills can be super expensive depending on where you live. Make a goal this year to find small ways to reduce your energy consumption or to consume smarter without sacrificing comfort.</p>\n<p>For example, you might install a smart thermostat that adjusts the temperature of your home at just the right times to save on heating or cooling. Energy Star appliances can help you use less water and less electricity. Or you might simply unplug devices that aren’t in use – it adds up!</p>\n<p>Many utility companies offer a “home energy audit” to show where you use the most energy. Ask for one and make some small adjustments. And here are <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">more other energy saving tips</a> to get you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4shopforahomewarranty\">4. Shop for a Home Warranty</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.inchcalculator.com/appliance-repair-cost-guide/\">average cost of an appliance repair</a> is $175, but costs can often range from $50 to $500. Luckily, these are costs a home warranty can cover.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a <a href=\"/blog/what-is-home-warranty-insurance/\">home warranty</a> or yours expired, it could be a worthy investment. Many are less than $100 a month. In fact, Kin policyholders can save up to 15 percent on a Cinch home protection plan to cover the cost of unexpected breakdowns. All plans offer a 180-day workmanship guarantee on covered repairs.</p>\n<p>When shopping for home warranties, look for a company that has a low monthly contract fee, low trade service fee, and covers as many systems and appliances as possible, including plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5makeanemergencykit\">5. Make an Emergency Kit</h2>\n<p>Natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and tornadoes affect millions of people each year. Prepare an emergency kit in case the day ever comes that your family needs to shelter in place or <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">evacuate</a>.</p>\n<p>Your emergency kit should have enough food and water to last for at least three days. It should also include medications, chargers, maps, emergency radios, flashlights, first-aid supplies, and a copy of important documents like IDs and house deeds. Get more tips in “<a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">How to Make a Disaster Preparedness Plan</a>.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"6refinanceyourmortgage\">6. Refinance Your Mortgage</h2>\n<p>Mortgage interest rates are currently at historic lows, so now’s the time to <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinance your mortgage</a> if you’ve been considering it. Shop interest rates among local banks, credit unions, and internet mortgage brokers. Not only does a lower interest rate save you on monthly payments, but it can also save tens of thousands of dollars in interest payments over the course of the loan.</p>\n<p>Say you have a $300,000 mortgage at 4.5 percent for 30 years. That will cost a total of $547,220, and $247,220 of that is all interest. Dropping your rate to 3.5 percent can save you $173 every month and $62,252 in interest over the course of the loan. It’s worth it to see what you can do to reduce your interest rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7paydownyourmortgage\">7. Pay Down Your Mortgage</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.capitalone.com/bank/money-management/life-events/pay-off-mortgage-or-save/\">According to Capital One</a>, if you have an emergency fund, you’ve <a href=\"/blog/tricks-to-paying-off-credit-cards/\">paid off your credit cards</a>, and you consistently put 10 to 15 percent of your income toward retirement, your next big financial goal should be paying down your mortgage. Paying off your mortgage early can save you thousands of dollars in interest.</p>\n<p>For example, say you have a 30-year mortgage on a $200,000 house with a 4 percent interest rate and you put 10 percent down. If you paid your mortgage off nearly four years early, you could save more than $15,000 in interest charges. To accomplish that, you would need to put about an extra $86 a month toward your mortgage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8minimizebelongings\">8. Minimize Belongings</h2>\n<p>A clutter-free home is easier to manage. Why? You’ll have fewer things to move when you need to clean. Just think about kitchen countertops: you’re more likely to wipe down counters when you don’t have to move vases, salt shakers, and fruit bowls first.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to go all Marie Kondo to <a href=\"/blog/4-ways-to-get-more-organized/\">get more organized</a>, either. Just store things you don’t use frequently and do an honest assessment of what can be donated.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are psychological benefits to reducing stuff around the house. According to Dr. Robert T. Muller in <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/what-can-minimalism-do-mental-health\">Psychology Today</a>, “Materialism is associated with loneliness.” By minimizing, you can focus your energy on experiences and time with friends rather than upkeep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9checkcarbonmonoxideandradondetectors\">9. Check Carbon Monoxide and Radon Detectors</h2>\n<p>You probably know that a carbon monoxide detector can save your life, but when was the last time you tested or replaced that $40 alarm? The last thing you want is a malfunctioning detector.</p>\n<p>Radon is another dangerous gas, and few homeowners have radon detectors. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp\">21,000 lung cancer deaths</a> occur each year because of radon poisoning. Get a radon detector (they’re usually less than $30) to help keep your home safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10makeahomeinventory\">10. Make a Home Inventory</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> is a record of your possessions and a true game changer if you ever make a claim. Because it documents all your belongings, you’ll know exactly what’s missing or damaged after a break-in or a natural disaster. That helps you get replacements faster. Your inventory can also help you make sure you have enough <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">coverage for your personal belongings</a>.</p>\n<p>Your inventory doesn’t have to be all inclusive, either. You can simply snap a few photos of the most valuable items in your home. But if you want extra credit, record your items with their original prices, receipts, serial number, age, and condition in a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>Store a digital copy of your home inventory somewhere safe, and make sure the hard copy is in a fireproof safe or envelope with other important household documents.</p>"

    body: "<p>A lot of homeowners have been conditioned by the health insurance industry to assume that anything more than the absolute minimum amount of insurance will be too expensive. Luckily, the world of homeowners insurance is pretty different from the world of health insurance: Here, “basic” coverage is actually pretty robust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesbasichomeownersinsurancemean\">What does basic homeowners insurance mean?</h2>\n<p>When we talk about basic home insurance, we’re really referring to <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a>. This is the most common type of home insurance, and it covers a wide range of perils that can damage your home, other structures on your property, and even your personal property.</p>\n<p>You don’t want to confuse an HO3 policy with an <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1 policy</a>. An HO1 policy is sometimes called the basic form, but the coverage is so limited that few insurance companies offer them.</p>\n<p>Here are our five favorite coverages that come with your basic homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1personalliabilitycoverage\">1. Personal liability coverage</h3>\n<p>It’s common knowledge that homeowners insurance protects the house itself – the bricks and roof and windows. But even the most basic homeowners policy almost always includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> as well.</p>\n<p>Personal liability can help pay for costs that arise when you injure a guest at your home or damage their property. But here’s the really cool part: it can also pay those expenses if you cause that damage <em>at another location.</em></p>\n<p>That’s right: your basic homeowners personal liability coverage can actually follow you around and keep you protected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2medicalexpensescoverage\">2. Medical expenses coverage</h3>\n<p>Consider this a special subset of the personal liability protection mentioned above. Most basic home insurance policies include a special portion of coverage dedicated to covering only <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical costs</a> associated with injuries your guests sustain at your house (or that you cause people in other places).</p>\n<p>The limits for this portion of your coverage typically aren’t too high, but having that money ready to go in the event of a claim can make life easier for everyone involved – and help you ensure that your guests get the medical attention they need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3lossofuseinsurance\">3. Loss of use insurance</h3>\n<p>You expect your homeowners insurance to pay for a new roof if a tree branch falls on your house. But did you know most basic policies will also <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">cover your living expenses</a> if covered damage makes your home uninhabitable?</p>\n<p>So if you can’t stay in your house because of <em>covered</em> damage (like a fire), your policy can cover the money you have to pay to live somewhere else. Depending on the circumstances, that might include hotel bills, restaurant meals, and even laundry fees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4damagefromappliancerelatedflooding\">4. Damage from appliance-related flooding</h3>\n<p>Unless it’s happened to you, you probably wouldn’t believe the kind of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">damage a small leak</a> from a fridge can cause. In some cases, a leak so small you never noticed it can warp your whole floor and damage the ceiling of the story below, too.</p>\n<p>The good news is that most basic home insurance policies cover this kind of damage. So even if your entire kitchen and basement need to be torn up, dried out, and reinstalled, you may have the funds you need to get the work done and restore your house to its former glory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5replacementcostpropertycoverage\">5. Replacement cost property coverage</h3>\n<p>At Kin, we are big fans of this one. Such big fans, in fact, that we only sell policies with <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">replacement cost property coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works: in the event that your property (furniture, appliances, etc.) is damaged by a covered event, your policy can pay for you to replace it with brand-new equivalent property.</p>\n<p>Translation: If your sofa was new 15 years ago and it gets destroyed in a fire, your replacement cost property insurance can pay for a brand-new sofa of similar quality.</p>\n<p>The alternative, called actual cash value coverage, only pays enough for you to replace your property with something worth the current value of whatever was damaged. (So you’d get enough money to buy a used 15-year-old sofa.)</p>\n<p>Trust us: you want the replacement cost coverage!</p>\n<h2 id=\"findabasichomeinsurancepolicyinminutes\">Find a basic home insurance policy in minutes</h2>\n<p>Ready to enjoy the coverage a basic homeowners policy can offer? Take two minutes to <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">apply for insurance</a>, and get an idea of how little it costs to enjoy all these protections (and more!).</p>"

    body: "<p>Your pets are part of the family. Unfortunately, emergency shelters might turn away your furry, feathers, or finny companions if you don’t take steps well before trouble appears. So today, we kick off Pet Disaster Preparedness Month with top tips on packing a pet emergency kit, evacuating with pets of all kinds, and keeping your pet safe even in dire situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evacuatingwithpets\">Evacuating with Pets</h2>\n<p><strong>Take your pets with you, no matter what disaster you’re facing.</strong> Your pets can’t care for themselves in a hurricane, fire, flood, earthquake, or other emergency. Their survival depends on you.</p>\n<p>An evacuation order means you need to leave as quickly as possible, so your <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> has to include your pet and their emergency gear. Otherwise, you may waste time trying to figure out how to get everyone to safety. You may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find a pet-friendly evacuation shelter.</strong> The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 ensures that state and local emergency planning address the needs of people with pets and service animals. Check if your state has pet-friendly shelters, but you may have to call local motels or ask family members for help.</li>\n<li><strong>Pack a pet emergency kit.</strong> During a <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">mandatory evacuation order</a>, you’ll need at least some supplies so you can care for your pet while you’re away from home.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan for worst-case scenarios.</strong> If you and your pet are separated, you want to have resources on hand that can help you find them, including recent photos, microchip numbers, and registration numbers.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for a temporary caregiver.</strong> Disasters can strike when you’re away from home, so you might want to find a neighbor who is willing to evacuate with your pet if you’re unable to. This person needs to be familiar with your pet and have access to your home. Perhaps find other pet owners in your neighborhood to set up an arrangement.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a list of emergency veterinarians near your shelter.</strong> In case your pet is injured during the disaster,. Be sure to have a couple of animal hospitals on this list in case some aren’t open 24/7.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure your pet is recently vaccinated.</strong> Most emergency shelters will turn away animals that don’t have proof of vaccinations. Keep your pet’s vaccinations up to date, and keep a copy of their vaccination records in your emergency kit.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide comfort.</strong> Emergencies are stressful for animals, too. Bring a sturdy crate to keep your pet safe during transport. When possible, bring their favorite toys to provide comfort and familiarity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Emergency shelters should <a href=\"https://adata.org/service-animal-resource-hub/emergencies\">allow service animals</a>, but make sure that you have their paperwork in your emergency kit. You want to eliminate any doubts about your animal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disasterpreparednesstipsfornontraditionalpets\">Disaster Preparedness Tips for Nontraditional Pets</h3>\n<p>Having a nontraditional pet can make evacuations difficult as shelters and hotels may not allow them. Here are some tips to help you prepare for disaster when you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Birds.</strong> Make sure you have a carrier or travel cage for your birds and that you’re prepared for the weather. This means your pet emergency kit needs a blanket to protect your birds from the cold and a spray bottle with water so you can moisten their feathers when it's hot. Add a catch net, timed feeder, and cage liner while you’re at it.</li>\n<li><strong>Reptiles and amphibians.</strong> While snakes can be transported in a knotted pillowcase, other pets need a sturdy carrier. You also need to bring some sort of heat source, like a blanket, heating pad, or warm water bottle if you can’t use a heat bulb.</li>\n<li><strong>Livestock.</strong> With livestock, it’s even more important to anticipate trouble because you will most likely need to transport them to higher ground. Make sure your horses are well socialized and used to being handled by strangers and practice getting them in your trailer quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Small animals and rodents.</strong> You want to transport hamsters, gerbils, and other small animals in a secure carrier that has a small tube or other hiding spot. Be sure to add their food, extra bedding, and a water bottle to your pet emergency kit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"petemergencykitwhattoinclude\">Pet Emergency Kit: What to Include</h2>\n<p>Assembling a pet emergency kit well before a disaster helps you get out of harm’s way at a moment’s notice while still being sure that you have all the essentials, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 3-day supply (minimum) of pet food in a waterproof container.</li>\n<li>A 3-day supply of bottled water specifically for your pet.</li>\n<li>Bowls.</li>\n<li>A manual can opener.</li>\n<li>A crate or carrier they can comfortably stand in.</li>\n<li>A collar with an ID tag, safety harness, and leash.</li>\n<li>Medical records, proof of registration, and vaccination records in a waterproof pouch.</li>\n<li>A two-week supply of medicine.</li>\n<li>A first-aid kit.</li>\n<li>A photo of you and your pet in case you need additional identification.</li>\n<li>Favorite toys and bedding.</li>\n<li>Waste cleanup supplies.</li>\n<li>An emergency contact list, including veterinarians and nearby shelters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check your emergency kit at least once a year so you can replace expired items and update your pet’s information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourpetduringadisaster\">Protect Your Pet During a Disaster</h2>\n<p>Another key to pet disaster preparedness is learning how to protect your pet in the middle of an emergency. Loud noises can scare an animal that’s already on edge, and dramatically different smells and landmarks can make it hard to find the way home. To keep your pet safe during a disaster, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep pets close to you.</strong> Bring your pet inside at the first sign of trouble to keep them from wandering off. You should also learn how to handle an anxious pet safely, so you’re ready to crate them if you need to.</li>\n<li><strong>Select a safe room to shelter in place.</strong> If you’re not evacuating, find an interior room with few windows for sheltering in place. Remove any chemicals and plants that may be toxic to your pet.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t leave them outside alone.</strong> While your backyard is usually safe for pets, keep in mind that storms may have created escape routes. Worse, the storm might have brought out other dangers for your pets, such as downed trees and damaged power lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t let your pet drink from stagnant water.</strong> Floodwaters can hide a myriad of hazards, including household, medical, and industrial waste, so keep your pets away from it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"additionaltipsforpetdisasterpreparedness\">Additional Tips for Pet Disaster Preparedness</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep a <a href=\"https://secure.aspca.org/take-action/order-your-pet-safety-pack\">rescue alert sticker</a> on your front door to let neighbors and rescuers know your pets are inside and need to be evacuated.</li>\n<li>Keep pet vaccinations up to date.</li>\n<li>Keep your pets leashed when they are not in the home.</li>\n<li>Don’t let your pet drink tap water after a disaster until it’s safe for drinking.</li>\n<li>Microchip your pet and attach an ID tag to their collar so they can be returned to you.</li>\n<li>Know where to search for lost animals, such as local shelters and animal hospitals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t leave your pet to chance during an emergency. A little preparation goes a long way towards getting your entire family﹘animal companions included!﹘through a disaster safe and sound.</p>"

    body: "<p>Most homeowners know that renovations and remodeling can add value to their homes. But what if you could find a project that boosts your home’s worth and makes Fido happy?</p>\n<p>Pets are a part of <a href=\"https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp\">70% of American households</a>, so it makes sense to keep our furry friends in mind when we want to update our homes. These pet-friendly home projects can help protect your home now and be a key selling point for future buyers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteaboutsafety\">A note about safety</h2>\n<p>Even minor renovations can pose some risk to the people and animals living in your house, so you want to take steps to protect them. That starts by finding a trustworthy contractor who works with quality materials. Ask your friends and neighbors for the names of people they’ve worked with on projects, and be sure to check that the people you hire are licensed.</p>\n<p>Even if your contractor uses the best building materials, their work can release dust, particles, and fumes into the air. These can cause respiratory or skin issues for you and your family (pets included!) so you’ll want to keep an eye on them if you’re staying in your home while renovations are underway.</p>\n<p>For your pets, make sure you can recognize the signs of distress. You may even want to look into <a href=\"https://www.metlifepetinsurance.com/how-pet-insurance-works/\">pet insurance and how it works</a> prior to remodeling. That way, you may avoid financial strain if there is a medical emergency.</p>\n<p>Finally, we suggest checking your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> before starting any remodeling project in your home – pet-friendly or not. Major renovations may call for additional coverage.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at a few pet-friendly projects that can add value to your home!</p>\n<h2 id=\"updateyourfloors\">Update your floors</h2>\n<p>Floors are a constant area of concern for homeowners, but adding a pet to the mix ups the ante. Between pet claws and water dishes, floors can take a real beating, but you can minimize the damage by investing in <a href=\"https://floorauthority.com/blogs/tips/best-flooring-for-dogs\">flooring that stands up to pets</a>.</p>\n<p>Tile and vinyl flooring are both good options and come in a variety of colors, textures, and styles that you can customize to fit your home’s aesthetic. Even better? Both tile and vinyl flooring are resistant to various elements and require minimal maintenance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"refreshyourwalls\">Refresh your walls</h2>\n<p>A fresh paint job can give your walls new life, plus it’s one of the more fun projects to take on when remodeling or renovating your home. While we’re big fans of sprucing up your home with the <a href=\"/blog/spruce-up-your-home-with-the-color-of-the-year/\">color of the year</a>, pet owners may want to research a variety of paint types.</p>\n<p>Some paints hold up better against scrapes and are easier to clean. Others may be toxic stains, so you also want to be conscious of what <a href=\"https://www.petplay.com/blogs/tips/how-to-choose-the-right-paint-for-homes-with-pets\">paints are safest to use around pets</a>. It might be worth spending the money for a high-quality, non-toxic paint that doesn’t admit harsh fumes. Look for satin or semi-gloss finishes, as they are less likely to show wear and tear than flat or matte. They are also usually easier to touch up over the years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installbuiltingates\">Install built-in gates</h2>\n<p>Installing built-in and pocket gates around your home is a great addition when you’re concerned about safety. They can be installed next to cabinets in kitchens or in the walkways between rooms, so you can tuck them away until you need them.</p>\n<p>Having gates lets you close off rooms or spaces that you don’t want your pets to access. You can keep them out of the kitchen when you’re busy making dinner or away from a room that you’re cleaning. These added barriers are also very smart for homes with small children as they can double as baby gates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addfencesandlandscaping\">Add fences and landscaping</h2>\n<p>Making changes to your yard with your dog or cat in mind can offer them safety and while also improving the value of your property. A good example of this is fencing, which can create privacy for your family and keep your pets safe in your yard. When you add a fence, you want to take into account the size of your dog or the craftiness of your cat. These will impact both height and materials you use to create a fenced-in area they can’t escape.</p>\n<p>Another pet-friendly project is landscaping your yard so it offers shade for your animals in hot summer months. Just be sure to plant <a href=\"https://www.k9ofmine.com/best-dog-friendly-plants-for-yard/\">pet-safe trees and shrubs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradeyourmudroom\">Upgrade your mudroom</h2>\n<p>Pet-friendly features in your mudroom can make a world of difference when you’re trying to keep your home dirt free. Some options you might want to install include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sink with a high-arc faucet or spray hose.</li>\n<li>A small tiled shower area.</li>\n<li>Shelving or cubbies to hold your pet’s gear, like leashes, coats, toys, and waste bags.</li>\n<li>A built-in kennel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these pet-friendly options have benefits for the humans in your family, too. Deep sinks or shower areas give you a place to hose off mud, and thoughtful storage is always a good idea for keeping your stuff organized.</p>\n<p>Looking for more ways to ensure your pet lives a long and love-filled life?

    body: "<p>Your pet is part of your family. Their home is your home, and chances are you want to make their lives happy and comfortable. A big part of that is taking steps to protect your pet. Here are our 12 tips for making sure your furry, feathery, or finny friends live their best life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getpetinsurance\">1. Get pet insurance</h2>\n<p>Taking care of an animal companion costs money. Just regular veterinarian bills can range from <a href=\"https://www.thezebra.com/resources/personal-finance/average-cost-of-vet-visit-for-dog/#:\">$700 to $1,500 per year</a> for your average dog owner, which is why more pet owners have turned to pet insurance in recent years.</p>\n<p>Pet insurance companies typically determine their rates by looking at your pet’s age, breed, and where they live. These factors can also impact the level of insurance you’ll want to purchase.</p>\n<p>Most pet insurance policies are structured like human health insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard policies include monthly premiums, co-pays, and deductibles.</li>\n<li>There are also coverage limits, typically either annual or for the pet’s lifetime.</li>\n<li>Some policies only cover veterinary care within a specific provider network, while others offer more flexible coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can buy a pet insurance policy that only provides emergency coverage for a low monthly premium, or you can opt for a plan that offers a balance of accident, illness, and wellness coverage.</p>\n<p>While what your pet insurance covers varies by policy, most have the following exclusions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preventative care</li>\n<li>Grooming</li>\n<li>Dental disease</li>\n<li>Hereditary conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the exclusion of preventative care, the main difference between pet insurance and human health insurance is how claims are paid. Unlike our health insurance, pet insurance companies typically require you to pay out of pocket the day of service and then reimburse you once the claim has been processed.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it’s a good idea to have a policy that has a co-pay you can afford and an annual deductible that won’t drain your savings if your pet is involved in a serious accident. A cheap pet insurance policy may not be worth the small monthly premium if the deductible is higher than you can afford to pay out of pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2buydogfriendlyhomeinsurance\">2. Buy dog-friendly home insurance</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e\">personal liability insurance</a> included in your standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> may or may not cover damage caused by your dog. That includes property damage, but the bigger concern is likely dog bites. About <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/dog-bite-prevention\">4.5 million people</a> are bitten by dogs each year.</p>\n<p>Even if you can’t find a dog-friendly home insurance policy, you may be able to get <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability\">animal liability insurance</a>. This protection is essential if someone holds you responsible for their bodily injuries or property damage. Animal liability insurance can help cover the injured person’s medical bills and repair costs.</p>\n<p>While animal liability insurance isn’t required in most states, it’s wise to consider this coverage, especially if you’re a dog owner. It’s hard to predict your dog’s behavior, as different people and circumstances may trigger unforeseen reactions. And dog bite probability isn’t necessarily breed-dependent – even small dogs like Pomeranians can bite unexpectedly.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Studies that examine dog bites by breed note that the <a href=\"https://www.aaha.org/publications/newstat/articles/2019-06/new-study-identifies-most-damaging-dog-bites-by-breed/\">top reason for dog biting was teasing</a>. One way to avoid dog bite incidents is to make sure guests at your home are aware of your dog’s behaviors. Supervise visitor interactions until your dog is comfortable with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3securedoorsscreensandfences\">3. Secure doors, screens, and fences</h2>\n<p>You may not think that Rover would ever want to run away, but it’s pretty common, especially during events like <a href=\"/blog/pets-and-fireworks/\">Fourth of July fireworks</a>. Scared animals often use small openings to escape, so check any outdoor fences or exterior doors for holes or gaps where a small pet might slip (or dig) out.</p>\n<p>Loud noises aren’t the only thing that might put your pet at risk. Some animals are so interested in what’s going on outside that they push their snouts right up against window screens to see and smell everything that they can. It’s awful to imagine a pet falling out of a window, but it happens so often to cats that veterinarians have a name for it: <a href=\"https://pets.webmd.com/cats/guide/cat-high-rise-syndrome\">high-rise syndrome</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4makeapetdisasterplan\">4. Make a pet disaster plan</h2>\n<p>Would you know how to protect your pet if you were facing a tornado, hurricane, or fire? Disasters like these affect thousands of pets every year, but you can help get your animal companion to safety by making a <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet disaster plan</a>. Items in your plan might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting together a pet disaster kit.</li>\n<li>Identifying evacuation shelters that allow animals.</li>\n<li>Finding a reliable temporary caregiver for your pet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5tieupanythingthatcanbepulled\">5. Tie up anything that can be pulled</h2>\n<p>Electrical cords, blinds, and curtains can all be sources of amusement for your cat or dog, until they pose a serious hazard. Your pet can get choked by curtain pulls or suffer a shock if they bite through electrical cords. This is why you want to hide these items or secure them with tiebacks.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to train your pet to leave cords alone. This may take some work, but it goes a long way towards keeping your animal companion safe and healthy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6keeppoisonsawayfromyourpet\">6. Keep poisons away from your pet</h2>\n<p>This may sound extreme, but there are hidden poisons everywhere until you remove them. Find out which <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants\">indoor and outdoor plants</a> aren’t safe for your pet and get rid of them before you find out the hard way.</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to use childproof clips on cabinet doors to protect your pets from cleaning chemicals kept under your sink. While you’re puppy-proofing the area for chemicals, take some time to secure the kitchen trash. There are a lot of human foods that are toxic to animals and you don’t want your pet getting into things he shouldn’t.</p>\n<p>Finally, be thoughtful about where you leave purses and small bags. These look like fun toys to many pets, but they can be full of choking hazards or human medicines that pet bodies just shouldn’t ingest.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> If you think your pet swallowed something poisonous, call the <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\">Animal Poison Control Center</a> at (888) 426-4435. It’s open 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7organizeyourgarageandbasement\">7. Organize your garage and basement</h2>\n<p>The items you store in your garage and basement can be risky in the wrong hands – or paws. You already know that poisons like antifreeze, paint thinners, and lawn care chemicals need to be kept away from your furry friend. But there can be other risks for your furry friends, including metal shards, trash, and batteries.</p>\n<p>Keeping these areas organized is actually a good way to protect your pet. Put hazardous items in plastic storage bins and on high shelves to reduce the chances of Fluffy getting into them. You also want to check the floors for oil spills so you can clean them up quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getapetfirstaidkit\">8. Get a pet first aid kit</h2>\n<p>Just like having a first aid kit for people, having one for your pet can minimize the impact of injuries should your pet experience an injury. You can purchase pet first aid kits online, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals offers a list of items to put in a <a href=\"https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/how-make-pet-first-aid-kit\">do-it-yourself kit</a>. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gauze pads.</li>\n<li>An ice pack</li>\n<li>Adhesive tape.</li>\n<li>Disposable gloves.</li>\n<li>Over-the-counter antibiotic ointment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that injured animals may bite, so only administer first aid if you can do so safely. Some pets may need to be muzzled before you tend to their injuries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9socializeyourpet\">9. Socialize your pet</h2>\n<p>Pets need to be introduced to various situations in order to feel comfortable. This process is called <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/socialization-dogs-and-cats\">socialization</a>, and it usually needs to happen when the pet is very young. If an animal isn’t socialized, it can become fearful and reactive, which increases the chances that they will bite or scratch someone.</p>\n<p>Socializing your dog or cat typically involves exposing it to various experiences. For example, you might take your puppy out for walks where it meets a variety of people and hears different noises, all while providing positive reinforcement with treats or praise. You want to reward your pet’s engagement without forcing them to interact with the new experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10createasafespaceforyourpet\">10. Create a safe space for your pet</h2>\n<p>There are times that your pet wants to be left alone, so it’s important to give them a safe space of their own. For example, many pet owners use crates, kennels, or even certain rooms in their homes as safe spaces for their pets.</p>\n<p>You want your pet to feel comfortable and happy in their safe space, so never use it as punishment. Rather, give them treats or toys that they love while they are in their safe space. That way, your pet will be happy to retreat to their safe space whenever you need to protect them.</p>\n<p>Pet insurance is one way to make sure that your pet gets the care it needs, but as a pet owner, you also want to keep your pet safe from harm. Taking steps to protect your pet goes a long way towards curbing vet bills and liability claims.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you’re a pet parent, you know furry friends are usually not amused by <a href=\"/blog/firework-damage-homeowners-insurance/\">fireworks</a> – in fact, most are downright terrified of them. Take a moment to consider the spectacle from their vantage point: unexplained bursts of bewildering light. The crashing BOOM as fireworks explode overhead. The smoke and smell of gunpowder lingering long after the display fades back into night. Factor in the cheers and applause from a crowd, and you have a recipe for sensory overload.</p>\n<p>It’s no wonder that more pets go missing on the Fourth of July than any other day of the year. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/news/fourth-july-celebrate-pet-safety\">20 percent of pets go missing</a> after being scared by loud noises, according to the ASPCA.</p>\n<p>Even pets who aren’t typically prone to anxiety can be scared of the loud noises brought on by fireworks. If your pet is fearful or anxious, they may pace, pant, tremble, hide, salivate, growl, or whine.</p>\n<p>So what can we do to make our companions more comfortable while we celebrate? Here are some tips to keep your four-legged loves safe as the Fourth of July approaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1keeppetsawayfromfireworks\">1. Keep Pets Away from Fireworks</h2>\n<p>Fireworks are dangerous, full stop. They sent <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2019-Fireworks-Annual-Report.pdf?La_ZzaoEeI_FXhMNJSoIyO8BhrBbcA4B\">10,000 people</a> to the ER for injuries in 2019, and 58 percent of those injuries were burns. But animals get hurt, too. According to the ASPCA, every Fourth of July, Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) sees an uptick in calls over pets who have ingested fireworks, which are full of chemicals and heavy metals.</p>\n<p>So don’t risk your pet’s emotional or physical wellbeing by letting them around fireworks. Keep them safely indoors, and make sure they don’t go outside unattended. You don’t want the loud noises to cause them to bolt. If you can’t leave your pet at home, keep them leashed and under your supervision.</p>\n<p>If you set off fireworks at home, thoroughly clean up so your curious pup doesn’t eat the remnants. If your pet does ingest fireworks, <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\">contact Animal Poison Control</a> or take your pet to the emergency vet right away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2registeryourpetsmicrochip\">2. Register Your Pet’s Microchip</h2>\n<p>If your fur baby gets loose on the Fourth, a registered microchip can make a world of difference in how quickly you reunite. So if you haven’t already, this is your sign to get your pet microchipped and registered. Microchipping costs about $45 at most vet offices. Registering the microchip at a pet recovery database costs around $20 a year. Be sure to keep the database up to date with your most recent contact information, including your address and phone number.</p>\n<p>These are some of the most common pet recovery databases where you can register the microchip:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://microchipregistry.foundanimals.org/\">Found Animals</a> (this one is free)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homeagain.com/\">HomeAgain</a> (most popular)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.akcreunite.org/\">AKC Reunite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.petlink.net/us/welcome\">PetLink</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.24petwatch.com/US/\">24PetWatch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marrsmicrochip.com/\">ACA's Microchip Animal Rapid Recovery Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homewardboundpet.com/\">Homeward Bound Pet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://petkey.org/\">Petkey</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an extra precaution, you might want to make sure your pets are wearing collars with ID tags in case they make a desperate attempt to escape the noise. ID tags should have the name of your pet, your address, and your phone number.</p>\n<p>If your pet does go missing, contact local animal shelters, animal control, and your vet. You can also report your lost pet on the microchip registry.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">Pet Disaster Preparedness: Keep Your Pets Safe in an Emergency</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keepyourpetspleasantlydistracted\">3. Keep Your Pets Pleasantly Distracted</h2>\n<p>Fireworks are jarring, but the easy viewing of Animal Planet may be just what your stressed pooch needs to keep their mind off the chaos outside. Turning on some music or TV can help soften the intermittent noises from fireworks and ease the effect for your pets.</p>\n<p>If you don’t plan on going out for celebrations that night, you can curl up with your favorite fur friend and give them a pet of reassurance when the noise gives them a fright.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4askyourvetforhelp\">4. Ask Your Vet for Help</h2>\n<p>If your companion has serious anxiety, it might be worthwhile to explore some treatments at the direction of your vet. For example, your vet may recommend trying a <a href=\"https://thundershirt.com/\">Thundershirt</a>, which applies pressure to the chest and helps ease anxiety for many noise-averse pets. If you don’t have one, a snug t-shirt may do the trick.</p>\n<p>Your vet may also recommend anti-anxiety medication, depending on the severity. Your vet may suggest you give a trial dose to see how your pet does before the Fourth of July. Remember that pets have a very different tolerance for medications than humans, and you should administer the medication exactly as your vet prescribes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5watchoutforheatstroke\">5. Watch Out for Heat Stroke</h2>\n<p>With record highs sweeping the US, you probably don’t need us to remind you how dangerous the heat can be for your four-legged pals (and humans, for that matter). That’s yet another reason to keep your pets safely inside during the Fourth of July: you don’t want to run the risk of heat stroke. If your pet must be outside, make sure they have ample access to shade and water, and keep an eye out for these signs of heat stroke:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive panting.</li>\n<li>Increased heart rate.</li>\n<li>Confusion or disorientation.</li>\n<li>Vomiting or diarrhea.</li>\n<li>Bright red gums.</li>\n<li>Body temperature higher than 104° F.</li>\n<li>Collapse, seizure, or coma.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that hot pavement can burn your pup’s paws, so if you can’t hold your hand on the ground for five seconds, it’s not safe for your dog’s sweet feet either.</p>\n<p>Don’t leave your pet in a parked car, even if it doesn’t seem that warm. No matter how cool it may seem outside, temperatures in closed vehicles can climb to 116 degrees in less than an hour, which can be fatal.</p>\n<p>There you have it, friends. Have a safe and happy 4th, and give your dogs a hug for us.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howtowinterizeyourhome\">How to Winterize Your Home</h2>\n<p>Winter can be harsh even on homes in warmer regions, like Florida. Not to mention, leaks in the attic or uninsulated pipes can lead to high energy bills that put a damper on the holiday season and your money-saving resolutions in the coming year.</p>\n<p>Use these tips to prep your home for winter – your home and bank account will thank you!</p>\n<h3 id=\"1sealatticairleaks\">1. Seal Attic Air Leaks</h3>\n<p>One of the top tasks on your <a href=\"/blog/fall-home-maintenance/\">fall home maintenance checklist</a> is caulking your windows, but you don’t want to stop there. Air leaks in your attic can have a significant impact on how well your house retains heat. According to HouseLogic, up to <a href=\"https://www.houselogic.com/organize-maintain/home-maintenance-tips/fixing-attics-air-leaks/\">30% of a home’s heating and cooling</a> is lost because of air leaks.</p>\n<p>When looking for leaks, pay attention to gaps of all sizes, from those that are bigger than 1/4-inch, which require more than just caulking, to sealing small cracks around your chimney and flues.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to weatherstrip the attic access door. House Logic suggests caulking between the hatch frame and the rough opening or installing foam weatherstripping around the hatch opening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2installasmartthermostat\">2. Install a Smart Thermostat</h3>\n<p>Did you know that the average single-family home can <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/products/heating_cooling/programmable_thermostats/proper_use_guidelines\">save approximately 8%</a> on their heating and cooling cost just by installing a programmable thermostat? A thermostat that can be programmed allows you to save money because you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-set times for turning the heater on and off.</strong> No more forgetting in the morning and then running the heat all day.</li>\n<li><strong>Set heating zones around the house.</strong> Now you can heat only the areas you use most, rather than keeping that guest bedroom warm all winter long with no visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onset of winter is the perfect time to install a new thermostat. Check out PC Mag’s ranking of the <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/g00/article/356755/the-best-smart-thermostats\">best smart thermostats</a> to find the right option for your home.</p>\n<p>While you’re at it, set the thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit for your most energy-efficient home. If you get cold at 68 degrees, plan on wearing socks and a sweater in the house. This helps keep you warm and in the cozy winter spirit. It also allows your home to not suck up too much energy while trying to heat it. This will do your part to help the environment too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3washallyourblankets\">3. Wash All Your Blankets</h3>\n<p>Washing blankets every few months is a good seasonal habit to form, especially as colder months approach. You may not have used many of your heavy blankets yet, but all blankets – not just your comforter – easily collect bacteria, pet hair, allergens, and dirt particles. Give everything a good wash before it gets too cold, so you have fresh, clean blankets to start the winter.</p>\n<p>This is especially important to do before holiday guests arrive. You don’t want to inadvertently pass along germs to your visitors!</p>\n<p>Run the washer and dryer at specific times of the day to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce your energy consumption</a>. The best times of day are the early morning (before 7 a.m.) or late at night when there is lower energy consumption in the house. This will help you avoid any energy surges. During the winter, the highest electricity demand is between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., when people are heating their homes as they get ready for their day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4insulateyourpipes\">4. Insulate Your Pipes</h3>\n<p>As hot water flows through cold pipes, they cool the water and waste heat. To avoid this wasted warmth, insulate the pipes between the hot water heater and the wall, and the first three feet of cold water pipes after they enter the house.</p>\n<p>This is easier to do than you might think. Perhaps the simplest method is to use snap-on insulating sleeves (think: pre-slit, hollow-core, flexible foam pipe insulation) at hardware stores. Just measure your pipes’ diameters before you shop.</p>\n<p>The other big benefit to insulating pipes is that it can dramatically reduce your chances of filing an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>. Insulation <a href=\"/blog/how-to-keep-pipes-from-freezing/\">keeps your pipes from freezing</a>, and that reduces the chances of them bursting and causing major water damage to your walls or floors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5trimbacktreesandbranches\">5. Trim Back Trees and Branches</h3>\n<p>Even if you live in an area that doesn’t get snow, it’s still smart to <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">trim trees</a> and cut back branches that are too close to your power lines and house. All it takes is one storm for those branches to cause trouble.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, what might happen if a branch from your tree fell on your roof. Or worse, what if it fell on your neighbor’s house? Fortunately, both situations are typically covered by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. However, your better option is to avoid problems altogether by keeping your trees healthy.</p>\n<p>For more home maintenance tips, check out “<a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">7 Signs It’s Time to Replace Your Roof</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in November, 2019.

    body: "<p>We’ve looked at how your homeowners insurance doesn’t cover household employees before. In this article, we go into a little more detail about what you need to know about insurance when you hire a maid or house cleaning service.</p>\n<p>The short version: you may have insurance needs beyond your basic homeowners policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverhousecleaners\">Does home insurance cover house cleaners?</h2>\n<p>We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: Coverage for just about anything depends mainly on the language in your policy.</p>\n<p>That said, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> may cover damage your cleaner causes. For example, say your home cleaning service uses the wrong solution and ruins your hardwood floors. Your insurance may cover your claim if the situation fits the details in your policy.</p>\n<p>But it may be a very different story if someone from the cleaning service gets hurt while working on your house.</p>\n<p>If a guest at your home got hurt and required medical treatment, the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical expenses</a> portion of your homeowners insurance would likely cover the bills. But because a maid or house cleaner is someone you pay to come to your house – a domestic employee, technically – insurance companies don’t usually consider them visitors or guests and so don’t pay for their injuries.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some homeowners policies provide a limited amount of coverage for business activities, and some insurers offer additional coverage through <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Read your policy carefully or talk to your agent to figure out if you have sufficient coverage for your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-nanny-or-gardener/\">domestic employees</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatinsurancedohousecleanersneed\">What insurance do house cleaners need?</h2>\n<p>To properly protect themselves, their employees, and their clients, house cleaners should have general liability coverage and workers compensation insurance. In some cases, these different types of coverage may be combined in a single business owner policy (BOP).</p>\n<p>Like all workers, injured maids and house cleaners can tap into workers’ compensation benefits to cover the medical bills associated with illnesses and injuries they sustain on the job. So when a maid gets hurt while cleaning your home, workers’ compensation insurance should pay the cost of their medical bills and (if the injury prevents them from working) lost salary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whopaysforhousecleanersworkerscompensationinsurance\">Who pays for house cleaners’ workers compensation insurance?</h2>\n<p>The answer depends on a few factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you live</li>\n<li>How many hours per month maid works in your home</li>\n<li>How you hire your maid or house-cleaning service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first two are actually related: workers’ comp laws exist at the state level, which means that they’re different throughout the country. Many states have special requirements for domestic employees, who often work only a few hours per month at any given employer.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.care.com/homepay/resource-center/requirements-by-state/california\">California homeowners are required to carry workers' comp</a> for their household employees. In <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina</a>, they aren't.  And in <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida</a>, homeowners must get workers’ compensation only if they have four or more domestic employees.</p>\n<p>If you don’t feel like learning the ins and outs of workers’ comp insurance, you can choose to hire your maid or house cleaning service through an agency that provides the appropriate coverage. In this arrangement, the cleaners are often employees of the agency, so the agency is responsible for carrying the policy.</p>\n<p>But if you do go the agency route, be sure to ask for proof of insurance before your maid’s first day of work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shouldhousecleanersbeinsured\">Should house cleaners be insured?</h2>\n<p>Any person hiring someone to perform work – even domestic work like cleaning a home – should make sure the businesses or individuals they employ are properly insured. In the case of house cleaners, homeowners need to check that their cleaners are properly bonded and insured.</p>\n<p>In your home, an injured maid or house cleaner who doesn’t have access to the benefits from a workers’ comp policy could sue you to cover the cost of their medical bills. Lawsuits cost time and money; workers’ comp insurance, on the other hand, is pretty affordable.</p>\n<p>To understand why coverage is so important, it’s helpful to have a little background on workers’ comp. This coverage was developed as a “grand bargain” between employers and employees to incentivize safer workplaces and to prevent employees from suing their bosses if they got hurt.</p>\n<p>With workers’ comp in place, any employee who gets hurt on the job has a reliable source of funds to pay for their medical bills and lost wages related to the injury, but gives up the right to sue over workplace injuries (in most cases). Employers are able to pay the relatively small cost of insurance premiums and avoid the potentially huge cost of an injured employee suing them for not providing a safer workplace.</p>\n<p>Curious about the limits of your homeowners coverage? Read about <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-my-home-insurance-policy/\">what's in your homeowners insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in October 2018.

    body: "<p>One of the most common misconceptions about <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina home insurance</a> is that it covers any damage that happens to your home. Flooding is a good example of this. Few, if any, homeowners policies cover water damage if it’s caused by a flood.</p>\n<p>For many homeowners, especially those living in flood areas in South Carolina, that means two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to take steps to guard against flooding.</li>\n<li>You may need an additional flood insurance policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can you protect your home against all of nature’s unpredictabilities? Probably not. But you can reduce their impacts through risk mitigation and insurance – and that starts with identifying your particular risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at South Carolina flood zones so you can protect your home from flooding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherearethefloodareasinsouthcarolina\">Where are the flood areas in South Carolina?</h2>\n<p>Floods damage is a real possibility for most of the Palmetto State. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has found “flood-prone areas in every county, city, and town” across the state, according to the department’s <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/SCQG_FloodplainManagement.pdf\">guide to floodplain management</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, people living closer to the coast are more vulnerable to the very dangerous flood that comes during South Carolina hurricane season, like the Beaufort county SC flood zones. Other coastal counties in South Carolina that are susceptible to flooding include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charleston.</li>\n<li>Berkeley.</li>\n<li>Colleton.</li>\n<li>Dorchester.</li>\n<li>Georgetown.</li>\n<li>Horry.</li>\n<li>Jasper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the only places where floods can occur, but the high risk for potentially catastrophic flooding makes them worth a special mention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzones\">Flood zones</h3>\n<p>Up until now, we’ve referenced flood areas in a fairly general way, but South Carolina residents also need to know about <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) labels certain areas as flood zones based on the degree of flooding that’s likely to occur.</p>\n<p>You can find out if your home is in a flood zone by visiting the <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search\">FEMA Flood Map Service Center</a> and entering your address. For example, we searched Beaufort SC flood zones and found that much of the county is either <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">VE</a>. The same was true on the Charleston, SC, flood zone map.</p>\n<p>Both AE and VE flood zones have a high risk of flooding, but the reasons for the risk are different. Flood Zone AE indicates the area is near floodplains, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water. Flood Zone VE are usually coastal areas where homeowners also face the risk of storm surge.</p>\n<p>Either way, FEMA designates these and other flood zones as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Homes in an SFHA have a 26% chance of experiencing a flood during a thirty-year mortgage, so owners typically have to get flood insurance in order to get federally backed loans.</p>\n<p>While the risk for floods is greater in some places, you should note that flooding can happen almost anywhere. FEMA estimates that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/faq/low-risk-flood-zones\">25% of flood claims</a> are from areas with low-to-moderate flood risk. Worse? Some question if <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-maps/\">FEMA flood maps are accurate</a>, in part because they don’t account for climate change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtohardenyourhomeagainstfloodinginsouthcarolina\">How to Harden Your Home Against Flooding in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>The homes, people, and businesses in the flood areas in South Carolina may be impacted every year by excessive rainfall, overflowing rivers, storm surges, and more. According to the <a href=\"https://riskfactor.com/state/southcarolina/45_fsid/flood\">most recent information from Risk Factor</a>, there are more than 358,000 properties that are at risk for experiencing floods. That number is only expected to increase each year as sea levels rise and more people move to the state.</p>\n<p>Getting the right insurance is essential to recovering from South Carolina flood damage, but you also want to think about how you can minimize it in the first place. Some steps you can take include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Elevating your systems.</strong> Some flood zones have <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevations</a> (BFE), or the height water is expected to rise during flooding. If your area has a BFE, you may want to make sure your electrical systems and furnace are above it.</li>\n<li><strong>Updating your flooring.</strong> Switching from carpeting to tile may reduce the amount of damage you see in a flood.</li>\n<li><strong>Floodproofing your basement.</strong> A sump pump is one option, but you may also want to seal the walls of your basement with waterproof compounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing windows and doors.</strong> Make sure these are tightly sealed with caulk. While you're at it, check for gaps anywhere pipes or wires enter your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Directing water away from your foundation.</strong> Probably the easiest way to do this is to position rain spouts so the water runs towards your yard, but you could also make sure your landscaping slopes away from your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips, read our article <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\"><em>6 tips to minimize your risk of flood and water damage</em></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodinsuranceinsouthcarolinafaqs\">Flood insurance in South Carolina: FAQs</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, we do not currently offer flood insurance in South Carolina. But as a home insurance company dedicated to bringing coverage to people in catastrophe-prone areas, we know how important it is for our members to have the information they need to protect their homes. The following answers to some of the most common questions about flood insurance in South Carolina will hopefully help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doineedfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">Do I need flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>It depends! While your mortgage company may require you to get flood insurance if you’re in a SFHA, you may still want coverage. In SC, flooding areas are abundant, and most homeowners policies don’t provide financial protection against flood loss. The likelihood of floods, and the damage they can cause, makes flood insurance a good idea for most people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howmuchisfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">How much is flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The cost of flood insurance depends on several factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your flood zone.</li>\n<li>The design and age of your home.</li>\n<li>Whether or not your utilities are elevated.</li>\n<li>The amount of coverage you want.</li>\n<li>The deductible you choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many homeowners get their flood coverage from FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program, but some opt for private flood insurers. Both can end up saving them money in the long run because they save homeowners from dipping into their personal savings to make repairs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyshouldigetfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">Why should I get flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>Life is unpredictable, and insurance provides protection for those unexpected instances that cause loss. No one wants their home to flood, but it’s seldom up to us. Flood insurance can provide significant financial relief if your home is subject to catastrophic flooding, especially a last-minute <a href=\"/blog/what-is-flash-flooding/\">flash flood</a>, by giving you the ability to quickly return to your usual way of life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"willhomeownersinsurancecoverflooddamageduringahurricaneinsouthcarolina\">Will homeowners insurance cover flood damage during a hurricane in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>Homeowner’s insurance policies generally exclude the type of water damage caused by hurricane storm surge. That’s why flood insurance is so important in areas along South Carolina’s coast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdofloodsoccurinsouthcarolina\">How do floods occur in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The main culprits of South Carolina inland flooding is the state’s hot, humid environment and low-lying landscape. Riverine overflows also contribute to the number of flood areas in South Carolina, threatening the safety of more inland homes. And as a coastal state, South Carolina is also at risk for storm surge during hurricane season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h3>\n<p>Understanding what your home insurance covers and what it excludes is key to making sure you have the right protection. For most South Carolina homeowners, flood damage falls in the category of “not covered.” That’s only tragic if you don’t take steps to protect your home.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the steps you need to take aren’t difficult: Identify your flood risk, harden your home against damage, and get flood insurance. Will any of those prevent floods? No. But they can make it easier to recover should you find yourself facing the worst-case scenario.</p>"

    body: "<p>There’s no question that your space affects your mood. That’s why it can feel so good to come home after a long day and curl up on your couch. Understanding the psychology of interior design can help you choose elements that beautify your home while also lifting your mood and supporting your wellbeing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthepsychologyofinteriordesign\">What Is the Psychology of Interior Design?</h2>\n<p>Interior design psychology is the study of how people interact with the spaces around them and how the elements of those spaces impact their emotional wellbeing. These elements can include anything from light and color to textures and open spaces, and all of which play a role in how we feel in our environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lightdesignandyourmood\">Light Design and Your Mood</h2>\n<p>Light, particularly natural light, has a dramatic impact on your mood. Health experts have found that <a href=\"https://www.tricitymed.org/2018/08/5-ways-the-sun-impacts-your-mental-and-physical-health/\">exposure to sunlight raises serotonin</a>, a chemical your body produces that helps reduce anxiety and depression, which may lead you to choose translucent curtains or add a skylight in a room.</p>\n<p>Allowing natural light to shine through windows can brighten your mood, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use artificial light, too. You just want to choose the type of light bulb that’s appropriate for the function of the area and the mood you’re trying to create.</p>\n<p>Designers will often use brighter lighting in workspaces﹘the places where you need to see what you’re doing, like your kitchen. But you can choose softer lighting to create a more relaxed feeling in other spaces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"colorchoicesimpactemotions\">Color Choices Impact Emotions</h2>\n<p>You may be familiar with color psychology as something advertisers use to influence consumers, but homeowners can also use it in various rooms to evoke a feeling, encourage conversations, or even make a room feel bigger.</p>\n<p>Blues and grays, for example, are popular in living rooms because of their calming effect. In areas where you want more energy, stimulating colors like red and yellow get used more often. This is especially important in areas where people gather such as kitchens and family rooms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"balancingcomfortfunctionandspace\">Balancing Comfort, Function, and Space</h2>\n<p>People tend to feel less anxious in a room when the furniture is arranged in a way that’s both pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate. But people usually want sofas and chairs that are comfortable and inviting. That can be a hard balance to strike, especially when you’re talking about size. A big, comfy couch may call your name in the store, but it might overwhelm your living room once you bring it home.</p>\n<p>The trick with furniture is to find the balance between something that is comfortable and something that doesn’t take over the space, making it feel small. Luckily, current <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design trends</a> include minimalism in the form of Japandi and maximalism. While these trends have distinctly different looks, either can support your mood depending on your personality. The multitude of colors and textures on top of big, cozy furniture you find in maximalism could be just the thing for someone who desires comfort. But if that look feels cluttered to you, then you may want to consider the clean lines of minimalism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingspacewithorganization\">Creating Space with Organization</h2>\n<p>People tend to be happier and more creative in spacious areas. But for those of us who don’t have tons of square footage and vaulted ceilings, we can create a sense of space with smart organization.</p>\n<p>Organization should be a key element in the design of every room in your house. The first step is to arrange your furniture so that it encourages interaction and allows people to move around it easily. However, clutter can ruin the spaciousness your layout creates, so the next step is to remove as much clutter as you can. Everything should have a place in your home. That may mean getting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Files systems to deal with the paper in the home office.</li>\n<li>Drawer organizers and utensil holders for your kitchen.</li>\n<li>Bins and baskets to corral kids toys and games.</li>\n<li>Furniture with built-in storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When everything has a place to go, it's easier to find what you're looking for.</p>"

    body: "<p>Few events create as much excitement as bringing a new puppy into your home. That little ball of fur will have you wrapped around its paw in no time! But while a puppy’s energetic antics are often endearing, the combo can make your new pupper a less-than-ideal housemate.</p>\n<p>If you have a new puppy or plan to get one soon (lucky!), you're going to want to puppy proof your living space. Here are our top puppy proofing tips to keep you, your dog, and all of your loved ones healthy and safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"socializeyourpuppy\">Socialize your puppy</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do for your new pup is to socialize it. You want your dog to be comfortable in new environments, and socialization is the key. “Socializing” simply means teaching your dog how to behave with other people and animals, and you can do it by exposing your puppy to new situations.</p>\n<p>Almost everything is new for a puppy, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities for socialization. For example, a walk around your neighborhood may lead to interactions with senior citizens and children alike. A puppy playdate might give your new dog a chance to walk on hardwood floors. All of these can improve your doggo’s confidence and behavior.</p>\n<p>Good socialization makes your dog less likely to act aggressively even when it's afraid. Some <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> covers damages if your dog hurts someone outside of your family, but you need to check your policy. Lots of states require you to add <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"createasafeplacetoexplore\">Create a safe place to explore</h2>\n<p>Your new puppy is a bundle of curiosity, and investigating the world is an important part of socialization. However, you want to make sure your pup is protected as it explores. Doors leading to the outside or to risky areas (e.g., a basement) need to be closed, and stairs should be blocked with a baby gate.</p>\n<p>The ideal situation for exploring the outdoors is a yard with a fence that your dog can’t jump over, squeeze through, or dig under. If that’s not possible, then you want to always have your dog on a leash, even in your yard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closewindowsandfixscreens\">Close windows and fix screens</h2>\n<p>Your puppy’s powerful sniffer may lead it to investigate breezes coming in from outside, so you want to make sure that you either close your windows or that your screens are in good repair. The idea that a beloved but nosey pet might fall from a window is tragic, but veterinarians treat victims of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119028994.ch162\">high-rise syndrome</a> all the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"securecords\">Secure cords</h2>\n<p>While you're checking your windows and screens, take a look at your curtains and blinds. Puppies like to pull anything that can be pulled, and that includes cords of all kinds. You may be able to puppy proof these by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tying up the excess.</li>\n<li>Cutting the loop in the cord so it’s not a choking hazard.</li>\n<li>Adding a hook to the wall to secure them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Electrical cords can also be a problem. You may be able to hide them in cord concealers or behind furniture that your puppy can’t access. Another option is to use a deterrent spray on exposed cords to discourage your puppy from playing with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeharmfulplacesofflimits\">Make harmful places off-limits</h2>\n<p>Puppies learn about the world around them using all of their senses, including taste. That means they’re likely to use their mouths to pick up all sorts of harmful items. Take a look at your home from that point of view, and you’ll see lots of areas that should be off-limits to Fido. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your garage.</li>\n<li>Your basement.</li>\n<li>Under sinks.</li>\n<li>Sheds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you store chemicals like antifreeze, cleaning solutions, and fertilizer or sharp tools in any of these places, then you want to minimize your pup’s access to them. Think, too, about trash cans under the sink or in your backyard. You may see this as just garbage, but your dog can find the smell irresistible, so make sure you have secure lids.</p>\n<h2 id=\"storemedicationssafely\">Store medications safely</h2>\n<p>Keeping medications out is handy for you, but your new puppy will find more ways to climb up a kitchen counter or nightstand then you can imagine. Play it safe and puppy proof all your medications in a medicine cabinet that is well out of the reach of your pup.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> You might also want to store your pet’s medication in a place other than yours. Not only does that help you avoid mix-ups, but it may limit Rover’s interest in your meds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnabouttoxicplants\">Learn about toxic plants</h2>\n<p>Chemicals and medicines aren’t the only things your puppy might eat that can be harmful. Both indoor and outdoor plants may be poisonous, too. Take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants?field_toxicity_value%5B%5D=01\">list of toxic plants</a> from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Once you know, then you can either put your plants out of your pupper’s reach or get rid of them altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepbatteriesawayfrompuppies\">Keep batteries away from puppies</h2>\n<p>Like we said, puppies like to chew just about everything. That’s annoying on its own, but it can turn dangerous if your dog gets its mouth on something with a battery. While your dog is young, put your key fobs, remote controls, and other battery-operated items on high shelves.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Always have your veterinarian’s number on hand as well as the <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\">ASPCA’s poison control hotline</a> at 888-426-4435.</p>\n<p>Puppy proofing your home is an important part of getting a new dog, but what do you do in an emergency situation? Check out our <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet disaster preparedness tips</a> for answers.</p>"

    body: "<p>Buying a home is an exciting time, but it also comes with a lot of stress. After all, you’re investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a property – and weighing at least as many details: Are there termites? Does the sewer back up? What are the HOA fees?</p>\n<p>The pressure’s on to get it right, so we talked to real estate experts to find out what questions to ask when buying a house. Read on or click below to skip to the topic you’re most interested in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#questions-to-ask-about-cost-and-budget\">Cost and Budget</a> | <a href=\"#questions-to-ask-about-the-people-youll-work-with\">People You’ll Work With</a> | <a href=\"#questions-to-ask-about-the-houses-risks\">History & Risks</a> | <a href=\"#questions-to-ask-about-the-houses-condition\">Home’s Condition</a> | <a href=\"#questions-to-ask-about-the-neighborhood\">The Neighborhood</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"questionstoaskaboutcostandbudget\">Questions to ask about cost and budget</h2>\n<p>For many people, a house is the biggest purchase of their life, which means you should ask a lot of questions about what you're getting before you make an offer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1whataremytotalcosts\">1. What are my total costs?</h3>\n<p>Unless you’re paying cash, the sticker price of a house is not the actual amount you pay. And even if you are paying cash, there are usually ongoing costs you should consider to make sure your home fits in your budget. And one more note: you won’t usually know the final cost upfront because of the many unknowns that go into this process. But you can get a ballpark.</p>\n<p>Typically, a house’s “total” cost includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The property itself.</strong> This is the big fat number you’ll see listed on Zillow or Redfin. But be sure to consider the cost of both your down payment and your monthly payments. Shaun Martin of <a href=\"https://webuyhousesindenver.org\">WeBuyHousesinDenver</a> says “Cash reserves are king because it means that if you lose your job or hit a financial hurdle, you can still afford to pay the mortgage.” He recommends keeping three to six months of expenses on hand on top of what you pay for the property</li>\n<li><strong>An appraisal.</strong> One of the first expenses associated with buying a house, an <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> amounts to an expert evaluation of the property’s value. Expect to pay several hundred dollars on this.</li>\n<li><strong>An inspection.</strong> The <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a> evaluates the condition of your future home. More thorough than an appraisal, its goal is to identify anything that’s not in good working order (and therefore might cost you a lot of money in the near future).</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage interest.</strong> When you borrow money to buy your house (i.e., take on a mortgage), you pay for the privilege in the form of mortgage interest. Over the lifetime of your loan, your interest rate can have a significant difference on the total amount you pay for your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage insurance.</strong> Certain types of mortgages require smaller down payments, and that sometimes means you may have to pay <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a> every month.</li>\n<li><strong>Homeowners insurance.</strong> If you have a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to get a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a>. And even if you don’t, you’ll likely want a policy to protect your possessions and assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Taxes.</strong> You’ll pay property taxes every year, though often on a monthly basis, rolled in with your mortgage payment. They cover things like local schools, road maintenance, and other essential services in your area. Make sure they’re in line with the taxes on other properties in the neighborhood. The current homeowner is probably your best source of tax information.</li>\n<li><strong>HOA fees.</strong> Not every house has a homeowners association (HOA), but they’re gaining popularity, and <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-fees/\">HOA fees</a> can pay for anything from maintaining a communal swimming pool to trash removal for the community. According to Terri Williams and Realtor.com, a typical HOA fee comes in at around <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/homeowners-guide-to-hoas-homeowners-associations\">$200 to $300 per month</a> – but they can also be much higher for extreme luxury properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to knowing which questions to ask before buying a house, it helps to understand where you can use your bargaining skills to get a deal. If you’re new to the house-buying game, we recommend checking out Miranda Crace’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/how-to-negotiate-house-price\">negotiating house prices</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also note that many of these costs can be rolled into your closing costs. This handy <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/mortgage/closing-costs\">closing costs calculator</a> by SmartAsset can give you an idea of what your closing costs might be.</p>\n<p>Finally, ask yourself what your long-term plans are for the house. Is this your forever home or a starter home? The answer may dictate what type of mortgage you get, which can save or cost a lot of money in the long run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2whatsincludedinthesale\">2. What’s included in the sale?</h3>\n<p>You know you’re getting the building itself, but beyond that, it’s not always clear what’s included when you buy a house. This question helps clarify what the sellers are taking with them (Window treatments? Appliances? Light fixtures?) and what they’re leaving behind. Once you have the answer, you can get a better handle on what you’ll need to spend to make the home livable, and that may affect what you’re willing to pay for the property.</p>\n<p>Liz Steelman, real estate editor at <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com\">Apartment Therapy</a>, notes that you don’t typically ask the seller directly. “Most people ask their [the buyer’s] real estate agent, who then asks the seller’s agent.”</p>\n<p>It’s usually best to get the sellers’ answer to this question in writing, especially if they promise to leave behind high-value items like a built-in sound system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3howlonghasthehousebeenonthemarket\">3. How long has the house been on the market?</h3>\n<p>Steelman recommends asking your agent right away how long the house has been for sale. “If it’s been on the market a long time, that often signals there are some issues with the property,” she says.</p>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, it’s not wise to make a low offer if the house has been on the market for 21 days or less. After 90 days, though, it may be safer to make a low offer (which, in this context, may mean something like 90 percent of the asking price).</p>\n<p>Your real estate agent can guide you through best practices for houses that have been on the market for more than 21 days and less than 90, where the nuances of what to offer may be trickier to navigate for the uninitiated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4whyisthesellermoving\">4. Why is the seller moving?</h3>\n<p>This is a super-important question to ask before buying a house because it can reveal a lot about the property or the neighborhood. Some reasons are obvious: the seller needs more space for a growing family, has to relocate for a new job, or is downsizing for retirement.</p>\n<p>Other reasons are less straightforward, according to David Reischer of <a href=\"https://real-estate-law.legaladvice.com\">LegalAdvice.com</a>. He says a seller is “a conflicted party” who usually only reveals defects that they’re legally obligated to disclose. Reischer goes on to say that “it is very unlikely to get a truthful answer by asking vague or general questions related to whether there are any problems with a house.”</p>\n<p>Even though Reischer believes that the home inspection is the best way to get this information, it is possible to ask, “Do you think there are any problems that will arise in the inspection?”</p>\n<h3 id=\"5howmuchhavenearbyhomessoldfor\">5. How much have nearby homes sold for?</h3>\n<p>This question gives you a sense of how your house compares to the ones around it. If you want the value of your home to increase, it’s probably better to buy the crummiest place in a nice neighborhood than the nicest place in a questionable neighborhood. So if yours is the most expensive home on the block, you may want to ask some questions about why.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of what properties around yours are selling for, search Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com for recently sold homes. You can also ask your real estate agent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6howmuchdoutilitiesusuallycost\">6. How much do utilities usually cost?</h3>\n<p>Before buying a home, don’t forget to ask about heating, cooling, electric, and internet costs! (And water, sewer, trash, recycling, etc.) You need to know what utilities cost in a typical month before you can decide if a house truly fits in your monthly budget.</p>\n<p>If utility costs seem high, you may want to look into greener alternatives in your area or investing in <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov\">Energy Star appliances</a> when existing equipment gives out. Both can reduce your total energy use and save you money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionstoaskaboutthepeopleyoullworkwith\">Questions to ask about the people you’ll work with</h2>\n<p>Real estate agents and mortgage brokers are two of your most important allies during the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">house buying process</a>. Ask these two questions to ensure you’ve made choices that are compatible with your preferences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7areyoufamiliarwiththearea\">7. Are you familiar with the area?</h3>\n<p>The importance of working with a real estate agent who genuinely understands the market where you want to buy cannot be emphasized enough. Without on-the-ground understanding, they may not be equipped to advise you on how to respond to various situations.</p>\n<p>A real estate agent who knows the area can do a better job of matching with homes that meet your needs, whether that means it’s near good schools or in your favorite neighborhood. They are also better judges of what the market in your area is doing, which means they can come up with a strategy that can put you in the home of your dreams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8ismymortgagebrokerresponsive\">8. Is my mortgage broker responsive?</h3>\n<p>The average mortgage takes <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ICE_OIR_AUG2021.pdf\">46 days to close</a>. During that time, your mortgage broker will be your primary point of contact with your lender and the person in charge of answering questions and making sure all your materials have been completed and submitted correctly. If this person isn’t responsive, your home buying process will be much more frustrating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionstoaskaboutthehousesrisks\">Questions to ask about the house’s risks</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve narrowed down your search to a few favorites, it’s time to ask questions about the houses’ exposures to risk. That way, you can evaluate each homes’ potential for costly problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9isthehomeonafloodplainshouldibeworriedaboutnaturaldisasters\">9. Is the home on a floodplain? Should I be worried about natural disasters?</h3>\n<p>Every state has different <a href=\"/blog/flood-disclosure-laws/\">flood disclosure laws</a> that outline what sellers must tell buyers about the flooding history of their homes. Regardless of your state’s laws, it’s wise to look up your property on <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search\">FEMA’s searchable floodplain map</a>, which offers a by-address breakdown of properties’ exposure to <a href=\"/glossary/100-year-floodplain/\">hundred-year flood conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>(Note: Typical homeowners insurance policies do not cover flood damage. For that protection, homeowners need a separate <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance policy</a>.)</p>\n<p>Floods may be the most common natural disaster, but they aren’t the only weather event to investigate. You also want to ask about the area’s propensity for hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, and blizzards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10doesthispropertyhaveahistoryofclaims\">10. Does this property have a history of claims?</h3>\n<p>Insurers are all about managing risk, so they may consider a property risky if they know it has a checkered past. Unfortunately, a house’s history of <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claims</a> may impact the price of your home insurance or even your ability to get a policy.</p>\n<p>While this may sound like a major bummer, think of it as fair warning: if a house experienced past water damage, there’s a higher risk it could face mold problems in the future.</p>\n<p>So how can you find out about that past? Great question. The easiest way is to ask the seller for a copy of their CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) report, which includes a seven-year record of insurable incidents that have happened to the house.</p>\n<p>A few important things to note about the <a href=\"/glossary/personal-reports/\">CLUE report</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the report is blank, the homeowner either made no claims in the last seven years OR made them to an insurer that doesn’t participate in CLUE.</li>\n<li>If the property has had multiple owners in the last seven years, you’ll need to get a CLUE report from each owner to see the house’s full history.</li>\n<li>CLUE reports outline claims made and amounts paid, but it doesn’t necessarily explain which part of the house was affected. For that, you’ll need to talk to the sellers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"11arethereanyhealthorsafetyhazardsthataninspectionmaymiss\">11. Are there any health or safety hazards that an inspection may miss?</h3>\n<p>This is a hugely important question to ask when buying a house. The presence of certain substances can pose a threat to the health of you and your family and may even mean your dream house is not worth the risk.</p>\n<p>Common hazards to look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead paint (<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-exposures-lead\">common in homes built before 1978</a>).</li>\n<li>Asbestos.</li>\n<li>Radon.</li>\n<li>Mold.</li>\n<li>Infestations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some of these may be included in your home inspection, they’re not all standard, so it’s important to ask. Most of these hazards require professional help to eliminate, which can be costly and time consuming.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12havethereeverbeenanyproblemswiththehouse\">12. Have there ever been any problems with the house?</h3>\n<p>This is an important catchall question to make sure you’re prepared for anything that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You haven’t asked about explicitly</li>\n<li>The sellers may not be legally obligated to disclose</li>\n<li>An inspector might not look for.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If damage has ever happened, ask who did the repairs and get their contact information if at all possible. Maintenance is a part of homeownership; the better prepared you are, the less stress it will cause you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionstoaskaboutthehousescondition\">Questions to ask about the house’s condition</h2>\n<p>No house is perfect. When you’re thinking of buying one, these questions can give you a sense of the particular imperfections the property has.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13hasthehousebeenremodeledorrenovated\">13. Has the house been remodeled or renovated?</h3>\n<p>Updates to a house may add comfort and value, but they’re also an opportunity for things to go wrong – especially if the owner was trying to save money on the addition or renovation (and let’s face it, aren’t we all trying to save some money?).</p>\n<p>If the property you’re considering has had additions or major renovations, ask the seller for details about who did the work and get their contact information. Even if you need to know something as simple as what color they painted the walls, you’ll be glad to have it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14howoldistheroof\">14. How old is the roof?</h3>\n<p>Roofs need regular repair, though <a href=\"/blog/how-long-do-roofs-last/\">how long a roof lasts</a> depends largely on the materials and the wear and tear it’s seen. Ask this question before buying a house to get a sense of how soon you’ll need to invest in a <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">new roof</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15howoldarethemajorappliancesandsystems\">15. How old are the major appliances and systems?</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever moved into a new home only to have the water heater give out that very week, you know the importance of checking the age of appliances. You should also ask about the age of the condenser, furnace, and plumbing – and whether they’ve been regularly serviced.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, ask the seller whether they have appliance warranties stashed anywhere. These documents can help you determine what kind of manufacturer protection your major appliances might still have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"16howbigisthewaterheater\">16. How big is the water heater?</h3>\n<p>Speaking of water heaters, it’s best to make sure yours is big enough to keep your family from having daily shrieking fits as the hot water gives out mid-shower.</p>\n<p>This chart below provides an estimate of how big your water heater should be based on your family size:</p>\n<h4 id=\"waterheatercapacitybyfamilysize\">Water Heater Capacity by Family Size</h4>\n<p>| People in Household | Hot Water Heater Needs |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 – 2 | 30 gallons+ |\n| 2 – 3 | 40 gallons+ |\n| 3 – 4 | 50 gallons+ |\n| 5+ | 80 gallons (electric) or 50 gallons (natural gas or liquid propane) |</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.totalhomesupply.com/water-heater-sizes\">Source</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"17caniseetheoriginalplansforthehouse\">17. Can I see the original plans for the house?</h2>\n<p>Not everyone will show you their original house plans, says Steelman, but if you can get them, they can be valuable. “Also ask if they have the original architect’s name and information,” she recommends – or the information of their firm if they’re no longer among the living.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionstoaskabouttheneighborhood\">Questions to ask about the neighborhood</h2>\n<p>Good neighbors can make a new house feel like a home. But how can you know what your new neighbors are like before you buy a house? The answer’s simple: ask!</p>\n<h3 id=\"19whatistheneighborhoodlike\">19. What is the neighborhood like?</h3>\n<p>An online search can give you crime statistics, but to get a real sense of the neighborhood’s energy and feel, you’ll need to ask someone who’s lived there. As with the question about why the sellers are leaving, the type of response you get may tell you a lot. Most sellers who don’t have anything nice to say may not say anything at all.</p>\n<p>If you’re buying a home with an HOA assessment, one way to get a sense of the community is to check the HOA’s financial health. It can serve as a proxy for at least the financial stability of the community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18doyoulikeyourneighbors\">18. Do you like your neighbors?</h3>\n<p>As with the question about why the sellers are leaving, the answer to this question can tell you a lot about the neighborhood. A gushy answer with lots of details suggests close, warm relationships. Reserved responses or those that equivocate may be a bad sign.</p>\n<p>But remember: the seller could be the neighborhood grump, so it’s important to take everything with a grain of salt. Get a feel for the place yourself by checking Facebook and NextDoor for neighborhood-specific groups. Follow along for a few days to see what residents are like.</p>\n<h3 id=\"20doyouknowofanyproblemneighborsorlocalnuisances\">20. Do you know of any problem neighbors or local nuisances?</h3>\n<p>Keep in mind that unpleasant or unsafe behavior can be more than a minor irritation – it can put you and your neighbors at risk. But smaller nuisances are also handy to know about, Steelman points out. “It might get really loud one weekend in September during a festival.” Forewarned, as they say, is forearmed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21doesthishousehaveanystigmaassociatedwithit\">21. Does this house have any stigma associated with it?</h3>\n<p>“Stigma” can mean anything from reports of haunting and paranormal activity to unsavory or illegal activity on the property.</p>\n<p>First, understand that houses with “stigma” typically sell well below their fair market value. Second, state and local laws vary widely in stigma disclosure requirements. That’s why it’s a good idea to ask about these things specifically, whether you believe in ghosts or not.</p>\n<p>If, for example, a house has a reputation for being <a href=\"/blog/haunted-homes/\">haunted</a>, there’s a good chance it attracts the kind of attention most homeowners prefer to avoid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22whatdoyouloveaboutlivinghere\">22. What do you love about living here?</h3>\n<p>Most of the questions you’re encouraged to ask before buying a home involve looking out for things that could go wrong. But it’s also smart to ask sellers what they loved best about the home, if for no other reason than it can help you discover everything the property has to offer sooner than you otherwise would have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionsareahomebuyersfriend\">Questions are a homebuyer’s friend</h2>\n<p>If you’ve never bought a house before, it can feel intimidating to pepper the seller or your real estate agent with questions. But for what’s likely the largest financial commitment of your life, you really can’t be too careful. Asking the right questions before making an offer on a home can prevent a lot of discomfort and save you a lot of money down the road.</p>"

    body: "<p>Picture this: you wake up one sunny morning with an inexplicable craving for an omelet. You head outside, greeted by the joyous clucks of your backyard chickens who you know by name: Henifer Aniston, Eggatha Christie, Yolko Ono, and Hilary Fluff. You open the nesting box hatch and find four beautiful eggs waiting for you like a gift.</p>\n<p>It’s the farm-to-table dream, only you don’t need a lot of land to make it a reality.</p>\n<p>While keeping backyard chickens is a type of urban agriculture that’s been around for years, it’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/03/826925180/we-are-swamped-coronavirus-propels-interest-in-raising-backyard-chickens-for-egg\">gained popularity since the onset of the pandemic</a>. More homeowners are finding that hens make wonderful companions, are easy to care for, and (of course) offer a steady supply of fresh eggs.</p>\n<p>But before you take the plunge into urban chicken keeping, do your research to make sure it’s the right fit for you and your family. Let’s explore the pros and cons of backyard chickens, chicken ordinances and permits, coop setup, chicken breeds to consider, and basic care for a healthy, happy flock.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isthebackyardchickenlifeforyou\">Is the Backyard Chicken Life for You?</h2>\n<p>Like any animal you bring into your home, backyard chickens require time and money to care for them properly. For chickens, consider how much space you have and whether raising them runs <em>afowl</em> of local ordinances (we couldn’t resist the pun). This list can help you weigh the benefits and potential disadvantages of keeping backyard chickens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prosandconsofbackyardchickens\">Pros and Cons of Backyard Chickens</h3>\n<p>| Benefits | Drawbacks |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fresh eggs | Limited egg-producing years |\n| Minimal space requirements | Upfront costs |\n| Education for the family | Noise |\n| Pest control | Chicken coop odors |</p>\n<h4 id=\"fresheggs\">Fresh Eggs</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fresh-eggs.jpg\" alt=\"hand with three eggs and three hens in the background\" />Clearly, one of the top reasons people decide to raise backyard chickens is for the eggs. Farm-fresh (or backyard-fresh) eggs have less cholesterol and saturated fat while providing more vitamin A, E, and D, as well as more omega-3 fatty acids. Plus, they’re delicious.</p>\n<p>If learning how to raise chickens for eggs is your top concern, you’ll be happy to know that you can expect about five to six eggs per week per chicken (depending on the breed). However, most hens reach their peak production when they’re 30-weeks old. By year seven, you’ll see less than half of your chicken’s original egg production. But remember, your hen is not an egg vending machine, and their companionship is rewarding, too!</p>\n<h4 id=\"spacerequirements\">Space Requirements</h4>\n<p>One reason urban chickens are so popular is because chickens generally don’t need a lot of space. Experts typically say you need about four square feet of space in the coop and 10 square feet in the run per chicken, which many backyards can accommodate. Be sure to check your city’s regulations, though. Some towns may require your coop to be a certain distance away from any living space.</p>\n<h4 id=\"costs\">Costs</h4>\n<p>Backyard chickens cost about $69 per month to raise five chickens over five years, and most of those expenses are upfront costs, like chicken coops, waterers, and feeders. Chicken coops alone can cost anywhere from $100 to $5,000. Ongoing costs aren’t usually as steep, but you definitely want to consider how much it might take to bring your chicken to the vet. It’s also worth noting that not all vets are trained in treating chickens.</p>\n<h4 id=\"educationforyourfamily\">Education for Your Family</h4>\n<p>Taking care of an animal can be a great learning experience, and people who learn how to raise backyard chickens report spending more quality time with their children. Depending on their age, your children can help with feeding your backyard chickens, collecting eggs, or cleaning the chicken coop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"noisepestcontrolandodors\">Noise, Pest Control, and Odors</h4>\n<p>First, let’s clear up a misconception: You don’t need a rooster if you want chickens for eggs. Hens naturally lay unfertilized eggs with or without a rooster present. In fact, many towns don’t allow roosters in city limits.</p>\n<p>That said, hens can be noisy birds, especially before they lay their eggs. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPNa5mkjR7A\">Ever heard an egg song</a>? Delightful! But your neighbors may disagree, so that’s something to consider.</p>\n<p>Both you and your neighbors will likely appreciate that hens are excellent for pest control. Many breeds eat ticks and mosquitoes, as well as slugs, hookworms, grasshoppers, and centipedes.</p>\n<p>And if you’re thinking of <a href=\"/blog/how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden/\">starting a vegetable garden</a>, you’ll have a nearly endless supply of chicken manure to use as fertilizer. Be sure to clean the coop at least once per week to keep the odor down and keep your chickens clean and healthy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cityordinancesandbackyardhens\">City Ordinances and Backyard Hens</h2>\n<p>Your local government may have rules about backyard chickens that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict the number or type of chickens you can have.</li>\n<li>Require you to get a permit.</li>\n<li>Limit your chickens’ proximity to your home.</li>\n<li>Mandate the size and materials of your chicken coop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, a <a href=\"https://library.municode.com/fl/fort_myers/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=SPAADCO_CH54NU_ARTIINGE\">Fort Myers, Florida city ordinance</a> prohibits chicken coops within 300 feet of a dwelling, and homeowners can only have one hen per 800 square feet of their total lot. <a href=\"https://www.orlando.gov/Building-Development/Planning-Approvals/Apply-for-a-Backyard-Chicken-Permit\">Orlando allows backyard chickens</a>, but you need a permit and the city only issues 100 of them on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>\n<p>Each city and county is different, so research the ordinances in your area. And while you may hear more about <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restrictions on dogs</a>, homeowners associations may also ban chickens.</p>\n<p>And as long as we're looking at regulations, you may want to give your insurance representative a call. They can make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> protects your new coop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chickencoopsbasicshelterrequirements\">Chicken Coops: Basic Shelter Requirements</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/coop.jpg\" alt=\"a buff orpington hen with chicks in front of a blue chicken coop with attached run\" /></p>\n<p><em>An example of a coop with a small attached chicken run.</em></p>\n<p>Chickens require a safe, secure, and insulated coop and a secured outdoor area – called a run – where they can peck in peace. A coop should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide at least four square feet of space per bird.</li>\n<li>Offer shelter from the sun, wind, or cold.</li>\n<li>Have good ventilation to maintain optimal temperatures for your hens – not too hot and not too cold.</li>\n<li>Provide at least one nesting box for every three hens.</li>\n<li>Have roosts (perches) where the birds can sleep at night.</li>\n<li>Have a door that opens into the run.</li>\n<li>Be predator-proof – foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and dogs prey on unsecured flocks, so keep your girls safe!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A note about the importance of chicken runs: though you may want your flock to freely roam your entire yard, make sure there’s a dedicated outdoor space that’s fully secured with chicken-wire. That’s because ground predators aren’t the only ones who have a taste for chicken – birds of prey have been known to snatch up free roaming hens, too. When you aren’t able to supervise your chickens, it’s nice to know they have access to a sunlit space where predators can’t hurt them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findingyourfirstbackyardchickens\">Finding Your First Backyard Chickens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/backyard-chickens-3.jpg\" alt=\"two Red Star hens, a hybrid breed known for their beautiful color and high egg production.\" /></p>\n<p><em>Red Star hens, pictured above, are a hybrid breed known for their beautiful color and high egg production.</em></p>\n<p>Now that you know you want to raise backyard chickens and it’s legal in your area, it’s time to choose the right breed. Keep in mind that chickens are very social animals – most don’t thrive without a friend. <strong>Plan to have at least two birds</strong> so they can keep each other company and snuggle for warmth if you live in a colder climate.</p>\n<p>As you explore chicken breeds, think about why you’re getting chickens and the environment you’ll bring them into. These questions can help you decide which breed to get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do my chickens need to tolerate the heat?</strong> If so, look for Mediterranean breeds, such as leghorns and Penedesencas. Their small, sleek bodies and large combs help them remain cool in hot, humid temperatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Do my chickens need to tolerate the cold?</strong> Homeowners in colder areas might consider large-bodied breeds, like australorps, Buff or Blue Orpingtons, and Wyandottes. Their thicker bodies are better able to keep them warm in colder conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Is egg production important?</strong> Australorps, leghorns, and Rhode Island reds are good choices when you want lots of eggs. Each chicken can provide up to six eggs per week throughout the spring and summer months. But if you only want eggs for your family, a medium producer like bantam chickens (which is actually a size, not a breed) may be a good fit because of their smaller eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Will children be near my chickens?</strong> If so, look for birds with mild temperaments, like australorps and brahmas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtocareforbackyardchickens\">How to Care for Backyard Chickens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/chicken-roost.jpg\" alt=\"two blue orpington hens perched on a roost\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re raising your chickens from the time they’re chicks, you’ll need to have the following supplies on hand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A brooder.</strong> This can be as simple as a box or a storage bin filled with pine shavings. Just make sure it’s tall enough so the chicks can’t jump out. Chicks are messy little things, so keep their brooder, waterer, and feeders clean. Litter should be cleaned daily, and sometimes more frequently if it gets wet.</li>\n<li><strong>Food and water dispensers.</strong> Fill their feeder with chick starter feed crumbles (found at any farm supply store) and make sure they have access to fresh water. When you first put the chicks in the brooder, dip their beaks in their food and water so they know where to find it.</li>\n<li><strong>Warmth.</strong> Chicks don’t have feathers until they are 6 to 7 weeks old and can’t regulate their own temperature until then. Use a heat lamp or a hen-safe heat plate to keep the brooder warm. During their first week, the temperature should be 95 degrees, and you can lower it by five degrees each week until ambient temperature is reached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chicks are usually ready for the coop at about 12 weeks. You can introduce them to the outdoors sooner, but be sure to supervise and limit their roaming area with a pen or mini run.</p>\n<p>Once full grown, chickens don’t demand a lot of care, but a consistent routine can keep them healthy and happy. A typical day might go like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morning.</strong> Let your chickens out of the coop so that they can access the chicken run. Check each hen for signs of good health, such as bright eyes, red comb and wattles, and shiny feathers. Give them fresh food and water, fluff the coop bedding, and look for eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Afternoon.</strong> Sometimes chickens lay eggs later in the day, so check for them again in the afternoon.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening.</strong> As the sun goes down, your hens will head to the coop on their own, but check for stragglers. Close the door that leads to the run so they are safe from predators. If you live in a colder climate, you may want to give your chickens some scratch grains. This is a combination of seeds and grains, and it can help keep them warm overnight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At least once a week, clean the coop and chicken run. This is the time to rake the old bedding out of the coop and replace it and to give your feeders and waterers a good scrub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonchickenproblemstoplanfor\">Common Chicken Problems to Plan For</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/hen.jpg\" alt=\"a hybrid maron hen with an orange neck and black saddle feathers\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re a first-time hen keeper, be prepared for a little learning curve. Chickens have some unique quirks that can be alarming to the uninitiated. Let’s look at a few problems to plan for so they don’t take you by surprise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"predators\">Predators</h3>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, though mighty, the chicken is dinner to almost everyone. Even your family dog could accidentally harm or kill them if you’re not careful. Don’t assume that because you’re in the city that a wily woodland creature or a hawk won’t hunt them if given the chance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peckingorder\">Pecking Order</h3>\n<p>Named for this chicken behavior, a pecking order establishes the flock hierarchy through actual pecking. If a hen jumps her place in line for food, the hen in charge will let her know with a definitive peck. If bullying gets out of hand and your hens have plenty of space, it might be a sign that your hens are bored. Adding toys (yes, hens like toys!) or a “flock block,” a heavy supplement block made with grains that encourages pecking, can help keep them entertained.</p>\n<h3 id=\"molting\">Molting</h3>\n<p>Molting is when your chicken sheds old feathers and grows new plumage. Their first molt usually happens when they’re 16 to 18 months old. The process often takes three months to complete and usually happens once a year. Be aware that it can be really stressful for your birds and may impact egg production.</p>\n<h3 id=\"broodiness\">Broodiness</h3>\n<p>You’ll know a broody hen when you see one. She often won’t leave her nesting box, puffs up her feathers, and gets feisty if anyone dares to disturb her. Hens get broody when they want their eggs to hatch, so if that’s not in the cards for your girls, you’ll want to intervene. Try removing her from the nesting box, but be careful – broody hens may bite and their beaks are no joke.</p>\n<p>Excited for your chickens to come home to roost? Or do you already have a flock?

    body: "<p>If you’ve paid attention to the news in the last year or so, you’ve probably heard a fair amount about mortgage refinancing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shouldyourefinanceyourmortgage\">Should you refinance your mortgage?</h2>\n<p>In July, CNBC proclaimed that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/01/8-million-homeowners-leave-cash-on-the-table-by-not-refinancing.html\">eight million homeowners</a> were leaving cash on the table by not refinancing. In December, the publication noted that weekly refinance rates were <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/27/mortgage-refinances-surge-over-300percent-from-a-year-ago.html\">up 314%</a> from a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Even if you previously had no plans to refinance your mortgage, you may have started wondering whether doing so would save you money. If you’re still wondering, you’re in the right place. You'll learn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What mortgage refinance loans are and how they work.</li>\n<li>When it may make sense to refinance a mortgage.</li>\n<li>How to actually go about refinancing your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read on for details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarerefinancedloanshowdotheywork\">What are refinanced loans &amp; how do they work?</h2>\n<p>A refinance loan is a type of mortgage loan. It replaces the original mortgage you took on to pay for your house. You take out the refinance loan to pay off the original loan, then make mortgage payments to the lender who originated your refinance mortgage.</p>\n<p>As the name of the loan implies, homeowners often take on refinance loans when they want to rework the financial terms of their mortgage – often so they can <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save money</a> in some capacity.</p>\n<p>It’s common for homeowners to refinance in order to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lower their interest rate, meaning they’ll pay less in interest over the life of the loan.</li>\n<li>Reduce their monthly payments, even if it means paying more interest over the life of the loan.</li>\n<li>Use some of the equity they’ve built up in their home. This is called a “cash-out refinance.”</li>\n<li>Eliminate their <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>Pay off the loan faster, often meaning they’ll have higher monthly payments but will pay less in interest over the life of the loan</li>\n<li>Achieve greater cost stability by switching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And because refinance loans are themselves a type of mortgage loan, homeowners have to go through roughly the same process to get them as they do with an original mortgage. Notably, this means you have to qualify for the loan itself and that you have to pay certain associated costs (including a <a href=\"/blog/when-to-get-your-home-reappraised/\">home appraisal</a> and closing fees).</p>\n<p>Because of those two factors, a mortgage refinance isn’t right for everyone. To get an idea of whether refinancing your mortgage can improve your financial situation, let’s take a look at when refinancing typically makes financial sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you refinance your mortgage, you have to pay for a home appraisal and closing fees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whenitmakessensetorefinanceyourmortgage\">When it makes sense to refinance your mortgage</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/refinance%20mortgage%202.jpg?width=1938&name=refinance%20mortgage%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The goal of refinancing a mortgage loan is typically to save money in some way, either on your monthly payments or on the overall cost of your loan (as outlined above).</p>\n<p>For individual homeowners, there are a few common triggers that indicate that it’s a good time to research whether taking on a refinancing loan makes financial sense, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest rates fall below what you’re currently paying</strong>. That’s what happened in 2019, when you likely saw dozens of headlines about how much homeowners were saving thanks to the refinance boom.</li>\n<li><strong>Your credit improves</strong>. When it does, you may qualify for a loan with more favorable terms than the one you currently have. If this happens, it may make sense to refinance even if interest rates haven’t changed much.</li>\n<li><strong>You’ve built enough equity to ditch your mortgage insurance</strong>. Once you have 20% equity in your home, you may qualify to eliminate your mortgage insurance. Doing so in a refinance could reduce your monthly payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But these triggering incidents are only part of the equation. Because refinancing a mortgage isn’t free (experts note that it usually costs between <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/refinance/when-and-when-not-to-refinance-mortgage/\">3 and 6%</a> of your loan’s principal), it’s important to run the numbers before leaping headlong into a refinance loan.</p>\n<p>There are a few numbers you might want to consider as you evaluate the potential benefits a refinance could bring you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Break-even point</strong>: This calculation weighs the money you pay to get your refinanced mortgage against the money you’ll save thanks to your new interest rate. How long will it take you, based on what you save on monthly payments, to recover what you spent on the new loan? Generally, the faster you hit your break-even point, the better. If the break-even point is too far in the future, it’s possible that the money you’d spend on getting the new mortgage would serve you better elsewhere – say, earning interest in an investment account.</li>\n<li><strong>Total savings</strong>: This number looks at the total amount you’ll save over the life of your refinanced loan. If you have the potential to significantly reduce your interest rate, this may be a useful metric to use.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly savings</strong>: Maybe your financial circumstances have changed and your main goal is to reduce your monthly expenses, even if that means paying more in interest over the life of your loan. In that case, you may want to consider how much money you’d save each month with your new loan terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice we haven’t offered any definitive guidelines here on when a homeowner should refinance a mortgage. That’s because everyone’s situation is different and may be affected by a number of variables, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your credit score.</li>\n<li>Your original interest rate and the rate currently available to you.</li>\n<li>Equity you have in the home.</li>\n<li>Your larger financial strategy and goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of this, it’s also possible that refinancing your mortgage could end up costing you more than the original loan. We really can’t emphasize enough how important it is to run the numbers for your particular case.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is to use a refinancing calculator. <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/refinance-calculator\">Nerdwallet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/refinance-calculator.aspx\">Bankrate</a> both offer free, easy-to-use options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtorefinanceyourmortgage\">How to refinance your mortgage</h2>\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers and determined that refinancing your mortgage makes financial sense, it’s time to start the actual process. First, decide which of the following is your goal for refinancing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay less in interest over the life of the loan</strong>: For this, you’ll probably want to lower your interest rates without lengthening your current payoff schedule.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower monthly payments</strong>: For this, you may want lower interest rates and a longer payoff schedule (e.g., by refinancing into a new 30-year mortgage).</li>\n<li><strong>Tap into equity</strong>: For this, you’ll want a “cash-out” refinance.</li>\n<li><strong>Eliminate mortgage insurance</strong>: For this, you’ll have to have at least 20% equity in your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce the length of the loan</strong>: For this, you’ll want to refinance into a loan with a shorter time horizon than your current payoff schedule.</li>\n<li><strong>Get into a more stable loan</strong>: For this, you’ll want to refinance into a fixed-rate loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you’ve defined your goal, do some online research to figure out what interest rates currently are. Then do some ballpark calculations: plug your numbers into an online refinance calculator to see what kind of savings you can expect.</p>\n<p>If the initial numbers look good, it’s time to get in touch with lenders. It’s best to compare offers from three to five lenders to ensure you’re getting the best deal. As you do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply within a two-week period to minimize the impact on your credit score.</li>\n<li>Ask for their rates for the loan type you want (e.g., fixed-rate, 15-year, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They’ll get back to you with loan estimates (including closing costs). Use these numbers to run your refinance calculations again.</p>\n<p>If everything still looks good, it’s time to go with the lender who offered you the most attractive deal and ask to “lock” your interest rate. Locking guarantees the rate for a set number of days, during which time you and your lender can try to close the loan.</p>\n<p>This part of the process should remind you of <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">getting your original mortgage</a>, because it’s roughly the same – except you won’t be moving into a new house when you’re finished. At this point, that’s probably a big relief!</p>\n<h2 id=\"closingthoughtsonrefinancingyourmortgage\">Closing thoughts on refinancing your mortgage</h2>\n<p>If you’ve never refinanced a mortgage, the process can be intimidating. It’s a major financial decision and you may feel like you’re on your own to make it.</p>\n<p>In reality, though, your lender should be motivated to help you. Lenders make money on mortgage refinances, so it’s in their best interest to help borrowers determine whether refinancing makes sense.</p>\n<p>And don’t be surprised if your lender doesn’t reach out to you proactively about refinancing opportunities available to you. Even though most banks and lenders have a lot of data on their customers, few have effective systems for effectively tracking when those customers might benefit from various financial products.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: refinancing a mortgage can lead to significant savings for some homeowners. If you’re curious about whether you should refinance, play around with some online calculators to get an initial idea of how the numbers add up for you.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, though: refinancing a mortgage does not make sense in every situation. It’s important to do your homework to make sure you end up in a loan that works with your long-term <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">financial goals</a>.</p>"

Though they are most commonly found in older homes that haven't been updated, check to make sure your home doesn't have one of these four recalled electrical panels to be safe.</p>\n<p>If your home does have one of these panels, work with a licensed electrician to replace it as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4recalledelectricalpanels\">4 recalled electrical panels</h2>\n<p>Electrical panels, sometimes called load centers or breaker panels, are service boxes that contain your main power line and distribute electricity to circuits throughout your home. If the panel fails to operate as expected, it can send too much electrical current through a circuit and cause a fire.</p>\n<p>Old electrical panels are usually found during the <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a> before you buy, but inspectors can miss them. The following panels are considered out of date or have been involved in an electrical panel recall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Stab-Lok panels</li>\n<li>Zinsco panels, also known as GTE Sylvania-Zinsco panels</li>\n<li>Challenger panels made by Challenger Electrical Equipment Corp or Eaton/Cutler Hammer</li>\n<li>Pushmatic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"federalpacificelectric\">Federal Pacific Electric</h3>\n<p>FPE panels were a popular electrical panel and were widely used starting in the 1950s through 1990. However, Stab-lok panels can fail to trip when a circuit is overloaded, causing the system to overheat and potentially ignite a fire. This issue led the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to investigate Stab-Lok panels in the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>While FPE Stab-Lok panels were never actually recalled, most electricians recommend removing them. Here are a few ways you may be able to recognize FPE Stab-loks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Pacific Electric or FPE stamped into the metal cover.</li>\n<li>An information sticker on the inside that reads Federal Pacific Electric, Federal Pioneer FPE, or Stab-lock.</li>\n<li>Breakers with a red stripe on each switch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"zinsco\">Zinsco</h3>\n<p>Many homes built or updated in the 1970s, particularly those in the western portion of the county, have electrical panels made by Zinsco. Unfortunately, these panels have several design flaws that create a serious electrical panel fire hazard, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insecure connections between breakers and bus bars (the part that distributes power).</li>\n<li>Components made of aluminium that need to be replaced at 30 years.</li>\n<li>Bus bars that corrode easily.</li>\n<li>Breakers that melt into the bus bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, Zinsco panels may continue to conduct electricity even when the breaker appears to be off.</p>\n<p>Zinsco was purchased by GTE Sylvania in 1973, so you want to check your electrical panels for the following names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zinsco</li>\n<li>Sylvania</li>\n<li>GTE-Sylvania</li>\n<li>Sylvania-Zinsco</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also look for bright red, blue, and green tabs on the individual breakers, but treat this as a rule of thumb. Zinsco electrical panels can also have black breakers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"challenger\">Challenger</h3>\n<p>During the 1980s and early 1990s, Challenger electrical panels were installed into hundreds of thousands of homes, but they were <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1988/challenger-electrical-equipment-corp-offers-replacement-program-for-9000-gfci-circuit\">recalled in 1988</a>. That recall specifically focused on Challenger panels with 15- and 20- ampere circuit breakers made between February and April of 1988 that have a mechanical component that can detach leading to overheating, melting, and fire.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, problems with these panels continued even after Eaton/Cutler Hammer purchased Challenger. In 2014, Eaton/Cutler Hammer recalled 1,000 panels because their easily accessed components presented a shock risk.</p>\n<p>You may have a Challenger electrical panel that you need to replace if you see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Challenger stamped on the handle or door.</li>\n<li>Challenger on the manufacturer’s label (often found on the inside of the panel door).</li>\n<li>Circuits with yellow buttons and the word “test” on one side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that Challenger parts can show up in other electrical panels, including those made by GTE Slyvania and Zinsco.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pushmatic\">Pushmatic</h3>\n<p>Pushmatic panels were popular from 1950 through 1980. During that time, the Pushmatic system wasn’t known to have any fire hazard, but it’s now considered an outdated system and should be replaced. Be forewarned that you can still buy new Pushmatic components. However, these parts may not be compatible with the original Pushmatic electrical panel.</p>\n<p>Identifying a Pushmatic panel is relatively easy. Unlike most panels that have right to left switches, a Pushmatic has rectangular buttons that activate and deactivate circuits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"electricalpanelsafetytips\">Electrical panel safety tips</h2>\n<p>Do not remove your panel! Your panel should only be maintained by a licensed electrician. But it is smart to look for signs that yours needs to be replaced, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rust.</li>\n<li>Corrosion.</li>\n<li>Evidence of melting.</li>\n<li>Pest damage.</li>\n<li>Poor panel access.</li>\n<li>Nearby water or condensation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these could indicate that you should leave your electrical panel alone and call a professional electrician. The same is true if you hear popping or crackling noises. Moreover, if you feel a tingle or charge when you touch your electrical panel, back away and call a professional.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettinghomeinsurancewitholdelectricalpanels\">Getting home insurance with old electrical panels</h2>\n<p>You may have a difficult time getting even <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">high-risk homeowners insurance</a> if you have an electrical panel that is a known fire hazard. But if you replace the panel with the help of a licensed electrician, your insurance company might decide to offer you a policy. You may need evidence that you have made the change, like a work order or receipt.</p>\n<p>If you know that you have a problematic circuit panel and fail to disclose this to your insurance provider, a fire claim could be denied.

    body: "<p>Home insurance typically covers your losses in one of two ways: by insuring your property for its replacement cost or its actual cash value. Both can help you recover after a loss, but you want to understand the difference so you know what you’re getting when you buy your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedifferencebetweenreplacementcostvsactualcashvalue\">The Difference Between Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, replacement cost and actual cash value are different methods for determining the value of your property. A <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> valuation means your insurance company pays what it would cost to replace your home today using current prices, minus your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">Actual cash value</a>, however, uses the value of your home minus <a href=\"/glossary/depreciation/\">depreciation</a> to determine the maximum amount your insurer pays.</p>\n<p>Knowing the difference between replacement cost and actual cash value can help you decide if you’re getting a good deal. Actual cash value policies are often less expensive, but they don’t provide as much coverage in a loss. And imagine learning that tidbit when you have to file an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"calculatingreplacementcostvalue\">Calculating Replacement Cost Value</h2>\n<p>Replacement cost value is the cost of rebuilding or replacing your home with materials of a similar type and quality at today’s prices. At Kin, our agents evaluate the various features and characteristics of your home, such as the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type of walls.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/how-to-calculate-square-footage-of-a-house/\">Square footage</a>.</li>\n<li>Type of floors.</li>\n<li>Number of corners.</li>\n<li>Type of countertops.</li>\n<li>Building materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also look at the cost of construction at the time you’re applying for coverage. Once we crunch the numbers, we generate a <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimate</a> (RCE) of your home. The RCE reflects how much it would cost to replace your entire home with the similar materials today.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we regularly recalculate RCEs in case there are any changes in the marketplace. This helps ensure that our premiums are fair and accurate, and that your home is adequately protected.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there's a difference between <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">replacement cost vs. the market value</a> of the home which can be higher or lower than the cost to rebuild it</p>\n<h3 id=\"isreplacementcostinsuranceenough\">Is Replacement Cost Insurance Enough?</h3>\n<p>Even with the annual updating of the replacement cost estimate, there may be instances when the home is underinsured. This can happen when the cost of building materials or supplies spike, as <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber did in 2021</a>, or when new ordinances that cause the rebuilding to be more expensive.</p>\n<p>Kin members can protect against this situation by adding an endorsement to their policies called a Specified Additional Amount of Insurance for Coverage A. It creates a \"cushion\" in case you have a total loss where circumstances push the cost of a replacement over the amount provided in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"calculatingactualcashvalue\">Calculating Actual Cash Value</h2>\n<p>While a replacement cost valuation is based on what you would have to pay to rebuild your home in today’s market conditions, actual cash value (ACV) is the cost to rebuild your home minus depreciation. Depreciation is the amount of value your home loses over time due to age or wear and tear.</p>\n<p>If your policy insures your home and personal property for its actual cash value and you experience a loss, then it’s helpful to have receipts for your items as well as descriptions of the make and model. That way, you have a better chance at getting a reasonable payout when the <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> determines the actual cash value of the damaged items.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatifidontagreewiththeacv\">What If I Don’t Agree with the ACV?</h2>\n<p>You can dispute the adjuster’s assessment of the value of your damaged items, but you’ll need documented proof to strengthen your case to the insurer. A good way to do this is to take a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> before you even get insured. Not only can that help should you have a claim, but it gives a better idea of how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a> you need.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have any way of showing what your personal property is worth, then the adjuster or your insurance company will offer their best estimate of the value of the items you have lost. You’ll get a quote of this estimate before you’re issued payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replacementcostvsactualcashvaluewhichisbetterforme\">Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value: Which Is Better for Me?</h2>\n<p>Choosing the right valuation method depends on your objectives. If you want an easier time replacing lost or damaged items or rebuilding your home, replacement cost coverage is the clear winner. Though it costs a little more, this type of coverage offers you the means to replace your property with new items instead of looking for bargains or secondhand stuff.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, home insurance based on your property’s actual cash value can be less expensive. That may be the right choice if you’re on a tight budget. However, you should know that you may not get enough to replace all of your items or rebuild your home to its current condition if you experience a loss.</p>"

    body: "<p>About 64 percent of homeowners don’t have enough insurance, according to CoreLogic’s <a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/products/residential-cost-handbook.aspx\">Residential Cost Handbook</a>. Worse, their homes are underinsured by an average of 27 percent. But what does being underinsured really mean? After all, you should be protected if you have insurance, right?</p>\n<p>Unlike someone who is uninsured, an underinsured homeowner has a policy, but the coverage is insufficient. This leaves them with bigger expenses if they ever file a claim. Many times, underinsured homeowners think they have adequate coverage only to find out in a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster</a> that they don’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesunderinsuredmean\">What Does Underinsured Mean?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, being underinsured means you have a policy that only covers a portion of your losses in a claim, often because of exclusions or coverage limits. For example, you might insure your home for $300,000, only to find out that rebuilding it after a total loss costs $400,000. Homeowners who are underinsured may have to pay tens of thousands – maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars –&nbsp;out of their own pockets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifyouareunderinsured\">What Happens if You Are Underinsured?</h3>\n<p>According to Brian Evans, CEO and founder of claims management firm <a href=\"http://easternpublic.com/\">Eastern Public</a>, “Underinsuring property can be a life-changing mistake for homeowners. This is because <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is often the only resource available to them to recover their home or to respond to a variety of other loss-related expenses.”</p>\n<p>With such big costs at stake, each homeowner needs to fully understand the potential financial impact underinsurance is to their personal situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyhomeownersareunderinsured\">Why Homeowners Are Underinsured</h2>\n<p>With more than half of US homes underinsured, you have to wonder why so many homeowners don’t get enough coverage. What are the biggest reasons for underinsurance in today’s market?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there's no one cause. Underinsurance can be the result of any number of events, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undervaluing your property.</li>\n<li>Misunderstanding what’s covered and what’s not.</li>\n<li>Failing to account for construction costs.</li>\n<li>Failing to report upgrades to your insurer.</li>\n<li>Choosing to not increase sub-limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies can also make mistakes in underwriting or historical data collection that can cause a homeowner to be underinsured. Moreover, sometimes agent negligence is the root of the problem, such as an agent failing to ask the right questions or perform their due diligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7underinsuranceexamplesforhomeowners\">7 Underinsurance Examples for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>There are several ways in which your home can end up being underinsured. Perhaps the most common is when you assume it’s safe from catastrophes. Unfortunately, <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change is putting more homes at risk</a> for major disasters. But underinsurance can also be a problem if homeowners misjudge the value of their personal property or their chances of being sued after an accident. Below are just a few examples of how homeowners end up underinsured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1underestimatingyourriskforcatastrophe\">1. Underestimating Your Risk for Catastrophe</h3>\n<p>Homeowners often assume they aren’t likely to suffer a catastrophic loss, so they’re better off skimping on insurance to save money. It’s hard to blame them, considering how home insurance premiums have risen steadily throughout the country. The most recent report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows rates increased <a href=\"https://content.naic.org/article/news_release_naic_releases_homeowners_insurance_report.htm_0\">3.1 percent</a> from 2017 to 2018.</p>\n<p>These increased costs may have homeowners weighing the risk versus reward of paying more for insurance on the outside chance they have a catastrophic loss. But the reality is that we’re seeing more losses with bigger price tags, and that means homeowners who think they can cut back on coverage may be in for a world of trouble.</p>\n<h4 id=\"underinsuranceandnaturaldisasters\">Underinsurance and Natural Disasters</h4>\n<p>Let’s start with wildfires. Veridesk’s Wildfire Analysis Report identifies <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/insurance/campaigns/location-fireline-state-risk-report/\">4.5 million U.S. homes</a> as being in areas of high or extreme risk for wildfire, with over 2 million located in California. According to Insurance Business America, <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/wildfire-victims-are-largely-underinsured-116580.aspx\">80 percent of homes</a> affected by 2018 California wildfires were underinsured. If we assume this percentage is the same for all the homes with high or extreme risk, then 3.6 million homes are underinsured for a wildfire and may not be able to rebuild after a catastrophic loss.</p>\n<p>Of course, wildfires aren’t the only risk that homeowners may be underinsured for. Hail storms, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes can all cause severe damage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that the US saw 22 weather events where losses exceeded $1 billion in 2020. This beats the previous record of 16 (2011 and 2017) and is the sixth year in row where the US sustained 10 or more billion-dollar weather events.</p>\n<p>As the chart below shows, the average cost of billion-dollar disaster events (represented by the black line) has been climbing over the last 20 years. Also note that each of the colored lines, the ones that show the biggest jump in costs, represent recent years (i.e., 2005, 2011, 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2020).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/year-to-date-disasters.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/\">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2021)</a>. DOI: <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.25921/stkw-7w73\">10.25921/stkw-7w7</a></em></p>\n<p>Since 1980, the year NOAA started tracking billion-dollar disasters, the US has suffered 285 of them, 41 percent of which occurred between 2010 and 2019. But perhaps the most important number is how many states have had at least one natural disaster that costs more than $1 billion: 50. The map below shows just how many areas were impacted by billion-dollar weather and climate disasters just in 2020.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/billion-dollar-climate-disasters.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/\">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2021)</a>. DOI: <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.25921/stkw-7w73\">10.25921/stkw-7w7</a></em></p>\n<p>Storms don’t have to cause billions of dollars in damage to do great financial harm to homeowners, either. According to Evans, “Homeowners insurance policies will often exclude coverage entirely, include separate sub-limits of insurance, or impose higher deductibles for losses resulting from wildfire or hurricane. . . This presents difficult challenges for consumers to navigate when reviewing their policies to ensure they have adequate insurance coverage.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether you think the problem is man-made or natural, climate change is increasing your risk for a number of catastrophes. If you haven’t addressed this in your homeowners insurance, then there’s a good chance that you’re underinsured.</p>\n<h4 id=\"canunderinsuredhomeownersrelyonfederalaidafteradisaster\">Can Underinsured Homeowners Rely on Federal Aid After a Disaster?</h4>\n<p>Homeowners probably shouldn’t rely solely on funds from the <a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster programs</a>. Without a doubt, those funds are necessary after a disaster, but they aren’t alway readily available, and you may receive a prorated amount based on the total assessed loss in your area.</p>\n<p>Long story short? That means you’re competing with your neighbor for assistance grants that may or may not be available by the time FEMA gets to you. Look at Hurricane Katrina as an example. More than a decade later, New Orleans and outlying neighborhoods are still trying to rebuild and get the <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/fourteen-years-later-new-orleans-is-still-trying-to-recover-from-hurricane-katrina\">pre-hurricane population back</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2notcheckingconstructioncosts\">2. Not Checking Construction Costs</h3>\n<p>You should always look to insure your home for the amount it will take to rebuild it. However, rising construction costs can cause you to be underinsured if you simply renew your coverage for the same amount every year. Fluctuating costs for materials and labor could mean you don’t have enough coverage, especially if you’ve insured your home for its actual cash value. The depreciated value of your home will be even further away from the amount you’ll need to spend to replace it.</p>\n<p>Construction costs have been climbing fairly steadily for a few years and don’t show any signs of slowing down. The <a href=\"https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx\">most recent data</a> from the National Association of Home Builders shows the average cost for building a single-family home is $296,652, or $114 per square foot. Compare that to the average cost in previous years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2011: $80 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2013: $95 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2015: $103 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2017: $86 per square foot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to JLL’s latest H1 2021 Construction Outlook, costs will continue to rise, increasing between 3.5 and 5.5 percent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3undervaluingyourpersonalproperty\">3. Undervaluing Your Personal Property</h3>\n<p>While homeowners are usually most concerned about rebuilding their homes after a claim, they can also face significant costs if they fail to fully insure their personal property (i.e., all the stuff inside your home). Imagine a total loss on a home where the homeowner insured all of their personal property for $20,000. At a minimum, that $20,000 has to pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kitchen appliances.</li>\n<li>Furniture for every room.</li>\n<li>Electronics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That list doesn’t even take into consideration clothing, dishes, cookware, and other home goods that may need replacing.</p>\n<p>Many insurance companies set a default coverage amount for personal property, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a> on your declarations page, that is a percentage of the building replacement value found in <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>. This default coverage can be anywhere between 10 percent to 75 percent of the building replacement value, depending on your insurer.</p>\n<p>However, you’re not stuck with the default amount. You can request personal property coverage of up to 100 percent or more of your home’s replacement value. Doing so can help you get back to normal after a major loss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4underinsuringforliability\">4. Underinsuring for Liability</h3>\n<p>Liability claims are where a homeowner is responsible for someone else’s bodily injury or property damage. This type of claim typically covers events like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your dog biting the mail carrier.</li>\n<li>Your tree falling on the neighbor’s property.</li>\n<li>Swimming pool accidents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between 2014 and 2018, liability claims accounted for <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">1.9 to 4.0 percent</a> of all homeowners claims and averaged $26,872 according to a report created by Verisk Analytics and cited by the Insurance Information Institute (III). The III also reports that the average dog bite claim in 2019 <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-dog-bite-liability\">paid out $44,760</a> with some claims costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. While these averages are covered by the standard $100,000 in personal liability found in most homeowners insurance policies, any outlier claim over this leaves homeowners exposed to additional costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5insuringyourhomesactualcashvalue\">5. Insuring Your Home’s Actual Cash Value</h3>\n<p>When it comes to property coverage, you can insure your property’s <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> or its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. These are two very different ways to insure a home that can dramatically affect the cost and the coverage.</p>\n<p>Actual cash value insures your property based on its depreciated value. Let’s say you insure your home on an actual cash value basis, and you suffer a total loss. Your insurance company is going to look at the value of your home, subtract an amount for depreciation, and pay you that, up to your policy limits. So if your home’s depreciated value is $100,000, but rebuilding it costs $150,000, you’re going to come up short in a claim.</p>\n<p>Instead, homeowners should insure homes for the replacement cost, which is the amount it costs to repair or replace the property without subtracting for depreciation. Insuring for your home’s replacement cost is usually more expensive, but it keeps you from being underinsured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6ignoringsublimits\">6. Ignoring Sub-limits</h3>\n<p>Home insurance policies can have sub-limits, or a set coverage amount for a specific type of loss. For example, a homeowners policy might cap payouts for damaged computer equipment at $1,500, firearms at $2,000, and jewelry at $3,000. If any of these items are damaged in a covered claim, then your insurers only pays up to the sub-limit.</p>\n<p>As Evans points out, failing to take notice of sub-limits can cause homeowners to be underinsured because the total limit of insurance isn’t available in all scenarios. He uses the example of a frozen pipe causing water damage and mold in a $400,000 home. According to Evans, “The insurance policy for the home may provide insurance coverage up to $400,000, but a separate much smaller limit for mold-related expenses often exists.”</p>\n<p>So while the insurance policy covers the home for the full value, it’s actually underinsured for the claim in question. Understanding this before claims arise empowers you to ask more questions about your policy’s sub-limits so you can be more fully protected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7relyingonyourcondosmasterpolicy\">7. Relying on Your Condo’s Master Policy</h3>\n<p>Condominium owners sometimes make the mistake of assuming they have sufficient coverage because part of their fees goes to what’s known as a <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">master policy</a>. This is essentially insurance purchased by the condo association to cover its liability and property damage to the building’s main structure and common areas.</p>\n<p>So let’s say a pipe bursts in your multi-unit building, causing damage in your condo and the building’s entryway. The condo association’s master policy covers damage to the entryway, but pays nothing for your damage, leaving you underinsured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidunderinsurance\">How to Avoid Underinsurance</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners fulfill their mortgage company’s insurance requirement and are done with their policy until it’s time to renew. While your bank may be satisfied, you’re probably better off taking the time to dig a little deeper into your policy. You want to understand what’s covered, what exclusions or limitations exist, and how one policy works to fill gaps of another (i.e., pairing a homeowners policy with a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance policy</a>).</p>\n<p>You’ve already taken the first step by researching what happens when you’re underinsured. The next is to have an honest conversation with your insurance provider. This means asking what a standard policy covers and how you can fill any gaps. It may also mean making sure your provider knows that your home is on the Gulf Coast or that it’s over 100 years old. These details might cause your premium to go up, but getting the right coverage for your situation typically saves you money in the long run.</p>"

If you have a restricted breed, you may find that there are limits to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> if you are even able to get insurance at all.</p>\n<p>For many insurance companies, these breeds are considered restricted dog breeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Akita</li>\n<li>Alaskan malamute</li>\n<li>American Staffordshire terrier</li>\n<li>Bullmastiff</li>\n<li>Chow chow</li>\n<li>Doberman pinscher</li>\n<li>German shepherd</li>\n<li>Great Dane</li>\n<li>Pit bull</li>\n<li>Presa canario (canary dog)</li>\n<li>Rottweiler</li>\n<li>Siberian husky</li>\n<li>Staffordshire bull terrier</li>\n<li>Any wolf hybrids</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting home insurance when you have one of these pawsome puppers can be difficult, but it’s not impossible. In fact, some states no longer allow insurance companies to restrict breeds. Plus, you may be able to find <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a> even if your dog is a restricted breed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"otherprohibitedanimalsforhomeinsurance\">Other prohibited animals for home insurance</h3>\n<p>Certain breeds of dogs aren’t the only animals that can make it difficult for you to get home insurance. Other prohibited animals may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animals that have previously bitten someone.</li>\n<li>Animals that are trained to attack.</li>\n<li>Animals that have been deemed vicious, dangerous, or potentially dangerous under the law.</li>\n<li>Exotic animals, hooved animals, farm animals, saddle animals, or livestock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, having one of these prohibited animals increases the risk of injury or property damage, and that may make home insurance companies wary of offering you coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyhomeownersinsurancehasdogbreedrestrictions\">Why homeowners insurance has dog breed restrictions</h2>\n<p>Dog bites may be more common than you think. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), more than <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/public/Pages/Dog-Bite-Prevention.aspx\">4.5 million people</a> suffer dog bites every year, and 80,000 need medical attention.</p>\n<p>Not all of those dog bites rise to the level of an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>, but when they do they can be costly. Dog bites cost the insurance industry <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-dog-bite-liability\">$882 million dollars</a> in 2021. The average cost per claim? $49,025.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of money going out the door for insurance providers. They had to find a way to minimize the problem, and restricted breeds were their answer because these are the dogs perceived as the most likely to bite. Is it a perfect solution? Hardly. As the AVMA argues, any dog can bite and many factors beyond breed need to be considered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetinsurancewhenyouhavearestrictedbreed\">How to get insurance when you have a restricted breed</h2>\n<p>You want to be upfront with your insurer if your dog is on the restricted breed list. There may be consequences, but it’s better to know there’s an issue than to think you’re covered when you’re not. Plus, you may be able to work something out with the provider.</p>\n<p>Here are a few ways you may still be able to get homeowners insurance when your pup is considered a risky breed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask about exceptions.</strong> Some insurers make exceptions for service dogs or dogs who have earned a Canine Good Citizen certificate from the American Kennel Club.</li>\n<li><strong>Get dog liability insurance.</strong> A quick internet search shows a number of insurance companies sell coverage specifically for dogs on restricted breed lists.</li>\n<li><strong>Do a DNA breed test.</strong> Is your bullmastiff actually a pug? Probably not. But looks can be deceiving and a DNA test may show your dog shouldn’t be on the restricted breed list.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for another home insurance provider.</strong> Different insurers have different restrictions, so you may be able to find one that covers your dog liability. Do some research online to see what companies offer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without insurance, you may end up paying someone’s medical bills after a dog bite. Talk to your agent to come up with a solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preventingdogliabilityclaims\">Preventing dog liability claims</h2>\n<p>Once you have home insurance that covers dog liability, you still want to minimize the chance of making a claim to help <a href=\"/blog/find-low-cost-home-insurance/\">keep your premium low</a>. While you can’t completely eliminate the risk, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep an eye on your dog’s body language.</strong> Tense, distressed, and excited dogs are more likely to bite, so watch your dog for signs, like a rigid body, fur standing up, or wagging. When you see these or other signs, remove your dog from the situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Socialize your dog.</strong> Expose your dog to new people and animals. This may help them get used to novelty and reduce the chance they’ll bite.</li>\n<li><strong>Train your dog.</strong> Even if it can’t get Sparky off the restricted breed list, an obedience class is a good idea for most dogs and their owners.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your dog safe.</strong> Bites aren’t the only way your dog may hurt someone. Your dog can also cause accidents and property damage if they’re roaming free, so know where your dog is at all times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dog breed restrictions for home insurance are a reality for now. Work with your agent to find appropriate coverage so you can enjoy your home with your pupper.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in July 2018.

    body: "<p>A lot of factors go into buying a house for the first time, but perhaps the most pressing concern usually boils down to money. How can you afford a new home? How do you keep bills and home insurance premiums low?</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosavemoneyonyourfirsthome\">How to save money on your first home</h2>\n<p>We talked to a few people who’ve been on both sides of the homeownership equation: a realtor, a mortgage servicing specialist, and a landlord. These experts in their fields are also homeowners who’ve owned more than one property. We asked them to share their best <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">money-saving tips</a> for first-time homeowners, including how to make money off a new real estate investment, how to make the home energy efficient, and how to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">avoid homeowners insurance claims</a>. Here’s the advice from folks who’ve seen it all and who’ve been in the real estate business for more than 35 years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1considerbuyingamultifamilyhometohelppayforyourfirstmortgage\">1. Consider buying a multifamily home to help pay for your first mortgage</h3>\n<p>When you’re just starting out as a homeowner, look at all of your options. If you’re open to living in an apartment, you may want to consider purchasing an income-producing property like a multifamily property. If you plan well, you’ll likely be able to cover your monthly mortgage payments with rental income.</p>\n<p>The initial purchase may be slightly larger than a single-family residence, but if and when you’re ready to move up to a different home, you’ll receive a bump in income when you’re able to rent out your old unit. When you do make this move, you’ll have to make adjustments to your homeowners insurance (and <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord policy</a>), but your insurance company can talk you through those steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Advice for multifamily homeowners</strong>: To keep your budget balanced, save 40 percent of your rental revenue for regular expenses. This may include the cost of utilities, taxes, and insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2preservelivablespaceduringmajorimprovementstoavoidrent\">2. Preserve “livable space” during Major improvements to avoid rent</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for a deal to ease you into homeownership, your first house may need some renovations. Consider moving in before the work is complete to skip paying for a short-term rental while you’re updating your new house. If you go this route, you’re sure to save money, but it’s important that you’re able to live comfortably in your new space for the duration of your projects.</p>\n<p>We spoke to one homeowner who moved into their first home while they were in the middle of converting it from a single-family residence into a three-unit multifamily.</p>\n<p>They learned fast it was crucial to have a safe haven within the renovation chaos where they could do everything they needed to do on a daily basis. They made sure that they could live, eat, and sleep in a space that was separate from the construction area.</p>\n<p><strong>Sage words for moving mid-renovation</strong>: Set aside livable space, and the transition will feel a lot more manageable – and a lot less expensive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3checkcontractorreferencestoavoidgettingburned\">3. Check contractor references to avoid getting burned</h3>\n<p>Those renovations? Chances are you’re not going to do them all yourself. It can be hard to know <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">how to hire the right contractor</a> when you’re starting out in your first house, but the homeowners we talked to recommend talking with your friends and neighbors to find out who is doing the kind of work you need locally.</p>\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.angi.com/\">Angi</a> and other online resources offer reviews and money-saving tips for first-time homeowners who need to hire a helping hand. These outlets didn’t exist when many veteran homeowners started out in the 80’s, but even today many folks rely on recommendations from peers. Of course, as one realtor told us, it’s still a good idea to check references.</p>\n<p>The realtor hired an expert to upgrade the energy efficiency of their antique windows. Everyone they spoke with said this contractor did excellent work, so the homeowner didn’t check his references.</p>\n<p>The contractor turned out to be flighty and challenging to work with, and he dragged the project timeline to its breaking point. As the project went on, the homeowners discovered that the other contractors they’d hired knew the window guy was tough. The folks who recommended him knew, too, but no one offered up that information and the homeowners had failed to ask.</p>\n<p><strong>Words of wisdom</strong>: Don’t skip calling references and asking frank questions when it’s time to hire a contractor. Having the right person on the job will save you time (and time is money when you’re being billed hourly).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Renovations are an investment on their own, so save money by hiring a contractor who will adhere to the project timeline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"4keepenergybillslowwithgoodinsulation\">4. Keep energy bills low with good insulation</h3>\n<p>One of the major surprises for new homeowners is often <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">energy costs</a>. If you’re a first-time homeowner moving up from a condominium or a rented apartment, you’ll be heating or cooling a lot more square footage. And that may put strain on your monthly budget.</p>\n<p>The homeowners we spoke with all agreed that whether you live in an extreme climate on either end of the thermostat, it doesn’t matter what your heating or cooling source is if your home is well-insulated.</p>\n<p>If the first home you buy needs insulation improvements, make an investment early into your homeownership to improve your home’s energy efficiency (and save money!) for decades.</p>\n<p><strong>Save on energy costs</strong>: Make sure your house is well-insulated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5conservewatertosavedollars\">5. Conserve water to save dollars</h3>\n<p>One of the best tips for first-time homeowners who are looking to save money? Conserve water.</p>\n<p>Water conservation at home goes beyond turning off the tap while you’re brushing your teeth. Among the worst water wasters are a running toilet and a leaky faucet.</p>\n<p>Consider that on average water bills cost homeowners <a href=\"https://www.move.org/utility-bills-101/\">$150 per quarter</a> (around $600 annually). If you have a running toilet, that bill could triple to over $450. That’s no joke.</p>\n<p><strong>Airtight advice for homeowners</strong>: It’s important to have good faucets that don’t leak and toilets that don’t run to save on water costs. Keep your plumbing in ship shape.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6makerepairsbeforeproblemsgetmoreexpensive\">6. Make repairs before problems get more expensive</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a problem that will solve itself when it comes to home repairs. Roots displacing the front walk will only displace more, and a leaking roof won’t patch itself. Home repair needs only get more extreme with time.</p>\n<p>To follow the advice on water conservation: If you have an unreliable old toilet that requires a plumber’s attention every other month, in addition to the cost of wasted water, you’ll be tallying up the cost of repairs that <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/plumbing/repair-a-toilet/\">average of $220</a>. You can pay for three or four repairs over the course of a year, or purchase and install a new toilet for around $400.</p>\n<p>To neglect a running toilet is basically the equivalent of going into the kitchen, turning on your faucet, and leaving it running for days. It’s just not smart. A new, low flow toilet will contribute to your water conservation efforts and the savings that come with those.</p>\n<p><strong>Repair reminder</strong>: Consider what the cost of leaving whatever’s broken as is for a month. Extend that over a full year; how much will it cost you to wait?</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conserve utilities when you can – those bills can add up fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"7maintainyourheatingsourcetodelayacostlyreplacement\">7. Maintain your heating source to delay a costly replacement</h3>\n<p>Your heating or cooling appliances are critical pieces of your home’s machinery. And they don’t come cheap.</p>\n<p>Whether you have a swamp cooler or a propane furnace, keep these major home appliances on a regular maintenance schedule.</p>\n<p>For some appliances, this may be as simple as changing a filter, but many home appliances need to be serviced on a regular basis to stay within their <a href=\"/blog/what-is-home-warranty-insurance/\">warranty</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: Keep up with your regular service schedule for major household appliances. There’s no affordable way to replace these items if they fall into disrepair, but you can make them last longer by keeping them in good shape.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8reduceyourhomesliabilities\">8. Reduce your home’s liabilities</h3>\n<p>Don’t defer home maintenance. This message may be difficult to take if you’re trying to save up for something big, but it’s best not to leave a broken banister in place for a day longer than is necessary.</p>\n<p>This advice should be applied indoors and out: Keep steps and walkways up to code to reduce the likelihood that someone might trip or fall on your property. If these areas are out of line with local regulations, you may find yourself faced with mandatory upgrades or loss of homeowners insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>For example, a mortgage loan servicing specialist who has an inside view of the insurance industry shared how her homeowners insurance company once did a surprise outside inspection of her home. The insurance agent spotted a small staircase that led from the living room’s French doors to a patio behind the garage. Unfortunately, these steps weren’t up to code: there was no railing.</p>\n<p>Because this presented a potential <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> issue, the insurer contacted her to say they’d cancel her homeowners insurance if she didn’t bring the staircase up to code. She was happy to correct the problem, but she said it opened her eyes to the importance of keeping her home up in line with insurance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Proactive pointer</strong>: Keep your home up to code and make sure your homeowners insurance covers the features you have on your property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"savemoneybystayingontopofhomemaintenance\">Save money by staying on top of home maintenance</h2>\n<p>When you’re a first-time homeowner, it may seem like it takes superhuman organization skills to stay on top of all the things that need maintenance in any given month of the year. But experienced homeowners know that this gets easier with time.</p>\n<p>If you create and track a home maintenance schedule from day one, you may find it easier to get through your annual chores. But if making a system from scratch sounds daunting, you may find Kin’s <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">Home Maintenance Guide</a> useful.</p>\n<p>There will always be projects on deck and replacements to save up for, but the less maintenance you defer, the fewer surprises you’ll have along the way to becoming a veteran homeowner yourself.</p>"

    body: "<p>Homeowners insurance covers much more than your home. Learn about the six different coverage components a typical policy offers so you can be sure to get the most bang for your buck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebuildingblocksofyourhomeinsurancepolicy\">The Building Blocks of Your Home Insurance Policy</h2>\n<p>The six coverage categories are known as Coverages A–F, though they fortunately have more descriptive names as well. Not all coverage areas are included in all policies, and you can adjust each according to your desired coverage and need. As with most things, modifying the amount of coverage you buy will affect your premium.</p>\n<p>These categories have been approved and recommended through either of the two major rating bureaus, the <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/insurance/brands/iso/\"><strong>Insurance Services Office</strong></a> (ISO) or the <a href=\"https://aaisonline.com/\"><strong>American Association of Insurance Services</strong></a> (AAIS). These rating bureaus publish standard model insurance forms for insurance carriers to help consumers compare policies and streamline compliance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>Coverage A (aka dwelling insurance)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is the core of homeowners insurance. It covers your <a href=\"/glossary/\">dwelling</a>. If you don’t have Coverage A, you don’t have homeowners insurance! Coverage A includes the nuts and bolts of the home: the ceiling, walls, floors, anything structural. Be sure to understand the difference between the <a href=\"/glossary/\">replacement cost</a> coverage and <a href=\"/glossary/\">actual cash value</a> coverage. The latter includes depreciation, meaning that in the event of a loss, the policy may not appropriately cover rebuilding the home. Being underinsured can force you to pay out of pocket if you'd like to rebuild your lost home. In most cases, replacement cost is the more secure option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/other%20structures.jpg?width=300&name=other%20structures.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Coverage B (aka other structures insurance)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This covers “other structures” not connected to your home, like a detached garage, fence, or mailbox. Some insurers classify a pool under here as well. This is where you'll have to do some inventory -- the rule of thumb is that this coverage limit should be 10 percent of your Coverage A, but not all properties are created equal. If you only have a shed and a fence, you'd want less coverage than someone with a two-car detached garage and a barn. Most carriers will allow the coverage limit to be between 2 percent and 70 percent of Coverage A, so there's plenty of room to customize your policy.</p>\n<p>It's also important to reevaluate this part of your policy when you made additions to the property. If you put in a nice new fence, you might want to increase your Coverage B.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal%20property.jpg?width=300&name=personal%20property.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Coverage C (aka personal property insurance)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you were to pick up your home, flip it and shake it, what falls out counts as your personal property. This category is often the trickiest and can require expert consultation when buying homeowners insurance, because most policies have limits on especially valuable items like jewelry, artwork, and furs. You can get extra coverage for these items with what's called an \"endorsement,\" and this will allow you to affordably cover your treasured items. It’s important to explore whether a cash value policy or a replacement cost policy will work best for you and your family as well as to consider appropriate coverage limits. Typically folks elect a policy between 50 to 70 percent of the value of Coverage A, but if you have fewer valuable items, decreasing your Coverage C is usually a viable option to save money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/loss%20of%20use.jpg?width=300&name=loss%20of%20use.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Coverage D (aka loss of use insurance)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is coverage that many homeowners in disaster-prone areas should make sure to have. It covers any additional living expenses that come as a result of being unable to use your home. This includes a hotel if your home is unusable, or the restaurant costs if your kitchen is ruined and you're unable to cook your own meals. This coverage also extends beyond the length of your policy. So, if you're still in the hotel when your policy ends, the carrier should continue to pay your bill until you move back in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/liability.jpg?width=300&name=liability.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Coverage E (aka personal liability insurance)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This covers the insured when a claim is made against them for personal or property damage. Dog bites account for <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/press-release/dog-bite-homeowners-liability-claims-nationwide-increased-18-percent-california-florida-and-new-york-lead-nation-in-number-of-claims-040517\">more than one-third of all personal liability claims</a>, but other frequently covered claims include damaging another's property and paying medical bills if someone is injured on your property. This is why some carriers don't cover trampolines, or raise your rates if you own a dangerous (statistically speaking) dog breed. We offer $500,000 in personal liability coverage with all of our policies, which is generally the maximum amount of coverage you can get without an Umbrella policy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/medical%20expenses.jpg?width=300&name=medical%20expenses.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Coverage F (aka medical payments coverage)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Coverage F is designed to cover medical bills that arise as a result of an unintentional injury to others on your property. The decision to seek medical care is often a quick one, and this coverage foots those initial bills without regard to fault. There are exceptions to this that you can read about on our <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments insurance</a> page.</p>\n<p>When evaluating your homeowners insurance policy, it's important to keep your lifestyle in mind. Two homeowners in identical homes may have very different policies due to children, additional structures, or pets.

    body: "<p>The new tax plan impacts your deductions and property tax credits.</p>\n<p>As you may now be aware, the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/tax-reform\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which became law in late 2017, made changes to the tax code that may affect homeowners. Let’s look at what those changes are and ways you can adjust your finances if you aren’t able to deduct as much of your home-related expenses as you were in years past.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bighomeownerchange1spandataa11ynumberd10kspanlimitonstatelocaltaxes\">Big Homeowner Change #1: <span data-a11y-number>$10k</span> Limit on State &amp; Local Taxes</h2>\n<p>One major argument in favor of buying a home used to be that you could <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">save money on your taxes</a>. Specifically, the federal tax code pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act let homeowners deduct what they paid in state and local income taxes (commonly called SALT in the tax world) from their federally taxable income.</p>\n<p>So if you made $100,000 but paid $15,000 in SALT (including state income OR sales tax, property taxes, and whatever else you paid), your taxable federal income would be just $85,000 – before taking other deductions.</p>\n<p>But the new law limits the amount filers can deduct to just $10,000 of SALT expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>What that means for homeowners</strong>: As with any tax law, the effect this has will depend on the specifics of your situation. Generally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your total SALT expenses are $10,000 or less, you likely won’t see any change.</li>\n<li>If your total SALT expenses exceed $10,000, you <em>may</em> have a larger tax burden this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why the hedging? Because another important change took effect that will determine your tax bill: the standard deduction almost doubled, from $6,375 for individuals to $12,000 and from $12,700 to $24,000 for couples. The above deductions only matter if you opt to itemize your taxes instead of taking the standard deduction.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s situation is different, but generally, if your total available deductions don’t exceed the standard deduction amount, it’s probably easier and more cost-effective to take the standard deduction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Homeowners can now only deduct <span data-a11y-number>$10k</span> in state and local income taxes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"bighomeownerchange2spandataa11ynumberd750kspanlimitonmortgageinterestdeduction\">Big Homeowner Change #2: <span data-a11y-number>$750k</span> Limit on Mortgage Interest Deduction</h2>\n<p>Another reason owning a home offers some tax advantages is that you can deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage loan to lower your overall tax burden.</p>\n<p>Prior to this filing year, filers could deduct interest on mortgages up to $1 million; starting this year, though, the total mortgage value has been capped at $750,000 (or $375,000 for married couples filing separately).</p>\n<p><strong>What that means for homeowners</strong>: With the <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/home-values/\">median home price in the US</a> at about $230,000, most homeowners will likely be able to deduct all their mortgage interest (though obviously, home prices vary greatly by region).</p>\n<p>Like the SALT deduction cap, though, the mortgage interest cap could be affected by the increased standard deduction in that fewer taxpayers are likely to itemize this year. (In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxes has estimated that as many as <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/90-percent-taxpayers-projected-tcja-expanded-standard-deduction/\">88 percent of households</a> will opt for the new standard deduction.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4.6 million Americans​ are likely to see a smaller return than in years past. Another 4.6 million will owe money at tax time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/property-taxes-2.jpg?width=1920&name=property-taxes-2.jpg\" alt=\"property-taxes-2\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"smallerreturntrythesefinancialfixes\">Smaller Return? Try These Financial Fixes</h2>\n<p>While most Americans ended up with a lower overall tax burden in 2018, a change to withholding tables means that many will see smaller returns when they file this year: the IRS updated how employers are supposed to do withholdings for employees – that is, how much money employers withhold from regular paychecks to devote toward income taxes.</p>\n<p>As a result, the IRS estimates that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/02/10/millions-americans-could-be-stunned-their-tax-refunds-shrink/\">4.6 million Americans</a> are likely to see a smaller return than in years past and another 4.6 million who once got a return will this year owe money at tax time. Most of us saw our “return” money in dribs and drabs throughout the year, as slightly larger paychecks – but few of us noticed.</p>\n<p>So if you were counting on (or hoping for) a big, juicy tax return, you may be disappointed. But there are still a few steps you can take to either lower your tax burden this year or cut costs to make up for a smaller return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contribute to your IRA</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-time-guide-contribute-to-an-ira-by-april-15-to-claim-it-on-2018-tax-returns\">Contributions made by April 15, 2019</a>, can reduce your taxable income AND fund your retirement. If you’ve got some money lying around, this might be a win-win.</li>\n<li><strong>Know all the deductions</strong>: While the popular property tax deduction was lowered in the new law, other <a href=\"https://www.credit.com/taxes/quick-guide-common-tax-deductions-exemptions/\">deductions</a> still exist: charitable giving, certain medical expenses, green <a href=\"/blog/low-rates-a-remodel-away/\">home renovations</a>, and more. Depending on your circumstances, you may still get a better deal by itemizing this year – if you’re not sure, consult a tax professional.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase your withholdings</strong>: Increasing your withholdings through your employer can yield a larger return next tax season. Keep in mind, though: most personal finance professionals don’t recommend doing this because it amounts to giving a free loan to the government – but if you struggle with saving money, this can be an effective way to do it.</li>\n<li><strong>Start a new savings account</strong>: An alternative to increasing withholdings is to open a new savings account and setting up automatic deposits from each paycheck. If you put aside just $20 every week, you’ll have $1,040 in a year.</li>\n<li><strong>Start a brokerage account</strong>: Set up a brokerage account with a company like Fidelity or M1 Finance and funnel monthly deposits there. That way, you’ll earn interest on whatever you save.</li>\n<li><strong>Cut household expenses</strong>: If you were hoping for a tax-return windfall that didn’t materialize, make up the difference by looking for places to trim: could you bundle your cable, phone, and internet for savings? Or threaten to switch to a different provider to get discount? What about your home and auto insurance? When was the last time you <a href=\"/blog/survey-trust-in-new-insurers/\">shopped those policies around for savings</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, owning a home is about far more than getting tax breaks. But planning ahead now could mean a happier tax season next year.</p>"

But smart bathrooms are here, and you’ll find there are a ton of new technologies that can improve the comfort, convenience, and safety in one of the most important rooms in your house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisasmartbathroom\">What is a smart bathroom?</h2>\n<p>Smart bathrooms are equipped with technology that allows you to customize your bathroom experience. That often means it’s connected to mobile or networked devices that allow you to control your bathroom technology remotely.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, using your smartphone to turn on your shower before you get out of bed, or watching the news in your vanity mirror as you brush your teeth. Some people have even installed chromotherapy showers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsofsmartbathroomtechnology\">Benefits of smart bathroom technology</h2>\n<p>Many homeowners are drawn to smart technology that <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-technology/\">protects their homes</a>. Who doesn’t love the idea of turning on your lights before you get home or double checking your locks when you’re out on the town? The same can be true for smart bathroom technology like voice-activated night lights and touchless faucets and toilets.</p>\n<p>Convenience and comfort can also play a big role. Think personalized temperature settings, cabinets that keep medicines cool, and ventilation systems that automatically respond to humidity levels in your bathroom.</p>\n<p>But for all of the creature comforts and safety features available, smart bathrooms can also be great for your bank account. Many bathroom tech ideas are geared towards reducing water consumption. Plus, smart technology is in high demand and may increase your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/market-value-of-home/\">market value</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofsmartbathroomtechnologies\">Types of smart bathroom technologies</h2>\n<p>Wondering just how you can make your bathroom smarter? Here are some bathroom tech ideas to investigate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"warmingdrawersandracks\">Warming drawers and racks</h3>\n<p>Don’t use a cold towel or robe ever again. Instead, get a smart warming drawer or towel rack that lets you set the temperature and then has your smart system shut it off at the right time. You get towels at the perfect temperature whenever you want them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smarttoilets\">Smart toilets</h3>\n<p>Smart toilets can come with an amazing array of features. For example, you can get smart toilets with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in seat warmers so your bum doesn’t get shocked by a cold seat.</li>\n<li>Automatic lids that raise with the wave of your hand.</li>\n<li>Motion-activated night lights so you can see in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Self-cleaning features to lighten your household duties.</li>\n<li>Overflow detectors that stop you from flushing when there’s a clog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"smartshowers\">Smart showers</h3>\n<p>Smart showers can also have a variety of features. You’ll often find they have technology that allows you to control the temperature, water pressure, and shower duration with a smartphone app or in-shower controls. These features can also improve your shower’s efficiency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"voiceactivatedlighting\">Voice-activated lighting</h3>\n<p>Making your bathroom safer for anyone at risk for falls is enough of a reason to invest in voice-activated lighting. Plus, you can control more than the overhead lights with technology. You can get mirror lights that adjust on command to make it easier to put makeup on properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartmirrors\">Smart mirrors</h3>\n<p>Did you know that your mirror can become an information hub? Mirrors today can be interactive so you can set yours up with the day’s forecast, headlines, and traffic updates. That’s much simpler than trying to get ready while checking your phone or running out to catch the traffic report on your television.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartfaucets\">Smart faucets</h3>\n<p>Like smart showers, smart faucets can help you reduce water waste while also controlling temperature and pressure. You can find faucets that you work via your smartphone or that are activated by voice or motion, as well as one-touch faucets. These usually operate with just a single touch anywhere on the spout or handle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartbathmats\">Smart bath mats</h3>\n<p>Most bath mats do little more than lie on the floor. But smart bath mats can help you stay healthy by measuring your weight, body-mass index, and even your posture. That’s right! You can buy a smart mat that reminds you to stand tall just like your mom did when you were a kid. Some even record your information in a smartphone app and send you exercise suggestions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartwatersensors\">Smart water sensors</h3>\n<p>While they may not be as showy as some of our other bathroom tech ideas, smart water sensors can save you money should you have a leak. They detect water where there shouldn’t be any and alert you via your smartphone. Some even alert you to high humidity levels or pipes that are in danger of freezing. This gives you time to minimize damage to your home – which means less expensive repairs and easier clean up for you!</p>\n<p>There are a lot of positives to smart bathrooms, but remember that upgrading your technology can impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Some might require additional coverage. Others, like a smart water sensor, may result in a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">premium discount</a>. If you make an upgrade to your home, you may also have to <a href=\"/blog/when-to-update-home-insurance/\">update your homeowners policy</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Smart home technology is more than just a buzzword. From your smart refrigerators in your kitchen to smart plugs just about everywhere else, modern technology is making life faster and easier than ever before. Shouldn’t your home security be keeping pace?</p>\n<p>These days you have tons of options for keeping your property and loved ones safe. But only <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/smart-home-statistics\">46% of US households</a> actually use smart technology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isasmarthomesecuritysystemrightforyou\">Is a smart home security system right for you?</h2>\n<p>As you know, security systems can be a strong deterrent to would-be burglars, and they help protect your home from theft. However, today’s <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-technology/\">smart home security systems</a> can do far more than just protect your family and property from break-ins — they can help you manage your home, keep tabs on your family and pets, and even save you money down the line.</p>\n<p>Here are a few overlooked benefits of having a security system in your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getbettercontroloveryourhome\">1. Get better control over your home</h2>\n<p>Making <a href=\"/blog/low-rates-a-remodel-away/\">upgrades to your home</a> can make daily living more efficient and convenient, and some of today’s most popular home upgrades include smart technology:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart thermostats</li>\n<li>Automated door locks and lighting systems</li>\n<li>Smart sensors and detectors – even in your <a href=\"/blog/smart-bathroom-technology/\">bathroom</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although these individual upgrades are great on their own, they’re even more powerful when they work in harmony.</p>\n<p>That’s where a <a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/home-safety/21368618/best-home-security-companies\">good smart home security system</a> comes in. A wireless smart system is easy to install and operate, and its integrated technology makes it compatible with a number of smart home products. This can be a powerful feature that transforms your home security system into a one-stop hub for controlling smart home equipment throughout your home. Built-in schedules can automatically lock your doors and turn on the exterior lights, and you can manage it all with your smartphone. You’re always “at home,” even when you’re away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2keepyourfamilyconnected\">2. Keep your family connected</h2>\n<p>If your family always has a packed scheduled, a smart home security system can help you know who’s coming and going.</p>\n<p>Give every member of your family a separate key tag or pin code, and your security system can keep tabs on who is where throughout the day. Do your kids take the bus home from school when you’re still at work? When they unlock the door with their pin code, your smart lock can trigger a phone notification to let you know they’re home safely. Did your teen let the dogs out before going out with her friends? Check the security footage from your smart camera to be sure. It’s an easy way to keep your family on the same page (and maybe avoid some arguments).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3capturelifesbigmoments\">3. Capture life’s big moments</h2>\n<p>From a <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet</a> doing something funny to your kids celebrating a big achievement, life is full of moments you wish you captured on film. If your security system features WiFi-enabled smart cameras, it’s easy to make that happen!</p>\n<p>Although these camera systems are designed to spot potential intruders and catch package thieves in the act, they’re also great for recording first bike rides and identifying which pet tore up the couch. They’ll help your family sleep better at night and let your family have some fun at the same time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4saveandmakesomemoneydowntheline\">4. Save (and make) Some money down the line</h2>\n<p>As great as all of these features are, the bottom line is that a good home security system can <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save you money</a> over time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insurance providers typically offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts for security systems</a> (but talk to your agent to see which systems qualify).</li>\n<li>A quality home security product can add value to your property when it’s time to sell.</li>\n<li>Footage from your security system can make all the difference in getting stolen property back or <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">filing an insurance claim</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to consider adding a security system to your home as your next upgrade. The right system can boost your ability to monitor and protect your home, belongings, and family – and help you earn discounts on your home insurance.</p>\n<p>Wondering if there are more ways to make sure your home is really secure?

    body: "<h2 id=\"smarttechthatprotectsyourhome\">Smart Tech That Protects Your Home</h2>\n<p>Theft is a risk for any home. According to the Insurance Information Institute, about <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">one in 250 insured homes</a> makes a theft claim each year. Though it’s not the most frequent home insurance claim (that honor goes to property damage caused by wind and hail), theft can still cost more than homeowners may expect. The average theft claim runs about $4,146.</p>\n<p>So how can you keep your home safer and help prevent break-ins? Let’s look at how you can use <a href=\"https://porch.com/advice/high-tech-improvements-you-will-love-to-include-in-home\">smart home technology</a> to help protect your home from theft, vandalism, or intrusions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1upgradeyourlock\">1. Upgrade Your Lock</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re just leaving the house to go to work in the morning or you’re headed away for a week-long vacation, your first and most basic line of defense against burglars is a lock.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.z-wave.com/shop-z-wave-smart-home-products/category/smart-locks\">Smart locks</a> eliminate the question “Did I remember to lock the door?” These locks correspond to an app that lets you check on the status of your lock with your smartphone. Some smart locks even have anti-tampering technology. You receive a notification on your phone if someone tries to break your lock.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2keepaneyeoutfortrespassers\">2. Keep an Eye Out for Trespassers</h3>\n<p>Smart cameras and smart sensors also help boost your home’s security. These can alert you to unexpected visitors or trespassers through your smartphone.</p>\n<p>For example, say you install a <a href=\"https://www.z-wave.com/shop-z-wave-smart-home-products/category/smart-sensors\">smart sensor</a> that detects motion outside your house on your front porch. When the smart sensor detects motion, it will notify you via your smartphone so you know when someone is on your property.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3soundthealarm\">3. Sound the Alarm</h3>\n<p>If an intruder does enter your property, a smart siren may help scare them off. If it’s connected to your camera or sensor, these can trigger the siren to go off. You can often choose between audible sirens or flashing strobe lights.</p>\n<p>Some smart sirens will also send you a notification on your phone, so you can take action quickly to call the authorities to protect your home.</p>\n<p>Most smart home technology can be integrated into <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centrally monitored systems</a>, too. That’s worth noting if you want to take advantage of insurance discounts available to secure homes.</p>\n<p>To learn more about protecting your belongings while you’re away, check out “<a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-and-vacations/\">How Your Homeowners Insurance Protects You on Vacation</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>This guest post is brought to you by our friends at</em> <a href=\"https://www.z-wave.com\"><em>Z-Wave.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>"

    body: "<p>Who would have thought that watering the lawn could be such a hassle? The health and appearance of your yard depends on you knowing how much water to use and when to use it. That’s probably why smart sprinklers are becoming more and more popular among homeowners.</p>\n<p>Not only can a smart sprinkler help you get your lawn in tip-top condition, but it often helps you conserve water by using weather data, soil moisture sensors, and rain gauges to automate your watering schedule. Even better? Most smart sprinklers can be operated remotely so you can water your lawn from anywhere.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at five reasons you may want to invest in a smart sprinkler system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1costsavings\">1. Cost savings</h2>\n<p>Finding ways to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce energy bills</a> can be a challenge for homeowners. Like most smart technology, smart sprinklers are often designed to save you money by lowering your water costs. In fact, the use of smart sprinkler controllers may be able to save you between <a href=\"https://heroeslawncare.com/\">30% and 50%</a> on monthly water bills.</p>\n<p>Most smart sprinkler systems collect data through moisture sensors and rain gauges. Using that information lets the sprinkler adjust its watering schedule accordingly to use less water.</p>\n<p>There are two other ways smart sprinklers can usually help homeowners save money. First, sprinklers allow for remote operation, so you don't need to hire someone else to water your lawn when you’re away. You can do it from anywhere! Additionally, smart sprinklers require little maintenance, so you won't have to worry about costly repairs down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2waterconservation\">2. Water conservation</h2>\n<p>The only thing better than saving some green is <a href=\"/blog/how-to-go-green-this-winter/\">going green</a>, and smart sprinklers can help with that, too. The technology uses local weather data and soil moisture sensors to determine when and how much water is needed for each area of your lawn. By not over-watering areas with little sunlight or heavy shade, and avoiding watering during rainy days, a smart sprinkler conserves water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3convenience\">3. Convenience</h2>\n<p>Sprinklers can also make it easier to control your lawn's water needs. With a smart sprinkler, you can monitor and adjust the watering schedule remotely with an app or website. If there’s an unexpected change in the weather or you need to make a quick adjustment while you’re running errands, you can water your lawn easily from anywhere.</p>\n<p>How convenient a smart sprinkler system is for you depends a little bit on the type you get. Below are a few examples of the types of what’s currently available on the market:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WiFi-enabled sprinklers.</strong> You can get a smart sprinkler that connects to your home’s WiFi network. These are usually easy to set up, require minimal wiring, and allow you to access the sprinkler system via an app or website.</li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth-enabled sprinklers.</strong> Similar to WiFi-enabled ones, bluetooth-enabled sprinklers can be operated remotely. However, these sprinklers do not require a home WiFi network. Instead, they use bluetooth technology to connect with nearby devices, which makes them great for renters.</li>\n<li><strong>Battery-powered sprinklers.</strong> These sprinklers are powered by batteries, making them great for people who don't have access to a power outlet. Plus, they don't require any wiring or setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4sitespecificcontrol\">4. Site-specific control</h2>\n<p>Another great reason to get one of these high-tech sprinklers is that they allow for site-specific irrigation control. That means each zone of your lawn can be watered separately according to its own needs. For example, areas with heavy shade may require less frequent watering than areas in direct sunlight. Smart sprinklers can help tailor the water usage of each area accordingly, resulting in more efficient watering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5timersandalerts\">5. Timers and alerts</h2>\n<p>Live in an area impacted by drought? Or one that’s suddenly seeing more rain than normal? Either one can be hard on your lawn and hurt the look of your home no matter how creative you get with your <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">curb appeal ideas</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution may be a smart sprinkler with a specific timer for when it should turn on or off as well as an alert function to let you know you’re running low on water. A sprinkler like that can provide your lawn with just the right amount of water they need, so you don’t have to worry if they’re overwatering or underwatering.</p>\n<p>This can improve overall plant health and lower instances of diseases or pests because the sprinkler provides the best possible watering schedule for your plants. Some sprinklers even allow you to create customized watering schedules for each individual plant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Overall, these sprinklers are a great way to conserve water and save money at the same time. So if you're looking for an efficient and convenient way to keep your lawn looking its best, a smart sprinkler may be the way to go.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"cleanyourguttersanddownspouts\">Clean Your Gutters and Downspouts</h2>\n<p>Almost every article we write about home maintenance includes a tip for cleaning your gutters. It’s even one of our <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">six tips for preventing flood damage</a>. But there’s a good reason for this. Not only does pulling out the gunk that accumulates over the winter help stop pesky mosquitoes, but it also protects your home’s roof, walls, and foundation.</p>\n<p>You want to clean your gutters and downspouts before the heavy spring rains come. That way you can make sure the system drains properly and pushes water away from your home. Also inspect your gutters and downspouts for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cracks.</li>\n<li>Rust.</li>\n<li>Sagging.</li>\n<li>Water damage.</li>\n<li>Mold.</li>\n<li>Pooling water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These can be signs that your downspouts and gutters need to be replaced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkfortermites\">Check for Termites</h2>\n<p>Warm weather brings out all kinds of animals, and probably the least appreciated of these is termites. Subterranean termites, for example, start swarming in the spring, and that makes them particularly risky for your home.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">home insurance rarely covers termite damage</a>, so you want to find problems before they start. Here are a few signs of a termite infestation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small pinholes in your walls.</li>\n<li>Buckling or crumbling wood.</li>\n<li>Narrow tunnels, called mud tubes.</li>\n<li>Discarded termite wings.</li>\n<li>Peeling paint.</li>\n<li>Stuck doors and windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you aren’t sure if you’ve found an infestation, you may want to hire an exterminator to inspect your property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resealexteriorwood\">Reseal Exterior Wood</h2>\n<p>The wood around your house expands and contracts with the rise and fall of temperatures. This, plus moisture from winter ice and snow, can cause it to weaken, warp, and even rot. To protect against this, take the time to reseal your woodwork, like decks, fences, railings, and trellises.</p>\n<p>Before you buy sealant and get to work, note that you may have some repairs to make. Plus, you’ll want to give the wood a good scrubbing and sand the surface. This helps ensure that wood can absorb the new sealant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspectyourroof\">Inspect Your Roof</h2>\n<p>Winter storms do a number on your roof each year, so one of your most important spring maintenance tasks is to give it a good once-over. This isn’t to suggest that you should climb a ladder and inspect your roof ﹘ leave that to the professionals! But you can grab a pair of binoculars and look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damaged or missing shingles.</li>\n<li>Buckling or curling shingles.</li>\n<li>Mold, moss, and piles of leaves.</li>\n<li>Pooling water.</li>\n<li>Cracks in chimney or skylight seals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you see signs of a problem, get in touch with a roofer who can perform a more thorough inspection. That way, you may avoid a minor problem turning into a major leak in your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkasphaltandconcretepaths\">Check Asphalt and Concrete Paths</h2>\n<p>Winter weather can also cause asphalt, concrete, and other types of hardscaping materials to crack. That kind of damage is unattractive, but it can also create a tripping hazard for your guests.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the snow melting in the spring usually gives you a better idea of how much damage you have. You may be able to fix small cracks easily enough, but larger patches may require you to patch asphalt or replace concrete paths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testyoursprinklersystem\">Test Your Sprinkler System</h2>\n<p>Spring gets most homeowners thinking about their lawns and gardens, but neither will grow well if your irrigation system isn’t ready. Start by turning on your sprinklers to see what happens. Ideally, water comes out and there are no problems. However, you may find that some sprinkler heads are broken and need to be replaced.</p>\n<p>Once you’re sure the sprinklers are working, you want to check that they’re working in the right way. Adjust the sprinkler heads so they spray your flowers and grass ﹘ not your house, sidewalk, or street. Not only will your plants thank you, but your water bill may too!</p>\n<h2 id=\"examineyourscreens\">Examine Your Screens</h2>\n<p>One of the best parts of spring is opening up your doors and windows to let fresh air flow through the house. But that’s only enjoyable if you can also keep mosquitoes and flies out, so take a good look at the screens on your doors and windows. Fixing no rips and tears in your screens is surprisingly easy, and most home improvement stores have repair kits for under $20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"serviceairconditioner\">Service Air Conditioner</h2>\n<p>While the spring is usually moderate, summer temperatures are on the way. You can prepare for the hot months ahead by getting your air conditioning unit serviced. Technicians can clean your HVAC system to ensure it’s working efficiently. Some <a href=\"/glossary/home-warranty/\">home warranty plans</a> include this annual maintenance, so make use of it to keep your home cool and your electric bills down.</p>"

    body: "<p>Do your walls seem a little drab? Has it been a while since you updated your decor? If so, then maybe it’s time to shake things up a bit. The easiest way to do that is to introduce a new color to your home, and picking a color of the year ensures that your decor stays on trend.</p>\n<p>Several companies announce a color that they feel best encapsulates the spirit of the time. The best known of these is probably the Pantone color of the year, <a href=\"https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023\">Viva Magenta for 2023</a>, but others include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish Moss from Krylon.</li>\n<li>Redend Point from Sherwin-Williams.</li>\n<li>Raspberry Blush from Benjamin Moore.</li>\n<li>Vining Ivy from Glidden.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whichever color is your preference, bringing it into your home doesn’t require a major overhaul. We’ve listed a few simple ways to spruce up your home with the color of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decorativethrowsandpillows\">Decorative throws and pillows</h2>\n<p>Incorporating the color of the year is as easy as buying new pillows and throws. Tossed on a sofa or chairs, a Viva Magenta blanket can give your room the same joy and optimism that Pantone says the color displays. Plus, this option allows you to dip your toe in Pantone's color of the year without making a permanent change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newcurtains\">New curtains</h2>\n<p>Changing out your curtains for the season is a great way to keep a room contemporary and stylish. Even better, it's a simple and straightforward task to accomplish that requires minimal investment. Viva Magenta curtains, however, could dominate a room, so be sure to balance this choice with neutrals that either allow the color to stand out or a combination of warm and cool tones to create a harmonious effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newlampshades\">New lampshades</h2>\n<p>A lot of us don’t think about changing lampshades out when redecorating, but it’s an easy way to bring a little more color to a room that needs it while making an old lamp feel new. The key here is to minimize the change. Think about the type of lighting your lamp is for and choose a shade that keeps the hardware out of sight at eye level. Another option may be to spray paint your old lampshades with Krylon’s paint color of the year, <a href=\"https://www.krylon.com/en/colors/color-of-the-year\">Spanish Moss</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"artwork\">Artwork</h2>\n<p>Artwork can be a fun way to get a color of the year incorporated in your decor. Not only do you get to spend a day or two shopping for art, but you can decide just how bold you want to be. Do you want a giant wall hanging that’s all Viva Magenta or something more subtle with <a href=\"https://www.sherwin-williams.com/content/colorforecast/colormix-2023/color-of-the-year-2023\">Redend Point</a>, Sherwin-Williams’ color of the year, sprinkled throughout? Either can spruce up your home.</p>\n<p>If you’re crafty, you may want to go thrift shopping and use one of the paint colors of the year, like Benjamin Moore’s <a href=\"https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color-of-the-year-2023#PairingPalette\">Raspberry Blush</a>, to make something special for your home. That’s always a good way to <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">decorate your home on a budget</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accentwall\">Accent wall</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/color-of-the-year-wall.jpg\" alt=\"One living room wall in Viva magenta with a beige sofa and pale floors\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Painting an accent wall the color of the year can make a big impact on the space.</small></i><p></p>\n<p>An accent wall allows you to bring a bold color into your house without overwhelming a room. But of all our tips, this one is likely to require the biggest investment. Think carefully about which wall is the right choice for an accent color. For example, walls without architectural features are usually a good choice while neutrals can make your color of the year wall pop.</p>\n<p>Another consideration is the importance of color on the <a href=\"/blog/psychology-of-interior-design/\">psychology of interior design</a>. A wall in Viva Magenta will have a very different impact on your mood compared to one painted with Glidden’s <a href=\"https://www.glidden.com/trends\">Vining Ivy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoincorporatethecoloroftheyear\">How to incorporate the color of the year</h2>\n<p>Bringing one of these colors of the year into your home is just the first step; the next step is to make it work with your color palette. Luckily, there are few simple guidelines that may help.</p>\n<p>First, you may want to consult a color wheel. This is a tool that has all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors arranged by wavelength. Colors directly across from each other are considered complementary while those next to each other are described as analogous. Working within either of these ranges can help you coordinate your color palette.</p>\n<p>However, Viva Magenta may still cause you some trouble because it’s an unconventional and vibrant color from Pantone. Luckily, the company put together a <a href=\"https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023#:~:text=Explore%0Athe%20Magentaverse\">sample color palette</a> with light, soft neutrals to help you work Viva Magenta into your interior decor.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in April 2022.

As the survey results illustrate, nearly 59 percent of homeowners haven’t recently investigated home insurance offers, and the cost of their coverage may reflect that. Here’s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The marketplace is competitive</strong>. A good offer a few years ago may not stand up to the competition today.</li>\n<li><strong>Your credit score might’ve improved</strong>. A good credit score may positively impact your rates.</li>\n<li><strong>A home changes</strong>. You may have added safety features or updates that reduce your risk – and your insurance premium. Conversely, you might’ve removed risk factors (e.g., a trampoline or swimming pool) that increase your costs.</li>\n<li><strong>You may have a longer history of being claim-free</strong>. Carriers reward zero claims with lower insurance costs.</li>\n<li><strong>You may be able to take on a higher deductible</strong>. If you’re in a financial position to pay a little more out of pocket when you need to make a claim, accepting a slightly higher deductible can reduce your premium.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you don’t plan on switching insurance providers, it doesn't hurt to take a few minutes to make sure you’re getting a good deal on your coverage. Plus, if you’ve made significant updates to your home or purchased expensive personal items, you may need to adjust your home insurance, and renewal time is the perfect opportunity to make sure you’re adequately protected.</p>\n<p>See if you’re getting the best deal on your coverage.

However:</li>\n<li>14.5% would if it meant cheaper premiums.</li>\n<li>12.1% would if it meant better coverage.</li>\n<li>10.4% would if the company has positive customer reviews.</li>\n<li>8% would if the company has good claims service.</li>\n<li>6.1% would depending on the company’s financial rating.</li>\n<li>1.2% would if it were easy to get insured.</li>\n<li>33.5% of respondents have never changed home insurance providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"behindthenumbers\">Behind the Numbers</h2>\n<p>To be fair, our survey findings dovetail with recent polls. The <a href=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2017/10/16/172200.htm\">2017 World Insurance Report</a> found only 40 percent of policyholders trust their current providers, and only 26.3 percent of its respondents trust insurtechs (i.e., new insurance companies).</p>\n<p>In other words, trust in the insurance industry is already low, so it makes sense that homeowners may be hesitant to welcome newcomers.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the potential to save money and get better coverage are the biggest motivators for our respondents to take a leap on a new provider. The good news is that new insurance providers usually enter the market to help homeowners save on their premiums and to offer coverage to homeowners in regions that traditional insurers often neglect.</p>\n<p>That’s why Kin Insurance exists, at least.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>50% of policyholders who switched insurers in the last three years found a better price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"thecaseforshoppingyourhomeinsuranceregularly\">The Case for Shopping Your Home Insurance Regularly</h2>\n<p>When is the last time you changed home insurance providers?</p>\n<p><svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 450\" style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><desc>Insured homeowners on when they last switched home insurance providers.</desc><defs><rect height=\"270\" width=\"689\"></rect><rect x=\"-10\" y=\"-10\" height=\"290\" width=\"709\"></rect></defs><g class=\"scaler\" transform=\"scale(1)\"><rect width=\"800\" height=\"450\" fill=\"rgb(255, 255, 255)\" fill-opacity=\"1\"></rect><g class=\"canvas\" transform=\"translate(86,68)\"><g class=\"grid\"><g class=\"axis-grid x\" transform=\"translate(0,269)\"></g><g class=\"axis-grid y\" transform=\"translate(0,0)\"><line class=\"grid\" x1=\"0\" x2=\"689\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"0\" transform=\"translate(0,268)\" style=\"stroke: #232115;

A company representative should be able to answer questions about claim turnaround times.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the customer reviews.</strong> If nothing else, you can trust fellow customers to give you an honest impression of how they liked working with a new insurance provider. Check <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kin.com\">TrustPilot</a> and Consumer Reports. <a href=\"/reviews/\">Enthusiastic customers</a> are usually a strong indication that a new provider is doing good work.</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<p>A pool can add value to your home, but it can also add some insurance complications. That’s why this guide exists: to clear up some common questions we get about swimming pools.</p>\n<p>Find out what kind of pools we can cover, how they are covered under your home insurance policy, and exclusions you should know about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverswimmingpools\">Does homeowners insurance cover swimming pools?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> usually covers swimming pools, but most insurance companies consider pools to be <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a>, so you might need to meet some safety requirements before you can get covered. For example, at Kin, we prefer pools that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t have diving boards or slides.</li>\n<li>Have at minimum a four-foot fence with a locking gate (this can be your backyard fence).</li>\n<li>Are filled with water (they can’t be empty).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your pool meets these requirements, it can be covered. If a windstorm blew a branch into your pool that ripped the lining, your insurance could potentially pay for that repair.</p>\n<p>Your homeowners insurance also usually offers <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> for visitor injuries that happen in or around your pool. However, <a href=\"/blog/4-times-for-liability-insurance/\">pools do increase the risk of an injury</a> happening on your property, so check your coverage limits. If you need more protection, consider an umbrella policy. This can supplement your liability coverage limits without drastically increasing your home insurance premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverabovegroundoringroundpools\">Does homeowners insurance cover above ground or in-ground pools?</h2>\n<p>Home insurance can typically cover both above ground and in-ground pools. The difference between these two types of pools from an insurance standpoint is which part of the policy protects the pool.</p>\n<p>Our homeowners policies cover above ground pools under the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures coverage</a> (Coverage B) portion of your homeowners policy. In-ground pools, however, are under your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> (Coverage A).</p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> may do this differently. For example, some put both in-ground and above ground pools under Coverage B, while others use <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a> (Coverage C) for above ground pools because they can be disassembled and transported, like a trampoline.</p>\n<p>When in doubt about what part of your policy applies to your swimming pool, ask your insurance provider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpoolleaks\">Does homeowners insurance cover pool leaks?</h2>\n<p>Say your pool springs a leak. If the leak wasn’t caused by a covered peril (like a fire or windstorm), your policy typically won’t cover the damage. That’s because home insurance doesn’t pay for damage that results from <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">wear and tear</a> or lack of proper maintenance. In those cases, you’d have to pay for the repair and the leak cleanup out of pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverthepoolliners\">Does homeowners insurance cover the pool liners?</h2>\n<p>It depends on the situation. If your pool liner is damaged because of a covered incident (again, like a fire or windstorm), your policy may pay to repair or replace the liner. However, if your pool liner rips under other circumstances, such as neglect or wear and tear, the repair isn’t covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isyourhurricanescreenedenclosurecovered\">Is your hurricane screened enclosure covered?</h2>\n<p>It depends on where you live. For example, you may be able to protect your pool’s hurricane enclosure with an endorsement to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>. The enclosure usually isn’t covered by the portion of your policy that protects your pool.</p>\n<p>Kin offers this endorsement for Florida homeowners, but be aware that it pays to repair or replace the frame of the enclosure – not the screening material.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesapoolimpactyourinsurancepremiums\">How does a pool impact your insurance premiums?</h2>\n<p>Because a pool is both an additional investment and an additional risk, it does raise the cost of your homeowners insurance premium.</p>\n<p>If your insurer classifies your pool as an external structure, the default is to cover it (and the rest of your other structures) for up to 10 percent of your dwelling insurance. So if, for example, your dwelling coverage limits are $250,000, you would have up to $25,000 in protection for your pool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepingyourswimmingpoolsafe\">Tips for keeping your swimming pool safe</h2>\n<p>Insurance is only the first step towards protecting your home when you have a pool. The next is managing the added risk. Here are few ideas for helping keep your swimming pool safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Erect a locking fence around your pool to keep children and pets out of the water. Make sure the fence is locked and the pool secure when you aren’t around.</li>\n<li>Mount lights by your pool to keep the area well lit at night so no one falls in.</li>\n<li>Install one or more security cameras that let you monitor activity in and around the pool.</li>\n<li>Avoid installing diving boards, slides, and other accessories that people may injure themselves on.</li>\n<li>Keep the pool deck dry and free of debris to minimize the chance of accidents.</li>\n<li>Keep the pool and surrounding area free of any glass that might break and get in the pool and cut someone.</li>\n<li>Make sure that anytime the pool is being used there’s an adult present who is trained to perform CPR in the event of an emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Need more guidance? Give us a call! We’re happy to help you protect your pool.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in September 2018.

    body: "<p>There's a pretty big misconception when it comes to taxes: that making a little more money is a bad thing if it bumps you into a new tax bracket. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how federal taxes – and tax brackets – work.</p>\n<p>Given that the average American pays approximately<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/taxes/2018/04/22/how-much-does-the-average-american-pay-in-taxes.aspx\"> $10,500 in personal taxes</a> every year – or 14 percent of the average income in a household – it makes sense that folks might be concerned about an increase in <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">taxes</a>. But because the US tax system operates on <strong>marginal tax brackets</strong>, you only pay more on the income above the new tax bracket’s threshold. Let's break it down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisamarginaltaxbracket\">What Is a Marginal Tax Bracket?</h2>\n<p>Marginal tax brackets are how federal taxes are broken down to help equalize the amount every person pays in taxes.</p>\n<p>The marginal tax bracket is the percentage rate applied to your income in each of the tax brackets you meet. That might sound very technical, but all it really means is that if you jump from a 22 percent to a 24 percent tax bracket, only the amount <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp\">above the income threshold</a> is taxed at the new bracket.</p>\n<p>Here's an example. In 2020, you need to make $85,525.01 to be in the 24 percent tax bracket. Assume you are single and make $82,000 during the year before you get a $5,000 raise. The raise isn’t going to tax all of your income at the new 24 percent rate.</p>\n<p>Only the amount over $85,525 is taxed at 24 percent. In this case, that's $1,475: <strong>$82,000 + $5,000 - $85,525 = $1,475.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Essentially, only the additional dollars of income over the tax bracket’s threshold is taxed at the new rate.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"howtocalculateyoureffectivetaxrate\">How to Calculate Your Effective Tax Rate</h2>\n<p>In the example above, saying that you are in the 24 percent tax income bracket is true but still not completely representative of how much you pay Uncle Sam in taxes. What you really pay is called an “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp\">effective tax rate</a>” – a number that is a true indicator of the percentage of your income you pay in taxes.</p>\n<p>To calculate your effective tax rate:</p>\n<p><strong>Effective Tax Rate = Total Tax / Taxable Income</strong></p>\n<p>We looked at how only a portion of your total post-raise income would be taxed at 24 percent, but remember that not all of your pre-raise income was taxed at 22 percent (the tax bracket just below). Once you hit the 24 percent tax bracket, you now have money being taxed at the 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, and 24 percent thresholds.</p>\n<p>Here’s how your tax breakdown would look:</p>\n<p>| Tax Rate | Total Income within Each Bracket | Taxes Paid |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1o% | $9,875 | $987.50 |\n| 12% | $30,250 | $3,630 |\n| 22% | $45,400 | $9,988 |\n| 24% | $1,475 | $354 |\n| TOTAL | $87,000 | $14,959.50 |</p>\n<p>Instead of 24 percent, your effective tax rate is $14,959.50 / $87,000 = .1719 or 17.19 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thecurrenttaxbrackets\">The Current Tax Brackets</h2>\n<p>The threshold in each bracket typically goes up each year to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp\">account for inflation</a> and standard wage rises. The two charts bellow illustrate the changes in the tax tables from 2019 to 2020. If you are working on your 2019 federal tax return, the first chart for 2019 will help you understand where your income is in relation to the tax bracket thresholds. The 2020 tax table is to help you budget your tax liabilities for the current tax year.</p>\n<p>| IRS 2019 Tax Income Brackets |\n| --- |\n| Rate |\n| 10% |\n| 12% |\n| 22% |\n| 24% |\n| 32% |\n| 35% |\n| 37% |</p>\n<p>| IRS 2020 Tax Income Brackets |\n| --- |\n| Rate |\n| 10% |\n| 12% |\n| 22% |\n| 24% |\n| 32% |\n| 35% |\n| 37% |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/what-are-tax-brackets/L8jeM6XaJ\"><em>Intuit</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"deductionsandyourtaxbracket\">Deductions and Your Tax Bracket</h2>\n<p>Deductions reduce your taxable income. These are normally deducted from the gross income to help reduce the amount you pay in the highest tax bracket. In some cases, deductions can help bring you down to a lower tax bracket if you were just above the threshold because they are a dollar-for-dollar reduction of income.</p>\n<p>Assume you have a $1,500 tax deduction for mortgage points paid when you closed escrow. Your income is now reduced by that exact amount. A deduction often helps those in higher tax brackets more than those in lower ones.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the math works: the tax savings for someone in a 32 percent tax bracket on $1,500 means you reduce your income by $1,500 and save $480 in taxes. The same deduction for someone in a 12 percent tax bracket is only $180.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the dollar-for-dollar deduction can be a huge help to reduce your tax bracket and therefore reduce what you owe in taxes. Remember the example of the person making $82,000 getting a $5,000 raise and being bumped into a higher tax bracket by $1,475? That $1,500 deduction brings that same person back down to the 22 percent tax bracket and eliminates that $354 in the 24 percent tax income bracket.</p>\n<p>This is why keeping excellent records of all deductions is helpful. The most common tax deductions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortgage points:</strong> The prepaid interest on your home loan to help reduce your overall monthly costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Charitable contributions:</strong> Donations made in cash or items to IRS 501(c)(3) organizations.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical and dental expenses:</strong> Costs totaling over 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income paid for medical and dental care.</li>\n<li><strong>Property taxes:</strong> Amount paid to local assessor or <a href=\"/blog/smaller-property-tax-credit/\">property tax</a> division.</li>\n<li><strong>Work-related education expenses:</strong> Tuition, books, lab fees, and some transportation costs can be deducted when they help you improve or maintain employment skills.</li>\n<li><strong>State, local, and sales taxes:</strong> Amount paid to state and local municipalities as well as the sales tax on large purchases such as cars, appliances, and materials for home improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal casualty losses:</strong> Victims of natural disasters such as hurricanes may be eligible to claim the loss as a tax deduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taxes are complicated. It’s important to review your personal situation with a tax advisor to make sure you are maximizing all deductions and other tax credits you may be eligible for.</p>"

    body: "<p>On average, homeowners pay $2,375 on property taxes for their home each year. Good thing being a homeowner means you get to take property tax deductions – and a whole lot more. To take advantage of these breaks, you just need to implement a few tax planning strategies.</p>\n<p>Knowing what you can deduct and how it compares to a standard deduction lets you make the most of expenses that are fully or partially deductible. Let’s take a look at the common homeownership <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">tax deductions</a> as well as other household expenses that could save you in taxes. *</p>\n<p><em>*This guide is for educational use only and should not be construed as tax advice. Please see a professional CPA or tax preparer for your specific tax planning purposes.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"taxplanningstrategy1knowyourhomeownershipdeductions\">Tax Planning Strategy #1: Know Your Homeownership Deductions</h2>\n<p>You may have heard many times that buying a house is a great way to save on taxes. That's because you can take more deductions than someone who rents. Be aware that <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance premium</a> isn't tax deductible, but plenty of other expenses are.</p>\n<p>Here are some common deductions for homeowners.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propertytaxes\">Property Taxes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/florida-property-tax-exemptions/\">Property taxes</a> are the amount paid to the county you live in. Some counties, even in the same state, are higher than others depending on local tax laws. On average, Florida residents have a <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/taxes/florida-property-tax-calculator\">0.98 percent effective property tax rate</a>, and the average homeowner pays $1,752 in taxes. That's about $300 less than the national average.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mortgageinterest\">Mortgage Interest</h3>\n<p>Mortgage interest is the interest on the loan to pay for your home. You can deduct what you paid in interest for the calendar year. And that interest adds up. Say, for example, you bought a home for $260,900 with 4.44 percent interest on a 30-year fixed-rate loan. If you put 20 percent put down and your loan is $208,720, you'd pay $169,390 in interest during the 30-year loan term. That's $5,646 paid annually – a sizable deduction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"privatemortgageinsurance\">Private Mortgage Insurance</h3>\n<p>Private <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a> is required on loans where less than 20 percent is put down on the house. It's intended to protect the lender if stop making payments on the loan. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/avoid-pmi/\">PMI rates vary from 0.5 percent to 1 percent</a> of the loan amount and can easily be several thousand dollars a year.</p>\n<p>The ability to deduct PMI may be in jeopardy unless Congress extends the deduction. The <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/is-pmi-tax-deductible/\">Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020</a> allows taxpayers to deduct PMI from the years 2018 through 2020.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pointsonyourloan\">Points on Your Loan</h3>\n<p>This is a deduction to consider in the year you purchased or refinanced your home. Points are paid to a borrower to reduce your interest rate. One point is equal to 1 percent in interest on the mortgage loan. These are also called <a href=\"https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/deductions-and-credits/how-do-i-deduct-points-paid-on-my-mortgage-9305/\">discount points or loan origination fees</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taxplanningstrategy2considerothertaxdeductions\">Tax Planning Strategy #2: Consider Other Tax Deductions</h2>\n<p>Maximize your deductions by considering what else the IRS allows you to itemize and deduct against your income. Record keeping is essential to make sure you get the most out of your <a href=\"/blog/smaller-property-tax-credit/\">tax deductions</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"medicalanddentalexpenses\">Medical and Dental Expenses</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc502\">Medical expenses</a> that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income are deductible on your tax return. These expenses include all out-of-pocket costs (included deductibles and co-pays) to doctors and dentists. It also includes the cost of hospital visits, psychotherapy, doctor prescribed weight loss or smoking programs, prescriptions, and medical aids such as wheelchairs, crutches, and guide dogs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"charitablegifts\">Charitable Gifts</h3>\n<p>The money you put in the basket at church, the bag of clothes you donated to the thrift store, and the monthly sponsorship of an endangered animal are examples of <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions\">charitable contributions</a>. Generally speaking, you can deduct up to 60 percent of your adjusted gross income with these contributions, but make sure they are made to an IRS-recognized 501(c)3 and that you have a receipt. Not all charitable contributions are deductible up to 60 percent, either. Contributions to private foundations, fraternal societies, and veterans organizations may have lower limits ranging from 20 to 50 percent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jobexpenses\">Job Expenses</h3>\n<p>Self-employed individuals will file a Schedule C for all business expenses including supplies, utilities, marketing, and operational expenses. You can also deduct the cost of certain tools or uniforms that the employer requires but doesn't reimburse. For example, a K-12 teacher is able to deduct up to $250 per year for educator expenses. A security officer can deduct uniform expenses not paid for or reimbursed by their employer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uninsuredcatastrophiccasualtyortheftlosses\">Uninsured Catastrophic Casualty or Theft Losses</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/forms/form-4684/\">Property losses</a> that <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn't cover but that were caused by a federally declared disaster are tax-deductible. The loss must be more than 10 percent of your adjusted gross income and you must subtract $100 from the total loss. Eligible losses may be caused by earthquakes, <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">floods</a>, fires, terrorist attacks, vandalism, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"salestaxonmajorpurchases\">Sales Tax on Major Purchases</h3>\n<p>Sales taxes on major purchases can also be deducted, though many homeowners often overlook this tax break. This could include the sales tax on a car, boat, appliances, electronics, or materials for a home renovation. For example, if you bought a new car for $42,000 in <a href=\"http://www.salestaxstates.com/sales-tax-calculator-florida\">Florida with a 6 percent sales tax</a>, you can deduct $2,520 for the sales tax on your itemized return.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Home renovations can increase the value of your home and help you maximize profits when you sell it. If you bought your home for $250,000 and put $30,000 into a new kitchen, keep track of the records to have a <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/determining-your-homes-tax-basis.html\">new cost basis</a> of $280,000 when you sell it, reducing potential capital gains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taxplanningstrategy3knowwhenthestandarddeductionisbetter\">Tax Planning Strategy #3: Know When the Standard Deduction Is Better</h2>\n<p>Add up all your itemized deductions on Schedule A to see what the total is. If your itemized deductions are less than the standard deduction, opting for the standard deduction allows you to file a simplified tax return – generally at less risk of an audit – than an itemized return.</p>\n<p>Here are the 2019 standard deductions.</p>\n<p>| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |\n| --- | --- |\n| Single | $12,200 |\n| Head of Household | $18,350 |\n| Married Filing Joint | $24,400 |</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-deductions-and-credits/what-are-standard-tax-deductions/L7oiVM1DH\"><em>Intuit</em></a></p>\n<p>What that means is you can automatically reduce your taxable income by the amount of the deduction. If you have more than the standard deduction in deductions, an itemized deduction may be the way to go. Talk with your financial advisor or tax preparer to determine which path is right for your financial goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretoputyourdeductionsonyourtaxreturn\">Where to Put Your Deductions on Your Tax Return</h2>\n<p>How you file your tax return depends on whether you take the standard deduction or itemized deductions. Those taking the standard deduction get the benefit of filing a Form 1040A (formerly referred to as a Form 1040EZ). Those who itemize deductions must file Form 1040 and complete a Schedule A.</p>\n<p>Don’t let the number of lines scare you from filing the Schedule A. Use every line time to determine whether you are eligible for other tax deductions to reduce your tax burden further. You aren’t required to have something on every line.</p>\n<p>When filing your deductions, make sure you have good records in case you get audited. You aren’t required to turn your records in when filing, but most experts suggest keeping them for at least seven years after filing.</p>\n<p>Use Schedule A to calculate the total value of your itemized deductions. <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/f1040sa.pdf\">Schedule A</a> is broken down into major categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lines 1-4</strong>: Medical and dental expenses</li>\n<li><strong>Lines 5-7</strong>: Taxes you paid (including property taxes on line 5b)</li>\n<li><strong>Lines 8-10</strong>: Interest you paid</li>\n<li><strong>Lines 11-14</strong>: Gifts to charity</li>\n<li><strong>Line 15</strong>: Casualty and theft losses (uninsured)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note any major purchases you made for your house (or life) as well. The sales taxes on appliances, cars, boats, etc. are deductible on Line 5c.</p>\n<p>Most tax software does a good job of walking you through what is the best way to file your taxes, either as a Form 1040A or Form 1040 with a Schedule A. But knowing what you can deduct helps you have the right records on hand.</p>"

    body: "<p>We have a lot to be thankful for, but one thing’s for sure: this Thanksgiving will be unlike any other because of the pandemic. And if you’re like most folks, this time of you has you wondering how to safely celebrate the holidays with your loved ones.</p>\n<p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) warns that gatherings with friends and family increases the chance of spreading COVID-19. It also warns against traveling, noting \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\" If you’re planning on having a family gathering beyond your immediate household for a Thanksgiving feast, consider these tips to keep everyone <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">safe during and after the holiday</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thanksgivingsafetytips\">Thanksgiving safety tips</h2>\n<p>Before your family gathers, set expectations if you’re following CDC recommendations and social distancing guidelines. That way your family can prepare in advance, which can reduce friction during the feast.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the CDC suggests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1wearamask\">1. Wear a mask</h3>\n<p>You’ve heard it a million times and you’ll probably hear it a million more, but wearing a mask is essential. The CDC recommends using cloth masks because they reduce the spread of the infection.</p>\n<p>And it benefits everyone.</p>\n<p>When you wear a mask, you have less exposure to infectious droplets. If you’re asymptomatic, a mask reduces the chance of inadvertently spreading the virus.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: if you aren’t eating, wear a mask. When you aren’t wearing your mask, put it in a plastic bag in your pocket to prevent it from accidental exposure to germs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2maintain6feetofsocialdistance\">2. Maintain 6 feet of social distance</h3>\n<p>Of course you’ll want to hug Grandma at the holiday feast, but if she isn’t part of your everyday household, that increases the chance of her getting sick.</p>\n<p>Assume anyone can be a carrier of COVID and maintain your distance – both while socializing and eating. Spread chairs apart so that everyone has a safe personal space.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3washyourhands\">3. Wash your hands</h3>\n<p>The best way to avoid getting sick and spreading the illness is to frequently and thoroughly <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-coronavirus/\">wash your hands</a>. As the host, make sure there are plenty of disposable towels in the bathroom so that everyone isn’t using the same hand towel.</p>\n<p>In addition to washing your hands in the bathroom or before handling food, wash them after touching high-contact surfaces and objects, like door knobs, keys, or belongings from outside your home.</p>\n<p>It’s also smart to keep hand sanitizer in the bathroom, dining room, and kitchen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4bringyourowneverything\">4. Bring your own … everything</h3>\n<p>It may sound unfestive, but the CDC recommends that guests bring their own food and drinks so there’s less risk of contamination. We know that might not be practical for everyone, but if your family is willing, try it.</p>\n<p>For example, it might be easier for family members to come with their own drinks or appetizers while you handle the main meal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5preplatedinners\">5. Pre-plate dinners</h3>\n<p>If your family usually does Thanksgiving buffet style, this might be the year to avoid it. The CDC recommends having one designated person to handle and plate the food to limit exposure. That limits the amount of folks touching utensils and potentially spreading germs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6choosesingleserveoptions\">6. Choose single-serve options</h3>\n<p>Purchase single-serve items where possible, including pre-dinner snacks (think: crackers or chips, soft drink cans rather than two-liter bottles, and single-serve condiments and salad dressing. That will reduce the number of people handling jars and bottles.</p>\n<p>If you can’t provide single-serve options, assign one person to handle serving items out of jars or bottles to reduce how many people contact them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7usedisposableitems\">7. Use disposable items</h3>\n<p>While “good china” may be for family feasts, this is the year to use disposable serving trays, paper goods, and plastic utensils. Not only will this help reduce virus exposure, but it will also make cleaning up easier for everyone. Maybe you can spend that time socializing instead – socially distanced, of course!</p>\n<h3 id=\"8hostthemealoutdoorsifpossible\">8. Host the meal outdoors (if possible)</h3>\n<p>There’s less risk of transmission when you’re outdoors in the free-flowing air. It’s also easier to social distance in a backyard. If you do need to stay indoors because of the weather, try to open as many windows as possible to keep airflow moving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9limitguests\">9. Limit guests</h3>\n<p>Limiting guests really means limiting households. While some cities say to limit guests to five or 10 at the most, think about limiting other households coming in. Everyone in a household has the same exposure level. By limiting the number of households, you reduce the exposure even when you have more people. For example, two households with five people each has less exposure than five households with two people.</p>\n<p>All of us at Kin wish you a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Stay healthy, and enjoy the time with your family, however you choose to celebrate.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you’ve ever applied for home insurance, you’ve probably felt like you were being quizzed on how well you know your home. You may have even encountered questions you weren’t sure how to answer, like “How is your roof attached to your walls?” And if you’re like us, you may have wondered why it has to be that way.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: it doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Though those answers are important, your input isn’t the only way to get them. It’s often more accurate when homeowners <em>aren’t</em> tasked with providing that information.</p>\n<p>We still use the data any insurer needs to determine your risk, coverage, and premium, but we use more than 10,000 data points and scientific validation to reduce the number of questions you have to answer.</p>\n<p>In fact, one of the key results from a third-party competitor analysis revealed how few property detail questions we ask compared to other insurtechs, like Lemonade, Hippo, Branch, and Gabi.</p>\n<p>And just like that, insurance gets so much easier!</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingpropertydatatosimplifyhomeinsurance\">Using Property Data to Simplify Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>Consumers expect a user-friendly digital experience, even with insurance. In a <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/chubb-more-than-half-of-home-insurance-consumers-look-for-coverage-online-160492.aspx\">2019 study</a>, 53 percent of participants said that they shopped online for homeowners insurance and 61 percent said that they are likely to shop online for home insurance in the future. But, as an <a href=\"https://insuranceblog.accenture.com/customers-experience-demands-illustrate-the-importance-of-insurers-going-digital-now\">Accenture report</a> noted, most online insurance experiences are still lacking. Nearly 75 percent of shoppers ran into problems when buying coverage online. Almost a quarter of respondents said the process was too complicated while another 22 percent complained it took too long.</p>\n<p>Home insurance applications don’t have to be so long and confusing. Much of the information that other insurance companies collect manually can be sourced other ways, so we developed technology to gather and evaluate it. Basically, we take the complexity out of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to speeding up and simplifying the buying process, our use of objective external data also increases underwriting and pricing accuracy. While most folks are experts on what makes their house a home – its nooks and crannies, the floorboard that creaks – most would have to guess about <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">the shape of their roof</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewegetpropertydataandhowweuseit\">Where We Get Property Data and How We Use It</h2>\n<p>Unlike many of our competitors who rely on the homeowner or only pull data from one source, we work with dozens of vendors and pull data from public records and real estate listings to ingest thousands of attributes, such as the home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construction.</li>\n<li>Roof type, age, and material.</li>\n<li>Square footage and number of stories.</li>\n<li>Build date.</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Basement type.</li>\n<li>Finish quality.</li>\n<li>Foundation type.</li>\n<li>Number of stories.</li>\n<li>And much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also leverage geospatial data, which helps us understand exposure to catastrophic risk and <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-ida-case-study/\">respond to disasters</a>.</p>\n<p>To help us use all the information we gather, we built a few tools that automate, predict, and analyze it for greater accuracy and efficiency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maestro</strong> is a digital platform that collects, prioritizes, and generates millions of data points from external and internal data sources. It’s the technology we use to prefill data when you apply for a quote from Kin.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinfidence</strong> is the name of our artificial intelligence (AI) that uses the data from Maestro to score our level of confidence in certain data points in near real-time. This helps us speed up the process for customers with significantly less data input.</li>\n<li><strong>Kin Bot</strong> automates repetitive tasks, like reviewing and validating documents to support the data we collect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If for any reason we can’t verify your data with our technology, we bring in our amazing (and human!) Kin team to validate it and further train our models.</p>\n<p>We only use our data and AI to the extent that it reduces bias, increases objectivity, and offers more accurate information about the home. We have never used (and have no plans to use) any biometric data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdataprefilleliminatesextrahomeinsurancequestions\">How Data Prefill Eliminates Extra Home Insurance Questions</h2>\n<p>Much of the data we collect with these tools answers questions we use to determine your home insurance coverage and premium. We’re almost always able to prefill (and not have to ask you about) property details like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Square footage</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms</li>\n<li>Roof shape</li>\n<li>Overall quality</li>\n<li>Number of stories</li>\n<li>Foundation type</li>\n<li>Year built</li>\n<li>Roof material</li>\n<li>Foundation shape</li>\n<li>Exterior wall finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"discoversmarterinsurance\">Discover Smarter Insurance</h2>\n<p>The best way to test our tech?

    body: "<p>Today, people take insurance for granted in many ways. They assume insurance companies will be around to cover their losses should the worst case scenario become their unfortunate reality.</p>\n<p>At one point, however, the idea of insurance was unheard of. Pooling risk so anyone impacted by a catastrophe can rebuild their home without being put on the street? How revolutionary! But you might be surprised to learn that the concept of <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-1800-1900-insurance-policies/\">insurance dates back several centuries</a>. We take a look at the insurance industry’s murky beginnings to see how this far-out idea made its way to America.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoriginsofinsurance\">The origins of insurance</h2>\n<p>Insurance existed in one form or another all the way back to ancient times. In the early 1900s, archeologists found artifacts dating back to Hammurabi that contain laws protecting shipper agents from losses caused by natural disasters and relieving them of liability when they were victims of theft.</p>\n<p>Similar archeological discoveries revealed several other instances of early laws that transferred or distributed risk in many nations, including China, India, and Greece as well as the Roman Empire. These laws mainly dealt with protecting the people who shipped cargo from the devastating losses that can happen on sea voyages.</p>\n<p>The desire to protect business from these kinds of losses continued during the medieval period. That’s when the king of Portugal created a fund that’s considered the first documented form of maritime insurance in Europe. It wasn’t until the 1600s that the various lines of insurance started taking shape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeinsurancegotitsstart\">How home insurance got its start</h2>\n<p>The Great Fire of London is regarded as the genesis of modern insurance. Insurance existed in various forms before this, but it lacked the rigor and formality of today’s policies. In the 17th century, each policy only covered one peril (i.e., one thing that could go wrong).</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that during the time <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> originated, homes were primarily made of wood. Wood structures burn easily, which posed a problem. To compound that problem, developers built homes closer and closer together as the population grew, which increased the fire risk. People began to understand the importance of protecting their homes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurancecrossesthepond\">Insurance crosses the pond</h2>\n<p>Fast forward to 1732. Insurance has made its way to Charles Town (modern day Charleston), South Carolina, where the first company to cover fire insurance was founded. It wasn’t until 20 years later that noted insurance entrepreneur Benjamin Franklin popularized the coverage. His company, Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (which is still in business) was formed in 1752. The company was instrumental in helping people prevent fires and setting industry precedents.</p>\n<p>In the next century, insurance took off around the United States. What began as just insuring the home against fire quickly blossomed into a full-fledged, lucrative sector: life (which was originally designed to help widows and children), theft, disability, commercial, and auto insurance, to name a few.</p>\n<p>If insurance had not changed, a modern homeowner would need separate policies for fire insurance, lightning insurance, burglary insurance, and so on. Today, all of these are now covered by a <a href=\"/blog/not-so-basic-home-insurance/\">basic homeowners insurance policy</a>. It wasn’t until 1950 that the first packaged home insurance product was sold.</p>\n<p>Growth continued from there. In 1960, the Boston Plan identified insurance availability issues found in urban areas of Boston and took action to address them. The current National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has its start with the 1968 passing of the National Flood Insurance Act. This is the foundation of all flood insurance policies sold today and sets the standards for private flood insurance. By this time, homeowners were already fully appreciating the benefits of standard homeowners insurance policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedevelopmentofregulations\">The development of regulations</h2>\n<p>At this point in history, insurance was more or less a free-for-all: regulations were basically nonexistent, monopolies were forming, and minority groups were excluded. Carriers charged consumers whatever they wanted for premiums, and were often not able to pay out on claims (like a Ponzi scheme).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the government made gradual regulatory headway in the private insurance sector.</p>\n<p>The Social Security Act of 1935, which guaranteed citizens’ rights to unemployment insurance, and the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which shifted governing authority for the insurance industry to the states, were two of the most notable regulations.</p>\n<p>With this oversight (as well as good old-fashioned constant competition), insurance companies have had to eliminate discriminatory practices, offer more competitive prices, and pay out verifiable claims.</p>\n<p>After looking back at the history of homeowners insurance, we’re even more excited to be able to be a part of the next round of fundamental insurance innovation - a better buying process, more accurate risk pricing, and efforts that help homeowners actively avoid damage to their home.</p>"

    body: "<p>You’ve seen the memes. In fact, you’ve probably taken the Florida Man Birthday Challenge – the one where you enter your birthdate and “<a href=\"/floridaman/\">Florida man</a>” in Google and see what whacky headlines pop up: “Florida Man Strips Naked After Car Crash.” “Florida Man Mistakes Birdbath for Pool.” “Florida Man Sets House on Fire While Scaring Gators Away.”</p>\n<p>Funny, right? There’s a headline for every occasion.</p>\n<p>What often goes unsaid is that while the meme is entertaining, it’s also pretty unfair. The only reason anyone even hears wild stories out of Florida is that the state has good public record laws. Authorities make just about every document created by a public agency available to the media, which is something we should applaud, not ridicule.</p>\n<p>But when the media runs a whacky Florida Man story, they're rewarded with better ratings and more clicks. Which encourages them to find more Florida Man stories. Which bumps their ratings. Which encourages more stories.</p>\n<p>It’s a vicious cycle – and one Florida doesn’t deserve.</p>\n<p>We’ve been here for five years now, so we know just how great Florida is. As far as we’re concerned, the rest of the country can laugh at the memes. We’d rather show who Floridians really are, which is why we made our film “Florida, Man.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"/floridaman/\">Watch it here</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"itsnotalwayssunnyinthesunshinestate\">It’s not always sunny in the Sunshine State</h2>\n<p>Maybe the reason people pick on Florida so much is that they’re jealous. White sand beaches, azure skies, and sun more days than not give haters plenty of reasons to hate, especially if they’re under six feet of snow.</p>\n<p>However, Floridians know that living in the Sunshine State doesn’t mean every day is sunny. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), <a href=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/\">40 percent</a> of all US hurricanes hit Florida shores.The state also leads the nation in the number of hurricanes making landfall: 120. All of that would be bad enough, but Florida is also the <a href=\"https://www.weather-us.com/en/florida-usa-climate#climate\"> lightning capital of the US</a>. And most Floridians know that where there’s lightning, there’s bound to be hail.</p>\n<p>So, yeah – Florida is beautiful, but it’s not for the faint of heart. Sooner or later, Florida happens to each and every one of its residents. And when it does, they need an insurance company that goes beyond the stereotype to see their side of the story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gethomeinsurancethatgetsyou\">Get home insurance that gets you</h2>\n<p>In the film, Florida Man asks, “Why does this stuff always happen to me?”</p>\n<p>Paradise isn’t out to get you, Florida Man. Some days it just feels like it is. And for those times when lightning sets your home ablaze or hail crashes through your roof – or even when a hurricane blows it all away – you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> that’s got your back.</p>\n<p>That’s where we come in. While more insurance companies <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/05/12/613541.htm\">cut and run after every storm</a>, Kin looks at every Florida homeowner as a family – another reason we’re not going to let anyone make fun of you! – so we’re not going anywhere. Instead, we built an insurance company that can handle the risks that come with living in the Sunshine State by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizing your coverage.</strong> Using <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data</a> helps us better understand what types of risks your home actually faces. That way, we can tailor your coverage accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing 5-star customer care.</strong> We treat policyholders like family – only the best for our kin. That’s why we have <a href=\"/reviews/\">thousands of 5-star reviews</a> on Trustpilot and a Net Promoter Score of 85 – more than double the industry average of 42.</li>\n<li><strong>Saving you money.</strong> By selling directly to you and cutting out middlemen, we keep our costs low and pass the savings on to you. Our <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey-2021/\">most recent survey</a> shows Kin customers save $600 on average.</li>\n<li><strong>Making claims easier.</strong> We use aerial imagery, satellite services, and virtual inspections so you can rebuild after a disaster faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we’re trying to say is that Kin is more than just another tech company. We deal in insurance, and our goal is to help people protect their homes and loved ones. When Hurricane Ian hit the Florida coast, our <a href=\"/blog/kinfolk-helping-kinfolk-after-hurricane-ian/\">Kinfolk stepped up to help their customers</a>, communities, and each other. That’s our vision for Kin.</p>\n<p>When it’s time to buy homeowners insurance, go with a company that understands <em>you</em>. Kin knows it’s not Florida Man; it’s just Florida, man.</p>"

    body: "<p>Wind resistance begins with your home's roof. Here are the components that you should be familiar with if you want your home to qualify for wind mitigation credits that can significantly reduce Florida home insurance premiums.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windmitigationandyourroof\">Wind Mitigation and Your Roof</h2>\n<p>Your roof is more than the top of your home. It ensures your home can withstand strong winds and impact. That's why it is the primary consideration during a <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">windstorm mitigation inspection</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the elements of the roof that play a key role in <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofcovering\">Roof Covering</h3>\n<p>The roof covering is what you see on the outside: asphalt shingles, concrete or clay tiles, metal, built-up or membrane. The strongest roof coverings are concrete or clay tiles and metal. You can save a pretty penny on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> policy if you can demonstrate on the wind mitigation form that your roof has one of those materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofdeck\">Roof Deck</h3>\n<p>The roof covering is installed over the roof deck. The roof deck is the roofing material between the structural components, the trusses and joists, and the insulation/weatherproofing layers of the home. The joists are used in the floor as column support and the trusses for the roof. Just picture the skeleton frame of the house, and that’s essentially the joists and trusses.</p>\n<p>A roof deck is generally made up of steel, concrete, cement or wood. Steel and concrete are the superior materials. When purchasing or building a new home, it’s wise to find out what material the roof deck is made of and how that will affect the overall cost of your homeowners insurance. Insurers tend to look most favorably on masonry homes with concrete slab foundations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofdeckattachment\">Roof Deck Attachment</h3>\n<p>The roof deck attachment connects the roof deck to the trusses or rafters by various types of plywood and nails. This determines how securely the roof is attached. Ideally, a solid roof deck prevents the roof from blowing off in <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane winds</a>.</p>\n<p>The greater thickness the plywood sheathing, the larger the nails, and the closer together the nails are, the lower the risk of a roof blowing off. Longer nails spaced closely together give the roof the greatest ability to withstand high winds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rooftowallattachments\">Roof-to-Wall Attachments</h3>\n<p>Having the strongest roof-to-wall attachments tends to provide some of the greatest windstorm mitigation credits with your insurance provider. Roof-to-wall attachments measure how securely your roof is attached to the wall and considers which mechanism you are using to provide that support.</p>\n<p>Toenails are the least secure attachment – this is basically a metal plate nailed to the trusses or rafters. The greatest support is double wraps, which involve metal support structures on both sides of a roof's frame.</p>"

    body: "<p>It's a seller's market right now, so if you're shopping for a home, you have to be ready to act fast. The process of buying a house has many moving pieces –&nbsp;and missing any of them could derail your purchase.</p>\n<p>So here's a guide to help you keep all your ducks in a row. Take a look at our home buying process checklist to make sure you’re on track to get your dream home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1determineifyourereadytobuyahome\">1. Determine if you’re ready to buy a home</h2>\n<p>See if buying a house is really the right move. Go over your finances and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are my job and income secure?</strong> You may be rolling in the dough right now, but you need to be at least fairly confident that you can maintain that level of income so you can pay your mortgage and other bills.</li>\n<li><strong>How is my credit?</strong> Check your credit report for items that you need to dispute and get fixed. A good credit score typically gives you more options with lenders.</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have debt to pay down?</strong> Mortgage lenders calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which is all of your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income, to see if it meets their requirements. The less debt you have, the better off you’ll be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, assess your liquid assets.You need to make a down payment, which may mean using your savings, selling assets, and maybe even accessing some of your retirement plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2calculatehowmuchhouseyoucanafford\">2. Calculate how much house you can afford</h2>\n<p>How much house you can afford is really determined by how much you can pay toward your mortgage every month. This isn’t an arbitrary number. In fact, it’s your DTI. Depending on the lender and <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">the type of mortgage</a> you qualify for, you want a maximum of DTI of 43 percent. That’s why paying debt down is so important.</p>\n<p>Lenders call this the back-end ratio. While it includes your mortgage and other housing expenses, it also looks at other debts like credit card bills, car payments, or child support. For the portion that’s dedicated to housing, called the front-end ratio, lenders prefer a DTI below 28 percent. That’s $280 for every $1,000 you make.</p>\n<p>The ultimate decision of <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">how much house you can afford</a> depends on your lender, but you can get a sense by running the numbers on your own or using an online mortgage calculator. Plugging your information into a mortgage calculator gives you an estimate of what you’ll pay per month based on current interest rates and the total cost of the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3savemoneyforyourdownpaymentandclosingcosts\">3. Save money for your down payment and closing costs</h2>\n<p>The price of the home you want is just the start of expenses in the process of buying a home. You also need money for closing costs, including a down payment on the home. There are a few loan programs out there that require <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">zero down payment</a>, but most require at least a three percent down payment. Many conventional lenders expect 20 percent down.</p>\n<p>The down payment is only one closing cost. At closing, you may also have to pay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appraisal fees.</li>\n<li>Loan origination fees.</li>\n<li>Title insurance.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closing costs can run between two and five percent of the total purchase price of the home. While you can roll some of these costs into the loan itself, you need to plan for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getpreapprovedforamortgage\">4. Get pre-approved for a mortgage</h2>\n<p>While there’s nothing to stop you from shopping for a home without pre-approval, you may be setting yourself up for heartache. More than one buyer has been disappointed when they learned they couldn’t get a loan for a house they fell in love with. Your better option is to get a lender to look at your financial situation, underwrite the loan, and send you a pre-approval letter so you know exactly how much money you have to work with.</p>\n<p>The pre-approval letter will list the amount you qualify for at a predetermined interest rate. However, it’s only good for a certain period and subject to change based on income changes, interest rate changes, and debt considerations. If your personal situation takes a dramatic turn, you could lose your pre-approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5choosetherightrealtorforyou\">5. Choose the right realtor for you</h2>\n<p>The realtor’s job is to balance your biggest wants with your actual needs. Few people can afford a home that checks every box, but a good realtor helps you prioritize what your home must have and find you something within your budget.</p>\n<p>You want a realtor who specializes in the buyer’s side of the transaction, as opposed to someone who works both sides of the deal. This ensures your realtor has your best interests at heart and that they can assist you through every step of the purchase and escrow. Remember, when you finally find a house and open escrow, the realtor must help you meet deadlines to avoid costly mistakes. Bottom line? Hire a pro.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6gohousehunting\">6. Go house hunting</h2>\n<p>You’ve reviewed your finances, gotten pre-approved for a mortgage, and contacted a realtor. Now it’s time for the fun stuff: house hunting! Your realtor will likely take you on a tour of available houses. Not only does this help them understand your likes and dislikes, it also gives you a clearer picture of what matters most to you.</p>\n<p>Attending open houses and searching online housing sites such as Zillow or Redfin help with this, too. Just remember to focus on homes that fit your budget and meet your highest priorities so you know how one affects the other. For example, say you want five bedrooms so you and your three children can each have their own rooms while still having space for guests. Your search may reveal that’s unrealistic for your budget.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">22 Questions to Ask When Buying a House</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"7makeanoffer\">7. Make an offer</h2>\n<p>This is the point in the process of buying a house where your realtor can really shine because they understand the market and how to negotiate for the best price. For slow markets, you might be able to make an offer at the asking price or even less. When there aren’t a lot of buyers for a property, you have more control. On the flip side, you might need to offer more than the asking price to compete with other offers if the housing market is hot.</p>\n<p>Whatever your offer is, you have to submit it to the seller in an offer letter. Key components of your offer letter are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name and current address.</li>\n<li>The price you’re willing to pay for the house.</li>\n<li>A deadline for the seller to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offer letters usually include earnest money to show your serious about buying the house. Your realtor can help you decide how much earnest money to put down, but one to two percent of the purchase price is typical.</p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to decide what your max offer is so you know when to walk away from a property. Because negotiations may not go your way, hold off on planning any renovations until you are certain you have the house at the close of escrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getahomeinspection\">8. Get a home inspection</h2>\n<p>Once your offer is accepted, you have the right to schedule an <a href=\"/blog/when-to-walk-away-after-a-home-inspection/\">inspection of the house</a>. You want to do this as soon as possible because you usually have limited number days based on the escrow contract.</p>\n<p>The inspector will evaluate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the home systems.</li>\n<li>The home’s structural components.</li>\n<li>Appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the inspector has assessed the home, they will give you a report with the findings. The report will include current problems, but the inspector might also list situations that could cause costly problems for you in the future. For major issues, like problems with the plumbing or foundation, people often get a secondary inspection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9askforrepairsandcredits\">9. Ask for repairs and credits</h2>\n<p>If the inspection reveals any major issues, you can ask the seller for repairs or credits. When you request repairs, you’re asking the homeowner to fix something before the sale is complete. For example, if the inspector found a leak in the bathroom tub, you can ask the seller to hire a plumber to fix it.</p>\n<p>Asking for credits means you want the seller to reduce the purchase price so you can afford to fix the problem on your own. For example, the owner may not be able to repair the roof during escrow, so they give you a $1,000 credit so you can fix it after the purchase is complete. The credit reduces the cost of the house.</p>\n<p>The seller may not accept your request, which means you’ll have to decide how to proceed. You should be able to walk away from the sale if you have an inspection contingency in your offer letter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10getanappraisal\">10. Get an appraisal</h2>\n<p>If you have a loan, you’ll definitely need to have the property appraised. An appraisal tells you the current market value of the home. If it shows a value that’s less than the loan, the lender could deny you or ask you to come up with additional cash to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>This also means you may need to renegotiate the price with the seller. You have the right to walk away from the property if the appraisal is not satisfactory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11haveafinalwalkthrough\">11. Have a final walkthrough</h2>\n<p>Once all inspections and the appraisal are complete, you’re near the end of escrow and the home is almost yours. This is the time to schedule a final walkthrough of the property to make sure that the owner has left it in the expected sale condition. Go through the house room by room to see if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s clean.</li>\n<li>Repairs have been made.</li>\n<li>The seller has cleared out the property.</li>\n<li>There are no new issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If something isn’t right, be sure to have your realtor bring it to the seller’s attention immediately. Don’t close escrow until every detail has been addressed. For example, don’t assume that the seller will be out of the house on the day you get the keys if their furniture is still in the house at the final walkthrough. You want a clean canvas to look at during the final walkthrough so you don’t have any surprises once you take ownership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12closeescrowandgetthekeys\">12. Close escrow and get the keys</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! The day has finally come, and you’re a homeowner! All you have to do is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign the final paperwork.</li>\n<li>Pay the closing costs if needed.</li>\n<li>Get the keys to your new home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This definitely sounds like the simplest step in the process of buying a home, but give yourself at least an hour to sign all the paperwork. There is a lot of it, and you don’t want to feel rushed when making the biggest purchase of your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13setyourmoveindate\">13. Set your move-in date</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the keys, you can move in at any time. But you may want to get some home repairs or renovations done while your home is empty. Painting or redoing a bathroom is easier before all your stuff is in the house. Once you have things in order, you can move in!</p>"

We take a closer look at the pros and cons of an HOA to help you make the right choice for you and your family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomeownersassociation\">What Is a Homeowners Association?</h2>\n<p>A homeowners association is an organization that works to protect property values of its members. It does this by enforcing rules and bylaws and collecting <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-fees/\">HOA fees</a> that it then uses to pay for the community’s upkeep and amenities. For instance, an HOA might pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Garbage pickup.</li>\n<li>Lawn care.</li>\n<li>Swimming pool maintenance.</li>\n<li>Professional security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HOAs are often run by volunteer homeowners from the community. However, you may find some hire professionals for specific positions, such as financial managers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofanhoa\">The Benefits of an HOA</h2>\n<p>There are definitely some pluses to buying a home or condo where there’s an HOA. For example, you might find your HOA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offers fun amenities.</strong> Communities with HOAs often come with some very nice extras that homeowners may not be able to afford on their own, like pools and recreation centers. Some may offer party areas that you can reserve for family gatherings, barbecues, and parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Takes care of maintenance and repairs.</strong> Your HOA fees typically go to community upkeep for common areas, which can mean routine maintenance, like landscaping, or sudden repairs, like replacing the shingles to a clubhouse after a storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Covers the community’s utilities and city services. Depending on your situation, your HOA fees may also go towards some of the community’s utility bills, including gas, electricity, and water. City services, like snow removal, can also be covered.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Protects your property’s value.</strong> Most HOAs have rules that encourage homeowners to keep their property looking nice, like requiring homeowners to keep their lawns mowed and their homes in good repair. These rules generally help keep property values up because they make the area attractive to potential buyers.</li>\n<li><strong>Helps with conflicts.</strong> Sometimes the rules are enough to minimize conflict in the community. But when they aren’t, HOAs usually have a system for mediating disputes between neighbors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your HOA usually takes care of insuring all the common areas. However, you still need <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> or <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> for your home or unit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consofanhoa\">Cons of an HOA</h2>\n<p>For some, the benefits of an HOA are outweighed by the drawbacks. The cons of living with an HOA include the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost.</strong> Being part of an HOA does add to your monthly bills. Some HOA fees are minimal, maybe costing you an extra $50 per month, but others might cost several hundred dollars.</li>\n<li><strong>Rules.</strong> Joining an HOA means you agree to follow the rules, which can range anywhere from the color you can paint your front door to the number of people who can live in your house. You might find these rules frustrating, but ignoring them may result in fines.</li>\n<li><strong>Politics.</strong> Your HOA is likely run by neighbors who’ve been elected to its board of directors. While that can mean the people in charge have a good handle on what the community needs, it can also cause problems when the board has to weigh what’s best for the neighborhood against an individual’s preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"questiontoaskbeforejoininganhoa\">Question to Ask Before Joining an HOA</h2>\n<p>Before you buy in a community with an HOA, you want to make sure that you understand what you’re getting into. You need to know how much you’ll pay in HOA fees and what sort of services and amenities you get for that extra cost. Plus, you want to get an idea of whether or not the community is a good fit. Some key questions to ask include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I have a copy of the HOA’s bylaws?</li>\n<li>How much are the HOA fees and what do they cover?</li>\n<li>When was the last time the board increased the HOA fee?</li>\n<li>How often are there special assessments?</li>\n<li>What was the most recent special assessment for?</li>\n<li>Is the board planning any major projects in the near future?</li>\n<li>How much does the HOA hold in reserve?</li>\n<li>What isn’t covered under the HOA’s insurance policy?</li>\n<li>Do the amenities fit my lifestyle? Will I get my money’s worth?</li>\n<li>Is the property a good investment?</li>\n<li>Do the rules restrict the type or number of pets I can have?</li>\n<li>Can I rent the property to others?</li>\n<li>Is this an age restricted community?</li>\n<li>What are the rules regarding solar panels, satellite dishes, flags, fences, and patios?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not a complete list of all the <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">questions to ask when buying a house</a>, but it should give you a good idea of issues you need to cover before you join an HOA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canyourefusetojoinahomeownersassociation\">Can You Refuse to Join a Homeowners Association?</h2>\n<p>HOAs are almost always mandatory. Otherwise, they’d have no way to enforce their rules and regulations. So the only way to avoid joining an HOA is to buy a home where there isn’t one.</p>"

    body: "<p>Whether you call it a tornado or a hurricane, a windstorm can cause extensive damage to your home. So why does the average homeowner near Hurricane Alley pay more for their home insurance than those living in Tornado Alley?</p>\n<p>For insurance providers, the risks are actually quite different. Let’s take a look at tornadoes and hurricanes so we can better understand the costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatistornadoalley\">What is Tornado Alley</h2>\n<p>Tornado Alley is a tornado-prone stretch of land between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. While there is no set border (and they area generally recognized as <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">Tornado Alley may be shifting</a>), the term usually includes parts of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kin.com/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a></li>\n<li>Oklahoma</li>\n<li>Kansas</li>\n<li>Nebraska</li>\n<li>South Dakota</li>\n<li>Iowa</li>\n<li>Missouri</li>\n<li>Illinois</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatishurricanealley\">What is Hurricane Alley</h2>\n<p>Hurricane Alley is an area in the Atlantic Ocean where warm surface temperatures create the opportunity for hurricanes. From June 1 to November 30, the states along the US eastern coast and the Gulf of Mexico face a high risk for hurricanes. In fact, NOAA’s <a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E19.html\">Hurricane Research Division reports</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>40 percent of all US hurricanes hit Florida.</li>\n<li>88 percent of major hurricanes hit either Florida or Texas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tornadoesvshurricaneswhatsthedifference\">Tornadoes vs. Hurricanes: What’s the difference?</h2>\n<p>Whether you live in Tornado Alley or Hurricane Alley, your home faces potentially damaging windstorms. But that doesn’t mean hurricanes and tornadoes are the same – or that they do the same kind of harm.</p>\n<p>For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tells us that the US sees about <a href=\"https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/\">1,200 tornadoes per year</a>. That sounds like a lot – and it is – but tornadoes are spread out over several states.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, tornadoes are unpredictable. The average lead time for a tornado warning is just <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/quickfacts_Tornadoes.pdf\">11 minutes</a>. However, they’re also relatively short windstorms. The most severe may last an hour, but the most common tornadoes are over in about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>The most severe tornadoes can have wind speeds of up to 300 mph. However, NOAA says 69 percent of all tornadoes fall between 65 and 110 mph. For comparison, a major hurricane, category 3 or above, reaches wind speeds between 111 and 129 mph.</p>\n<p>Hurricanes are also more predictable. Scientists can usually predict a hurricane’s path between <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2010/teams/neworleans1/predicting%20hurricanes.htm\">3 to 5 days in advance</a>. Moreover, the average hurricane season only sees about 10 named storms, but those storms usually cause more damage than tornadoes. That’s because the wind and rain from a hurricane can last up to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Hurricanes win when it comes to size, too. NOAA says the widest damage path for a tornado was 2.5 miles. The largest hurricane by diameter was Olga in 2004. That storm was 995 miles wide. Hurricanes also cause storm surge, which means homeowners in hurricane alley have to worry about both wind and <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tornadoesvshurricanesasidebysidecomparison\">Tornadoes vs. Hurricanes: a side-by-side comparison</h3>\n<p>|  | Tornadoes | Hurricanes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lead time | ~11 min | 3 - 5 days |\n| Average Number | 1,200 per year | 10 per season |\n| Wind speed | Up to 300 mph | Up to 157 mph or more |\n| Duration | Up to an 60 min | Up to 3 weeks |</p>\n<p>These numbers show just how important it is to have <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> and Texas. But how do the differences between hurricanes and tornadoes impact the cost of your <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyhomeinsurancemaycostmoreinhurricanealley\">Why home insurance may cost more in Hurricane Alley</h2>\n<p>Insurers look at a number of <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/11-factors-impacting-home-insurance-premium/\">factors to determine home insurance premiums</a>. One of the biggest is the weather. Homeowners in hurricane alley face greater risk of catastrophic weather events because of how long and how strong hurricanes can be. As a result, these homeowners typically pay higher premiums.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just the premiums that make their home insurance more expensive. In Hurricane Alley, homeowners may also have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay a percentage deductible</strong>. Nineteen states and Washington DC require homeowners on the coast to pay a <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> for their <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane home insurance</a>. Instead of paying a flat dollar amount, they pay a percentage of their home’s value. This helps insurance companies pay for the enormous claims that come in after a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy flood insurance</strong>. Standard homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flood. Considering <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Flood_Loss_Estimations_2017.pdf\">FEMA estimates</a> that just an inch of water can cause more than $26,000 of damage in the average home, purchasing flood insurance is usually recommended.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having high hurricane risk makes insurance a no-brainer. However, you can also help mitigate losses by planning ahead. Find out how in “<a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">6 Ways to Hurricane-Proof Your Home</a>.”</p>"

    body: "<p>Credit cards are hard to pay off, and if you’re like most of the US population, you probably have some credit debt to your name.</p>\n<p>In fact, the typical American has four credit cards and an average credit card balance of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/12/credit-card-debt-average-balance-hits-6-200-and-limit-31-000/4722897002/\">nearly $6,200</a>. That’s about 20 percent more credit card debt than a decade ago. Paying off credit card debt is one of the most difficult things to do because the <a href=\"https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/average-apr\">average interest rates</a> range from 15.58 percent to 22.83 percent.</p>\n<p>So say you have a credit card balance of $10,000 and a 20 percent APR. You’d pay about $2,215 in interest every year you hold that debt.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at some strategies to pay off that balance and avoid those pesky interest rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopayoffcreditcarddebt\">How to Pay Off Credit Card Debt</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been following our budgeting tips, you already know that a standard budget sets aside 20 percent of your income to pay off debts or save money. If you have credit card debt, it’s smart to prioritize paying down these balances so you don’t keep losing money in interest charges.</p>\n<p>Here are five ways you can do just that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1trythedebtsnowballmethod\">1. Try the Debt Snowball Method</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouneedalittlemomentum\">Best If: You Need a Little Momentum</h3>\n<p>The debt snowball method is a budgeting and debt repayment method where you pay off the smallest debts first. The idea is that you gain momentum and feel good about getting something to a zero balance before focusing on the next larger debt.</p>\n<p>In this method, you pay the minimum required payment on all credit cards except the one with the smallest balance. You pay down that one with both principal and interest payments.</p>\n<p>This method was made popular by Dave Ramsey, but <a href=\"https://www.debt.org/advice/debt-snowball-method-how-it-works/\">Debt.org</a> notes you may pay more in the long run if you use this budgeting method. That’s because you may be making minimum payments on cards that generate the most interest.</p>\n<p>Let’s do the math: if two cards have the same APR of 20 percent, the one with the bigger balance is costing you more in interest. Assume you are paying off the $1,000 balance versus the $10,000. The smaller card has $212.50 in yearly interest while the larger one is costing you $2,215 in interest every year.</p>\n<p>That said, this method is praised for its psychological advantage: it feels good to pay a balance off. That can help inspire folks to tackle the bigger debts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2usethedebtavalanchemethod\">2. Use the Debt Avalanche Method</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouhavehighinterestcreditcards\">Best If: You Have High-Interest Credit Cards</h3>\n<p>The concept is simple: pay off the most expensive debts first. The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp\">debt avalanche method</a> prioritizes paying off the credit card with the highest interest rate regardless of its balance. Once that card is paid off, you focus your efforts on the next debt with the highest interest.</p>\n<p>Unlike the debt snowball method that pays the smallest debt first, the debt avalanche makes minimum payments on all cards except the one with the highest interest rate. You’ll pay the interest plus principal on this card every month until it’s paid off.</p>\n<p>This is the right route for you if you have high interest rates that are eating up your minimum payments each month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3transferyourbalance\">3. Transfer Your Balance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyoucanpayoffthedebtduringthezerointerestpromotionalperiod\">Best If: You Can Pay Off the Debt During the Zero-Interest Promotional Period</h3>\n<p>One way to pay down credit card debt is to get the balances transferred to a new card with a lower interest rate. Many cards have an introductory zero interest rate, usually for a year, when you transfer your balance. This means every payment goes toward the principal balance until the APR kicks in.</p>\n<p>For this method to work, don’t use the original card anymore. If you have more than one card, continue to pay monthly minimum payments while you pay down the card with zero interest.</p>\n<p>Before you transfer a balance to a new credit card, check transfer fees and the APR once the promotional period ends. This option often only makes sense if you can pay off the balance during the promotional period.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have $10,000 in credit card debt that you are transferring over to a zero-interest promotional card, there may be a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/balance-transfer-3\">3 percent to 5 percent transfer fee</a>. This could add up to $500 to your total debt just by transferring the balance. Make sure you’re aware of all fees and costs before transferring your balance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4applyforahomeequitylineofcredit\">4. Apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouwanttoconsolidatehighinterestdebt\">Best If: You Want to Consolidate High-Interest Debt</h3>\n<p>One method to get rid of credit card debt is to transfer the balance to a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/home-equity-to-consolidate-debt\">home equity line of credit</a>. This method requires discipline: you don’t want to overspend when you have access to a large line of credit. The process is simple: use the checks provided by the credit line to pay off your existing credit card balances.</p>\n<p>Home equity lines of credit typically have interest rates much lower than credit cards, which decreases the cost of the debt. Another advantage is that they charge simple interest rather than compound interest. This reduces the amount of interest you pay over time.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these rates are usually variable and can go up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5exploreacashoutrefinance\">5. Explore a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouhaveenoughequitytocoverthedebt\">Best If: You Have Enough Equity to Cover the Debt</h3>\n<p>If you are planning to refinance your mortgage to take advantage of historically low interest rates, you may want to consider rolling your <a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/34032\">credit card debt into the refinance</a>. You’ll need to have enough equity in your home to account for the new debt, but this option helps you to stop paying 15 percent interest rates – and you even get a tax deduction on interest payments.</p>\n<p>Talk to your lender about consolidating your debt into your refinance. They’ll obtain copies of the credit card debt and run a detailed analysis of when your break-even point will be. When the loan funds, the lender will send a check to the credit card company to pay it off. While you are in escrow, you’ll want to continue to make minimum payments on the debt.</p>\n<p>One of the good things about consolidation is you only have one bill to pay monthly. But be sure to maintain discipline with the credit cards and not rack up a bunch of new debt when you see the balances at zero.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteonbudgetingfordebtpayments\">A Note on Budgeting for Debt Payments</h2>\n<p>No matter what method of paying down credit card debt you choose, <a href=\"/blog/best-budgeting-apps/\">you’ll need a budget</a> that allows you to make payments beyond the monthly minimum. Most budget systems work on the 50/20/30 budget model: 50 percent for needs, 30 percent for discretionary spending, and 20 percent for savings and debts.</p>\n<p>Factor this 20 percent into your budget to make sure you have enough money every month to pay toward the principal in addition to the interest. Start thinking about debt as a numbers game that you will win at.</p>\n<p>Write your debts down. Include the balance and the interest rate so you can clearly see what each credit card balance is costing you. From there, choose one of the methods above so you can pay the debt off and start living a debt-free life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforpayingoffcreditcardsinfull\">Tips for Paying Off Credit Cards in Full</h2>\n<p>Accumulating debt can happen in a matter of minutes, but paying it off often requires months, if not years, of discipline. Regardless of what method you choose to pay off your debt, use these tools as a starting point and remember to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stick to the plan.</strong> Consistently paying down your balance is the only way to pay off your debt in a timely way.</li>\n<li><strong>Freeze your credit cards while you pay them off.</strong> This prevents you from using them and adding to your balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Put windfalls to work.</strong> Got a big tax return? A stipend? Sold some collectibles on eBay? Put that unexpected cash toward your debt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that credit history – how long you’ve had your credit cards – is a positive indicator for credit scores. This means you might not want to cancel your cards altogether after you pay them off.</p>\n<p>Paying down debt will have a positive <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">impact on your credit score</a> – and in some states, that can lead to lower home insurance premiums.</p>"

    body: "<p>As a first-time home buyer, you’re probably paying closer attention to types of houses and styles of architecture than you ever have before. The dizzying array of possibilities, inevitably described by industry-specific lingo, can leave a novice scratching their head.</p>\n<p>No one expects you to be an expert, but understanding the terminology can help you better explain what you’re looking for to your real estate agent. That can save you time and energy while <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">buying your dream home</a>. Before you start talking about the style of the home, let’s first lock in on the types of houses you can purchase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofhousestructures\">Types of house structures</h2>\n<p>When your real estate agent asks what type of house you’re interested in, they’re most likely trying to figure out what you’re looking for in terms of the physical structure. Do you want a home designed for just one family residence or does a multi-family home appeal to you? Are you okay in a structure where other people are just on the other side of each wall or do you want a standalone home?</p>\n<p>Each type of house has unique features that appeal to different situations. Below is a list of six common structure types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"singlefamilydetachedhouse\">Single-family detached house</h3>\n<p>You probably already know single-family detached homes as standalone houses. These structures do not share a wall with any other residential or commercial space. Normally, a single-family detached home has space on all sides and a garage located somewhere on the property – either attached to the home or detached. A single-family home is designed to house one family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multifamilyhome\">Multi-family home</h3>\n<p>Multi-family homes are single buildings that can house more than one family so that each residence shares walls, ceilings, and floors. Duplexes, apartment buildings, and townhouses are good examples of multi-family. A multi-family home could even be a detached home with a secondary living space, such as a finished basement or loft above the garage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"townhouseorrowhouse\">Townhouse or row house</h3>\n<p>A townhouse or row house is a structure where neighbors again share walls. However, a townhouse usually has multiple floors, its own entrance to the street, and sits on land that belongs to the homeowner. They’re usually designed to be part of a community, so you’ll often find several townhomes lined up in a row or along a square. In many places, “townhouse” and “row house” are synonymous, but some only use row house to describe these attached structures when the outside of each residence looks the same as all the others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"condominium\">Condominium</h3>\n<p>As far as the structure is concerned, a condominium can resemble a single-family home, a townhouse, or an apartment complex. What sets this type of house apart is its ownership. Condo owners own the walls of their residence and the space between them, but they don’t own the land that it sits on or any common areas that may also be part of the complex. This is true even when the condo is built as a townhome, single-family detached, or multi-family structure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manufacturedmobilehome\">Manufactured / Mobile home</h3>\n<p>A manufactured home, also known as a <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home</a>, is a structure that’s built in a factory on a chassis so it can be moved to a plot of land. Like a single-family detached home, a mobile home is free standing, meaning it doesn’t share walls with other residences. However, mobile homes are not built on a foundation, and owners often have to rent the land they live on. Mobile homes are a cost-effective way for people to afford a house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commercialproperty\">Commercial property</h3>\n<p>Commercial property is real estate that’s used for business purposes, including office buildings, warehouses, and large residential rental properties. There are some instances where a commercial building is zoned as a multi-use building, meaning it has both commercial spaces and residential spaces. The residential spaces are usually located above the commercial space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofhousestyles\">Types of house styles</h2>\n<p>On top of asking about the structure of your dream home, your real estate agent will also want to know what type of house styles appeal to you. Style is the architectural design of the home and may be local to your community or state. For example, Massachusetts is known for Cape Cods while California is known for Spanish-style homes.</p>\n<p>The type of house styles that are popular in your state depends on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Sub-tropical Florida is an excellent example of how climate can impact house styles. Ranch-style homes are popular in the Sunshine State in part because hot air rises making it expensive to air condition a second floor.</li>\n<li><strong>Available building materials:</strong> Some building materials are less available in certain regions, so homes are less likely to be made of them. “In the Pacific Northwest, brick is uncommon because the material for making brick is not found there,” according to John A. Kilpatrick of <a href=\"http://www.greenfieldadvisors.com\">Greenfield Advisors</a>. “However, the clay for brick is common in the southeast, where hardwood and cedar are not common. Hence, in Washington and Oregon you see lots of cedar homes, and in the southeast you see a lot of brick ranch style homes.”</li>\n<li><strong>Local history:</strong> As Europeans burned a path across North America, some set up shop in different parts of the continent. Thomas Jepsen of <a href=\"https://passionplans.com\">Passion Plans</a>, for example, says: “In Florida, where a lot of settlers were Spanish, the Mediterranean and Victorian looks are more prevalent.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just as a heads up, there’s going to be a lot of talk about roofs in the upcoming sections. You might want to check out “<a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">What’s In a Roof</a>” before reading about the various types of house styles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cottage\">Cottage</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cottage-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Cottage style homes are often on the small side﹘typically one story﹘but thought of as cozy and charming. Common features of a cottage include shingled or stucco walls, small porches, bay windows, and a gable roof. Though small, cottage-style homes are well designed and known to have an efficient footprint. They can be found anywhere, but are most popular in the northeastern United States.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mediterranean\">Mediterranean</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mediterranean-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Mediterranean homes are popular in California and Florida because of the influence of Spanish colonizers in these regions. These homes typically have a courtyard that incorporates indoor and outdoor living and maximizes air circulation throughout the house﹘perfect for warmer climates. Other notable features include white stucco walls mixed with warm wood and stone accents, tiled roofs, and arched doorways and windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ranch\">Ranch</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/ranch-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a spacious, one-story home, the ranch style may be suitable for you. Ranch-style homes usually have open floor plans, low-pitched roofs, and attached garages, but the style has been modified to meet the demands in certain locations. For example, California ranch homes are often L- or U-shaped with sliding glass doors to encourage indoor/outdoor living. Raised ranches, on the other hand, sit up on a foundation and are often found in areas where clay in the soil causes drainage problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"colonial\">Colonial</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/colonial-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The general structure of colonial style homes is simple and symmetrical. These two- or three-story rectangles boast ample space with grand entryways, central staircases, and wood shingles on a shallow gable roof. There are several variations, often depending on where a colonial home is found. We’ve listed a few examples below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dutch Colonial.</strong> You can usually identify a Dutch Colonial by it’s gambrel roof. Also called a barn roof, these double-pitched roofs start out with a relatively wide, flat slope that then takes a sharp downward turn. Dutch Colonials are often found in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</li>\n<li><strong>French Colonial.</strong> Popular in many parts of Louisiana, French Colonial homes have either steep hipped roofs or side-gabled roofs. Other prevalent features include large wraparound porches with columns, French doors, and shuttered windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Spanish Colonial.</strong> Spanish Colonials, typically found in Florida and the Southwest, are designed for hot weather. Their thick stucco walls capture heat that then warms the house as temperatures cool in the evening. The windows of a Spanish Colonial house are small, but usually only covered with wrought iron to allow breezes in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"frenchcountry\">French country</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/french-country-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The French country home typically has a natural stone facade;, tall, multi-paned windows; and either a hip- or mansard-style roof. Another notable feature is the roofing material: clay, barrel-shaped, overlapping tiles. The interior often has two stone fireplaces, one for each side of the house, and distressed wood accents throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"midcenturymodern\">Mid-century modern</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mid-century-modern-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The end of World War II generated a new, forward-looking style for people looking to integrate with nature. Mid-century modern homes are sleek with flat roofs and angular features. Most also offer multiple ceiling-to-floor windows to encourage interaction with the outdoors, plus a mix of natural (often organic) and man-made materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tudor\">Tudor</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tudor-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Tudor homes became popular throughout the US in the 1920s and are probably most recognizable by their first floor brick exteriors combined with a second floor made of stucco with decorative timber. These homes usually have steep gable roofs, asymmetrical floor plans, and tall leaded windows with multiple panes set in a diamond pattern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"victorian\">Victorian</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/victorian-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Introduced to the U.S. in the late 1830s, Victorian homes are often two to three stories and very ornate, with plenty of decorative trim, vivid colors, and an asymmetrical shape that creates several rooflines. Some even have rounded rooms resembling a castle tower. Other standout features include wraparound porches and large bay windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craftsman\">Craftsman</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/craftsman-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A craftsman home highlights its maker’s skills through large overhangs, exposed rafters and beams on the exterior, and sash windows. These small and medium-sized homes usually have a low-pitched gable roof, open front porch with tapered columns, and large picture window. While the original craftsman homes had closed off interiors to distinguish one room from another, modern versions can have open floor plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contemporary\">Contemporary</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/contemporary-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Contemporary homes incorporate elements of the modern style with a green twist. They use eco-friendly materials in a sleek design that uses glass to make spaces seem bigger than they are. Lines are strong and roofs flat, evoking a minimalist feel. And while many harken back to the angular features found in mid-century modern homes, some use free-form lines that echo shapes found in nature and create a feeling of movement.</p>\n<p>Contemporary styles can certainly adapt to their communities. Realtor Shelton Wilder of <a href=\"https://sheltonwilder.com/\">The Shelton Wilder Group</a> says that Los Angeles sees “a lot of new construction and remodels embracing the year-round warm weather with an emphasis on indoor/outdoor living.” That might translate to large walls with floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading to a patio or side yard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"capecod\">Cape Cod</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cape-cod-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Cape Cod homes have a longstanding history in the US featured throughout New England communities. The standout feature of these symmetrical dwellings is the centralized chimney, but they’re also known for their steep roofs and gabled dormers. Traditional Cape Cods have shingle wood siding, but newer versions may be made of brick or stucco.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebesttypeofhousetobuy\">The best type of house to buy</h2>\n<p>Choosing the best style house for you depends on a lot of factors. Cost, of course, is a major one. Some types of house styles are mostly found in places where real estate is expensive, so that drives up the average cost. Similarly, you may end up paying more if a particular style is rare in your area.</p>\n<p>But you also want to think about what type of house fits your needs and preferences. You certainly don’t want to get a townhouse if you hate climbing stairs or want a little space between you and your neighbors. However, if you’re hoping to earn rental income to pay off your mortgage, then a multi-family home is a good choice.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should love how the house looks. Let’s say you find a colonial home that has the space you need, but you can’t stand its boxy shape ﹘ walk away! You’re spending too much money to live in a home you hate.</p>\n<p>Tell your realtor the types of house styles that you’re most attracted to and have them search the market for homes that fit the bill. Chances are that you’ll find a wide range of prices, but with the right amount of patience and persistence, you’ll find the perfect place to call home.</p>"

    body: "<p>Gardeners know that if you want to lush plants and vibrant flowers in the summer, you’ve got to get organized in the spring. Take a look at our spring gardening checklist for simple tasks to get you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1cleanupdebris\">1. Clean Up Debris</h2>\n<p>The first step is to remove dead leaves and branches that may have accumulated in your garden during the winter months. You also want to toss out any mulch you used on your perennials. While all this debris protected your plants from the cold, it now needs to be cleared out so the sun can do its magic. Much of what you clean up can go on your compost pile if you’re into <a href=\"/blog/sustainable-gardening-ideas/\">sustainable gardening</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2removewinterprotection\">2. Remove Winter Protection</h2>\n<p>Now is the time to take off any winter protection, such as burlap barriers or wraps. The plants no longer need the defense and will be hindered by the protection as they try to bloom in the spring and summer. You can also remove any staking on trees that have been in the ground for more than a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3weedflowerbeds\">3. Weed Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>You may have some leftover weeds from the previous season, and new ones probably sprouted as the weather warmed. The best time to pull weeds is early spring, when the ground is softer than summer's hard, dry soil, but the best tip is to get to them before they grow. Otherwise, you may have a tough time getting the entire root.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4inspectyourtrees\">4. Inspect Your Trees</h2>\n<p>Winter can be hard on trees, so take a close look at yours and remove dead wood and storm-damaged branches. Not only does this make your trees more attractive, but it’s also a good move for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> because it reduces the chance for branches to cause damage in a windstorm.</p>\n<p>You also want to examine the tips for discoloration. This could be dieback, a condition where trees die from the tip of their leaves backwards. When you see it, snip the tips off to encourage new growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5pruneyourshrubs\">5. Prune Your Shrubs</h2>\n<p>Shrubs that bloom in the late summer and early fall typically need to be pruned in the spring. Pruning simply means removing part of a plant to encourage and manage growth. Common parts to prune include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dead, dying, and diseased branches.</li>\n<li>Awkwardly growing branches, such as branches that grow down rather than up.</li>\n<li>Shoots growing from the trunk of a tree or the base of a shrub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good pruning is key to healthy, beautiful plants, but remember the rule here is “less is more.” Be careful not to snip new buds that may flower. Another good rule? Wait until you see flowers on spring-blooming plants before you prune them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6fertilizeyourflowerbeds\">6. Fertilize Your Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>Once you’re certain that you won’t see frost and cold weather again, you can apply fertilizer to get your soil in the best possible condition for new plants. Natural, organic fertilizers are usually the best way to go because <a href=\"https://www.milorganite.com/lawn-care/organic-lawn-care/organic-vs-synthetic\">synthetics may harm your soil</a> over time. Beyond that, you need to choose a fertilizer that suits your plants and soil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7divideyourperennials\">7. Divide Your Perennials</h2>\n<p>As perennials return, you want to give their roots more space to get the nutrients they need. You can do this by dividing them into multiple plants before new growth begins. Replant the perennials you split off and water liberally to help them re-root in their new home. However, you only want to do this with perennials that bloom later in the seasons. If you already see buds or flowers, It’s best to wait until the fall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8edgeyourflowerbeds\">8. Edge Your Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>Edging is when you create a border between your flower beds and other areas, most commonly your lawn. Doing this makes your garden look neat and tidy, but it also helps to create a lip that holds mulch in place and may even keep weeds at bay.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps if you’ve never edged a flower bed before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline where you want your border with a string, garden hose, or spray paint.</li>\n<li>Cut along that border with a sharp edging tool, like a spade.</li>\n<li>Remove the turf.</li>\n<li>Add mulch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add brick pavers or metal edging to further define your flower bed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9preventweeds\">9. Prevent Weeds</h2>\n<p>While you can fight weeds with an herbicide, you may want to try some options that don’t require chemicals. For example, weeds take advantage of open spaces, so you can minimize their growth by placing your flowers close together. A thick layer of mulch can also smother out small weeds. Finally, avoid unnecessary tilling and cultivating once your garden gets going. Turning over your soil moves weed seeds to the surface and encourages their growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10hardenyourplantsfortheoutdoors\">10. Harden Your Plants for the Outdoors</h2>\n<p>If you started growing your plants inside, you need to gradually prepare them for being outside. The process is called hardening, and it protects seedlings by <a href=\"https://plantvillage.psu.edu/posts/3406-general-best-method-for-hardening-off-plants-in-spring\">thickening the cuticle on their leaves</a>.</p>\n<p>You can usually start hardening by placing your plants outdoors once the temperature hits 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave them in a place that’s protected from the wind and direct sunlight for about an hour. Gradually increase their time outdoors by about an hour every day, then move them to direct sunlight after two or three days. By the end of the second week, your plants will most likely be ready to transplant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11makeoveryouroutdoorspace\">11. Make Over Your Outdoor Space</h2>\n<p>With all the hard work you’ve put into your spring gardening, you’ll want to have a chance to enjoy it. Maybe that means investing in new patio furniture, adding a privacy fence, or decorating with wind chimes or gazing balls ﹘the choice is totally up to you. After all, you’ve earned the opportunity to put your feet up and enjoy your garden!</p>"

    body: "<p>Natural disasters are getting worse each year, and that leaves the most vulnerable areas and homeowners exposed to the most damage.</p>\n<p>Approximately 4 million homes in the United States are uninsured, and about <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millions-of-homes-under-insured/\">64 percent</a> of homes are underinsured - many not by choice. As the cost of coverage continues to climb, many people don’t have the financial accessibility to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>Consider the homes of the Florida Panhandle that have been passed over by major insurers for decades now. Or the poor economic conditions in rural areas that can make insurance out of reach. It can feel as if insurance is only for those who can afford it. The reality is the family that doesn’t have the cash on hand to rebuild needs insurance the most.</p>\n<p>So how do we make insurance more affordable for everyone?</p>\n<h2 id=\"disastershurttheuninsuredthemost\">Disasters Hurt the Uninsured the Most</h2>\n<p>The affordability of insurance is a big problem, and so is the cost of recent disasters. The data below shows just how devastating the financial strain of going without insurance can be.</p>\n<p>| Total Damages and Uninsured Damages for Recent Natural Disasters |\n| Natural Disaster | Total Damage | Uninsured Damage |\n| --- |\n| Hurricane Katrina | $125 billion | $45 billion |\n| Camp Fire | $16.5 billion | $4 billion |\n| 2019 Southern Tornadoes | $925 million | $225 million |\n| Hurricane Dorian | $5.2 billion | ~$2.6 billion |</p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/fourteen-years-later-new-orleans-is-still-trying-to-recover-from-hurricane-katrina\">15 years after Hurricane Katrina</a>, New Orleans and its surrounding communities are still trying to rebuild. Many residents without insurance abandoned their homes and moved away where they could get jobs and start over.</p>\n<p>A similar story plays out in the rural town of Paradise, California, that was overrun by the Camp Fire in 2018. Nearly 90 percent of the city’s structures were destroyed, and the <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/wildfires/2019/11/07/paradise-california-struggles-rebuild-safer-after-deadly-camp-fire/3787072002/\">population of 28,000 is now around 4,000</a>. Many of these homes were uninsured and unprepared for a disaster.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://news.wfsu.org/state-news/2019-10-08/a-year-after-hurricane-michael-recovery-is-moving-slowly-some-say-insurance-is-to-blame\">rural Florida Panhandle counties</a> have lower insured rates than the state average. It’s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/thousands-of-floridians-arent-insuring-their-homes/3549/\">12.8 percent of owner-occupied homes</a> don’t have homeowners insurance in Florida, whereas the national average of uninsured homes is about 5 percent.</p>\n<p>In places like Liberty County, the rate could be even higher because only 15 percent of homes have a mortgage that would require homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Some folks may think home insurance is optional when it’s not required, especially if they’re already budget constrained or in areas where the median income is below the national average, like in <a href=\"https://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/florida/panama-city/\">Panama City, Florida</a>. But the truth is that going without insurance only increases financial hardship.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehighcostofnothavinginsurance\">The High Cost of Not Having Insurance</h2>\n<p>We’ve seen from past disasters that those who don’t have the money to rebuild can’t afford to <em>not</em> have insurance.</p>\n<p>Let’s run some numbers. According to Home Advisor, it costs between <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/\">$100 to $200 per square foot</a> to build a typical home. If we take the median number of $150 per square foot for a 1,500 square foot house, it takes $225,000 to build a home.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t include the belongings inside or living expenses while the house was uninhabitable. When a family loses everything in a storm or fire, their loss could be valued well over $300,000 with moderate personal belongings and living expenses factored in. Those who don’t have the means to start over rely on federal aid, and it isn’t much.</p>\n<p>A federal aid program designed to help disaster victims only offers about <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/louisiana_flood_2016/article_22c86fe0-64cd-11e6-9bb2-07f95d36ee28.html\">$33,000 per household</a>. The reality is most people get a fraction of that, averaging $8,000 or less. That’s barely enough for a couple months of rent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingtechnologytomakeinsurancefinanciallyaccessible\">Using Technology to Make Insurance Financially Accessible</h2>\n<p>Across the nation, the cost of insurance continues to rise. Currently, homeowners insurance <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">averages $1,211</a> a year in the US. But states that get hit harder by natural disasters, such as Florida, pay more and more.</p>\n<p>On average, <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">Florida home insurance costs are the second highest in the country</a>, thanks to hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes. In some cases, Floridians are paying two to three times the national average, taking a serious bite out of a monthly budget.</p>\n<p>Insurance isn’t a luxury item, and it needs to be available to all homeowners, especially those most vulnerable to a total loss. We believe technology is the key to making insurance more affordable and accessible.</p>\n<p>For starters, you shouldn’t have to go into an agent’s office to get insurance, which is taxing for those working late hours to support their families. Getting home insurance should be as easy as going online or picking up the phone. We rely on technology to replace outside agents and help us eliminate the 32 percent in premium dollars otherwise spent on administrative costs and agency infrastructure.</p>\n<p>You also shouldn’t have to be an expert in your home’s construction to get an accurate quote. That’s why our super simple online application automatically pulls public data about your home to help us tailor your coverage.</p>\n<p>Rather than determining your home’s risk based on your entire community, we use <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data to accurately assess every home</a>. That means you only pay for what it costs to protect your home, not the entire ZIP code.</p>\n<p>The result? We’re able to <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey/\">save homeowners $500 a year on average</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s always more work to do, but we are inspired to be the force of change that makes insurance readily available for all homeowners – especially those who need it most.</p>"

This includes states like Texas, where an <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/17/texas-winter-storm-2021-stories/\">unexpected winter storm</a> caused <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prep-for-a-power-outage/\">power outages</a>, billions in property damage, and fatalities. CoreLogic reports that winter storms ultimately affected more than 12.7 million homes and caused more than $15 billion in property damage in 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d33billioninhurricanepropertydamage\">$33 Billion in Hurricane Property Damage</h2>\n<p>The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third most active ever. The region faced 21 named storms, of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 made landfall in the US.</li>\n<li>7 became hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 were major hurricanes (i.e., Category 3 or higher).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, 2021 was the seventh consecutive year that a named storm formed prior to the official start of the season on June 1. All of these storms led to $33 billion in property damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneidathecostliestusdisasterof2021\">Hurricane Ida: The Costliest U.S. Disaster of 2021</h2>\n<p>Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana in August 2021. As the storm moved northeast, it brought with it 149 miles per hour winds and up to 10 inches of rain in some areas. The storm’s ultimate price tag of <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/01/third-costliest-year-on-record-for-weather-disasters-in-2021-343-billion-in-damages/\">$75 billion</a> makes Hurricane Ida the most expensive natural disaster of 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overd7billionindamagefromsevereweather\">Over $7 Billion in Damage from Severe Weather</h2>\n<p>Severe weather may not sound like a natural disaster, but this category includes tornadoes and hailstorms that can do serious harm – which explains the $7 billion in property damage.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, we imagine twisters ripping through tornado alley, so it’s not a big surprise to see that Texas tops the list for <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-tornadoes-and-thunderstorms\">tornadoes per state</a> for 2021. But researchers believe <a href=\"/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">tornado alley is shifting</a>, and having Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia in the top ten seems to support their observations.</p>\n<p>Tornadoes are also touching down at odd times of the year, like the storm cell that started in Arkansas on December 10, 2021 and moved through several states, including Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The National Weather Service confirmed <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/crh/dec112021\">66 tornadoes</a> on that day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d15billioninwildfiredamage\">$1.5 Billion in Wildfire Damage</h2>\n<p>In drought-stricken California, wildfires destroyed or damaged 3,629 structures. Arizona saw five major fires, while Oregon and Washington each added four more. Six additional states each had at least one major wildfire in 2021.</p>\n<p>Altogether, wildfires accounted for $1.5 billion of US natural disaster property costs. Sadly, the <a href=\"/blog/wildfire-risk/\">wildfire predictions for 2022</a> indicate we’ll see much of the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2floodscausedd27billionindamage\">2 Floods Caused $2.7 Billion in Damage</h2>\n<p>NOAA identifies only two flood events that <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/2021\">hit the billion dollar mark</a>: one in California and one in Louisiana. That might make some people think that flooding is a minor issue, but you should note that floods can happen almost anywhere, and they’re the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/floods\">most common natural disaster</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also note that flooding is generally not covered by homeowners insurance – including floods caused by hurricane storm surge. For that risk, you need separate <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood coverage</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>We’ve all seen those HGTV shows where a buyer just can’t get past the color of the room no matter how many times the agent says it’s easy to repaint. First impressions are key, and selling a home is all about enabling potential homebuyers to envision themselves living in it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/home-staging-tips-first-timers/\">Home staging</a> is the art that allows buyers to see the space as livable. In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/profile-of-home-staging\">77 percent of buyer’s agents</a> believe that home staging makes it easier for buyers to visualize themselves living there.</p>\n<p>But sometimes traditional staging isn’t feasible for many reasons. Luckily there are tech alternatives that can save you the backache of moving a bunch of furniture around while allowing buyers to see a staged home. It’s called virtual staging.</p>\n<p>Virtual staging programs allow you to arrange computer-generated furnishings and props in the right places so that your bare-bones listing goes from weak to chic. Let's look at how virtual staging can help sell your home or listing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howvirtualstagingworks\">How Virtual Staging Works</h2>\n<p>You begin by uploading a photo of the (ideally empty) space to a virtual staging platform (we’ll talk more about platforms in a bit). Then you can place computer-generated furniture and accessories from the platform’s catalog around the space to make it feel like home.</p>\n<p>You can easily switch out pieces with the tap of a finger. Here’s a video that shows the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentousevirtualstaging\">When to Use Virtual Staging</h2>\n<p>Staged homes get offers that are <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2017-profile-of-home-staging-07-06-2017.pdf\">1 percent to 5 percent higher</a>, according to the National Association of Realtors. However, if your listing falls into one of the following categories, virtual staging is may be a good option for you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Traditional stagers aren’t accessible in the home’s area.</li>\n<li>The property is vacant.</li>\n<li>Money is tight, and there's no room in the budget for staging.</li>\n<li>The property has become stagnant after sitting on the market for months.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"howtochooseagoodvirtualstagingcompany\">How to Choose a Good Virtual Staging Company</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of companies in the virtual staging space, so you have plenty of options in finding the one that’s right for you. Here are the questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What digital furnishings does the company offer?</li>\n<li>How long is the turnaround time?</li>\n<li>How realistic do the images look?</li>\n<li>Does the company have an on-staff interior designer to consult on projects?</li>\n<li>How much does the company charge per edited photo? What are the pricing tiers?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"afewvirtualstagingoptions\">A Few Virtual Staging Options</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.boxbrownie.com/\">Box Brownie</a> offers a variety of photo editing services including furniture addition, photo retouching and item removal. The company is well-known for its day-to-dusk edited shots that replace a daytime sky with pretty sunset colors or an inviting twilight backdrop for just $4 a photo.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.inman.com/2016/10/18/vht-studios-launches-virtual-staging-suite/\">VHT Studios</a> is a major real estate photography and marketing services firm that launched a virtual staging suite in 2016. The company will virtually stage, paint, redecorate, or declutter your photos at different price tiers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.spotlessagency.com/\">Spotless Agency</a> takes your high-resolution property photos and virtually stages them according to your preferred style. To get a feel for your desired design, they ask you to send in two or three interior home shots via Google or Pinterest that you like for inspiration. Then they’ll turn around your staged photos in as soon as one to four days, depending on which pricing tier you select.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.padstyler.com/index.php?page=home\">PadStyler</a> charges $59 per photo, guarantees a two-day turnaround and doesn’t charge extra for revisions. The company goes so far as to offer “virtual curb appeal” by adding digital trees and shrubbery to your exterior photos or making the lawn a bright shade of green.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://virtuallystagingproperties.com/\">Virtually Staging Properties</a> charges $85 for one photo and promises best-in-class realistic photos with a focus on virtually staging vacant homes to help them sell faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we move into a buyer’s market, be sure not to mislead buyers with your virtual staging. The best practice is to be upfront and disclose when posting virtually staged photos on the MLS or any other marketing materials. It would be terrible to have buyers show up to look at the beautifully staged home only to find it vacant in real life.</p>"

    body: "<p>Homeowners insurance does cover some types of water damage, but a standard policy does not cover flood damage. That’s important to know wherever you live, but it may be especially key if you’re in an area that may see hurricanes.</p>\n<p>The official start of hurricane season in the Atlantic is a few months away – that’s June 1, so mark your calendars! – but it’s never too early to prepare. Asking questions about how your homeowners insurance handles water damage can help you ensure you’ve got the appropriate coverage in place.</p>\n<p>Here’s an overview of <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-my-home-insurance-policy/\">what your homeowners policy covers</a> – and what it doesn’t – when it comes to floods and water damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatscoveredwaterdamagethatstartsinsideyourhouse\">What’s covered: Water damage that starts inside your house</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, if you have a home insurance written as an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>, the insurance offers coverage for two types of water damage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water damage that originates inside your home.</strong> Pipes and appliances that suddenly burst or start leaking are the two biggest culprits of this type of damage. They can wreak serious havoc, often damaging entire sections of a house, and replacements can be expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Water damage that results from covered property damage.</strong> HO3 policies cover damage from “fallen objects,” so if a tree branch collapses your ceiling during a rainstorm your homeowners insurance can usually cover for the water damage, because it was enabled by the covered fallen tree branch. (Ditto for water that gets in because of other types of covered events.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s a big caveat here, though: this coverage exists, as we mentioned, if your homeowners insurance is written on an HO3 policy. If you’ve got coverage on <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">form HO1</a> (also called a “named perils” policy) or <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2</a>, you may not enjoy these same protections.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure which type of coverage you have, take a look at your policy. If your current policy is on an HO1 or HO2 form, then you may want to consider calling us or <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">applying for a new policy online</a>.</p>\n<p>Florida and Louisiana homeowners can talk to our Kinfolk about getting an HO3 policy. Homeowners in other states will hear about our new <a href=\"/home-insurance/house-and-property-insurance/\">House & Property insurance</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatcoveragesapply\">What coverages apply?</h3>\n<p>Assuming your homeowners policy protects against external water damage, then you likely have two specific coverage parts that apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage A. Also called <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>, Coverage A helps pay for repairs to the structure of your home when it’s damaged by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>. For example, water damage to your floor may trigger your dwelling coverage if it was caused by a pipe burst.</li>\n<li>Coverage C. This is also known as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a> because it covers your belongings. So if that same pipe burst ended up destroying your computer, Coverage C typically kicks in to protect against the loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two coverage parts are the most likely to apply to water damage, but others can be involved depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsnotcoveredwaterdamagethatstartsoutside\">What’s not covered: Water damage that starts outside</h2>\n<p>Nearly all standard homeowners insurance policies exclude <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">coverage for floods</a>, which insurance companies consider to be water damage that starts outside your home.</p>\n<p>If this is a surprise to you, you’re not alone: one study found that 56 percent of homeowners mistakenly believe that their homeowners policy offers flood protection.</p>\n<p>So what does an insurance company consider a “flood?” Any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rising waters, whether from unusual rainfall or because of backed up storm drains in your area.</li>\n<li>Rising mud from similar causes.</li>\n<li>Water that flows into your home because of a malfunctioning municipal sewage system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flood coverage isn’t just for homeowners in designated <a href=\"/blog/how-are-floodplains-determined-for-homeowners/\">floodplains</a>, either: more than 20 percent of NFIP claims come from homeowners who live outside these areas.</p>\n<p>The reasons are complex, but one cause could be that NFIP’s maps of floodplains are notoriously inaccurate. Another possible cause? Climate change. As serious storms increase in frequency and severity, flooding will be the new normal for more and more Americans, whether because they’re in a low-lying area or because the local storm drains aren’t able to keep up with the rainfall and debris.</p>\n<h3 id=\"othertypesofwaterdamagethatarentcovered\">Other types of water damage that aren’t covered</h3>\n<p>We like to make a point that floods aren’t covered by home insurance because of the amount of damage they can cause. However, other types of water damage are also typically excluded, such as those caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor maintenance and neglect.</li>\n<li>A damaged water main.</li>\n<li>An earthquake.</li>\n<li>An outside sewer or drain. (You may be able to get an endorsement for <a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">water backup and sump pump overflow</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, home insurance may pay for repairs caused by leaky windows, but it typically won’t pay to repair or replace the windows themselves unless they were damaged in a covered event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aspecialnoteonfloodinsuranceforfloridahomeowners\">A special note on flood insurance for Florida homeowners</h2>\n<p>One final consideration regarding <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>: while wind damage from hurricanes is covered by standard homeowners policies, it may be subject to a special <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>. In other words, if you file a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane home insurance</a>, you may be responsible for paying more than your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard deductible</a> toward repairing that damage before you’re eligible to collect funds from your insurer.</p>\n<p>That’s one way insurance companies manage their risk during times of high claim frequency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>If you have only standard homeowners insurance, you’re probably not covered for flood damage. If you’d like flood insurance, your Kin representative can help you secure coverage.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in May 2018.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whyyoushouldmeetyourneighborsandhowtodoit\">Why You Should Meet Your Neighbors – And How to Do It</h2>\n<p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/CityObservatory_Less_In_Common.pdf\">report</a>, only about 20 percent of Americans say they regularly spend time with their neighbors. That’s down from 30 percent in the 1970s, when respondents reported spending time with their neighbors at least twice a week.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Getting to know your neighbors helps build <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-secured-community/\">community</a> and keeps your neighborhood (and family) safe.</p>\n<p>Plus, positive relationships with neighbors can come in handy if your car needs a jump or if you need someone to keep an eye on your house <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-and-vacations/\">while you’re out of town</a>.</p>\n<p>Growing your social network may not feel as urgent as completing your first round of renovations and establishing a <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance</a> schedule, but you shouldn’t wait too long before introducing yourself to the folks next door – after all, it takes a while to go from friendly neighbors to neighbors who are friends.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at five ways to make friends in your new neighborhood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Only about 20% of Americans say they regularly spend time with their neighbors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"1findoutwholivesonyourstreet\">1. Find Out Who Lives on Your Street</h3>\n<p>Online groups and apps can help you meet and connect with your neighbors. And they’re a great place to start.</p>\n<p>Search for a neighborhood group on Facebook or locate your neighborhood on <a href=\"https://nextdoor.com/\">NextDoor</a> to find out who lives on your street and in your neighborhood. Both platforms also have an app, so you can check in with meetup groups on the go.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in analog opportunities to meet your neighbors, look for local newspapers and alt weeklies to find out what’s going on in your neck of the woods. If you’re not sure what’s available, the Library of Congress provides an excellent (and nerdy) <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/\">search tool</a> to help find publications near you.</p>\n<p>Your city’s municipal website may include a list of neighborhood listservs, which will deliver pertinent local news to your inbox. The city website is also a great place to get the details on local events, like festivals and town hall meetings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2attendlocalforums\">2. Attend Local Forums</h3>\n<p>Ask your real estate agent if your areas is governed by a community organization or neighborhood board. In some places, this may be called a block club or a neighborhood group.</p>\n<p>Depending on the size of your city, school board and city council meetings may be among the best venues for getting a sense of what’s going on in your neighborhood. The first time you go may feel intimidating, but you’re sure to learn a lot about infrastructure projects, new taxes, and local politics.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, these meetings are a chance to pick up talking points for the next time you run into a neighbor. Who knows – you may pick up some hot gossip while you’re there.</p>\n<p>If you’ve bought a condo, you may have the opportunity to participate in condo board meetings. In fact, you may be obligated to. If this is the case, embrace the opportunity to get to know your neighbors, their values, and how they connect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3getoutside\">3. Get Outside</h3>\n<p>Go for a walk around the block or take the kids to the park. Visit any restaurants or shops that are accessible by foot to get the lay of the land, and you’ll soon become a familiar face in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Folks may try to give you space when you first move in to let you settle and unpack. Whether you’re doing landscaping or relaxing on the porch, going outside signals that you’re open to relaxing and socializing.</p>\n<p>The trick is to make yourself accessible, and leaving the house accomplishes that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4seekopportunitiestosocialize\">4. Seek Opportunities to Socialize</h3>\n<p>Perhaps your move was rooted in a desire for change. Unless that change includes a secluded cabin and years off the grid, consider it part of your relocation project to get out there and get involved in your new community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look for volunteer opportunities</strong>. Whether the community garden needs helping hands or a local festival is looking for assistance selling tickets, volunteer opportunities are a low-commitment way to get to know some of your neighbors.</li>\n<li><strong>Walk dogs at the local shelter</strong>. Okay, this also counts as volunteering, but if you’re on the shy side, it may help to have a canine interlocutor to break the ice. Of course, you can also adopt a dog to build your credentials at the dog park. If you do choose to bring a pup home, there are <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">a few considerations</a> to take into account when it comes to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. And of course, your furry friend has to be the right choice for your family.</li>\n<li><strong>Join an adult recreation league or meetup group</strong>. Sports are an easy way to get involved with a group of people without having to talk about yourself. Get to know which of your neighbors share your interests by seeking out online meetup groups or joining a local team at the town rec facility.</li>\n<li><strong>Borrow a cup of sugar</strong>. Or something small. Start the chain of exchange with your neighbors in whatever way makes you feel most comfortable. It can be hard to figure out what kind of cookies the neighbors might appreciate (given allergies and dietary restrictions), but that doesn’t mean you can’t take the first step toward a friendship. Don’t hesitate to knock on your neighbor’s door to introduce yourself. Your recent move is pretext enough for a conversation. And they’ll appreciate that you care <a href=\"/blog/good-fences-make-good-neighbors/\">whose fence line you share</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However you choose to approach neighborhood engagement, it’s up to you to find your place in the community. While you may be lucky enough to get a personal invitation to a soccer league, be prepared to seek out these connections yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5hostahousewarmingparty\">5. Host a Housewarming Party</h3>\n<p>Once you’re done <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">decorating your home</a>, you may feel ready to open the doors. Whether you’re game for an indoor potluck or prepared to host a low-key barbeque, the best way to get to know your neighbors is to invite them over for an afternoon.</p>\n<p>To make sure the event is well-attended, hand-deliver invitations so folks know whose home they’re being invited to. If the idea of hosting an all-night party makes you feel exhausted, consider advertising it as an afternoon meet-and-greet that’s only a couple of hours long. By putting hours on the invitation, you set clear expectations for your guests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your new house is your home for the long haul, and building quality relationships takes time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"ittakestimetobuildstrongties\">It Takes Time to Build Strong Ties</h2>\n<p>Say yes to new opportunities, but don’t be too hard on yourself if friendships don’t seem to stick right away. It may take a while to feel at home in your new neighborhood, even as you grow accustomed to the locations of your house’s light switches.</p>\n<p>Talking to your neighbors can help you find out how to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare for local weather</a> and what kinds of security measures they take. You just might find someone you trust enough to hold onto a spare set of keys in case you ever get locked out.</p>\n<p>There are many benefits to meeting and getting to know your neighbors, and some of them, like trust, can’t be rushed. Your new house is your home for the long haul, and building quality relationships takes time. What’s important is that you get started.</p>"

    body: "<p>As a homeowner, you’re responsible for keeping your home in good condition. This is something that you want to do to keep it in suitable living condition for you and your family, but it is also vital to reduce the chances of something really going wrong and leading to wear and tear your home insurance doesn’t cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcountsaswearandtear\">What counts as wear and tear?</h2>\n<p>Here’s what we consider a worst-case scenario at Kin: you find an insurance policy, pay your premiums year after year, and go to make a claim one day only to find that your policy doesn’t actually cover what you thought it did.</p>\n<p>Which leads us to the point: we get a lot of questions about wear and tear and whether home insurance covers it. In short, it doesn't, and here's why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acutedamagevswearandtear\">Acute damage vs. wear and tear</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> is designed to help homeowners manage the financial risk they have from damage to their homes that’s outside their control. The thinking is this: sometimes, things go wrong in ways you can’t control (lightning strikes, tree limbs fall, etc.). While you can’t increase your control over these events, you can control their potential to cause you financial damage – which you do by buying homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Those beyond-your-control events are instances of acute damage: all of a sudden, something is deeply wrong.</p>\n<p>The other kind of damage that happens to homes is wear and tear. Wear and tear happens gradually, over time. It includes things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exterior paint peeling.</li>\n<li>Wooden floors getting scuffed or chipped.</li>\n<li>Hinges and door handles loosening.</li>\n<li>Boards warping and separating.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Roof</a> shingles loosening.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like acute damage, wear and tear can lead to expensive problems. Think of a window crack that lets in water that causes extensive mold growth.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance explicitly doesn’t cover damage from wear and tear because part of the agreement between you and your insurance provider is that you’ll keep your home in good working order. In other words: by <a href=\"/blog/diy-home-inspection/\">performing basic maintenance</a>, you will prevent damage.</p>\n<p>If you follow this line of thinking long enough, you’ll find lots of gray area. For example, one common question we hear is, “Does homeowners insurance cover roof leaks?”</p>\n<p>The answer: it depends.</p>\n<p>If the roof leak was caused by a covered property peril (i.e., by a kind of property damage that your insurance policy protects), the answer is yes.</p>\n<p>If the leak happened because you didn’t make basic repairs to your roof or didn’t update it within a reasonable timeframe, the answer is probably no.</p>\n<p>But what if the roof leak happened because shingles blew off in high winds? On the one hand, wind is usually a covered peril, but on the other, if the shingles blew off because you weren’t diligent about maintaining them, your insurance provider could conceivably deny coverage for the resulting damage to your home.</p>\n<p>The lesson here: it’s important to maintain your home as part of protecting your investment in it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtominimizewearandtearonyourhome\">How to minimize wear and tear on your home</h2>\n<p>So what kinds of maintenance projects should homeowners do on a regular basis? The list is long and includes things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.</strong> Getting notification early on saves property and lives. Put it on the calendar to check alarms twice a year.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure gutters are clear, and drainage spouts point away from the house</strong>. Water pooling alongside your house can lead to structural damage and rot.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear plants that could grow in cracks.</strong> These can cause serious structural damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Caulk holes</strong> This keeps pests out and heat in.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect the exterior.</strong> Look for signs it’s<a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\"> time to replace your roof</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your plumbing.</strong> Investigate for leaks (in all seasons) and freezing (in the winter).</li>\n<li><strong>Check for insects.</strong> <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">Termite damage isn’t covered by home insurance</a>, so you need to nip an infestation in the bud to make sure there isn’t a problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Check for mold.</strong> Like termite damage, <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance doesn’t cover mold</a> in most situations. If you have a large area of mold, you may need to contact a mold remediation company to get rid of it properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These items only scratch the surface, of course.

    body: "<p>It’s hard to get through the day without talking about the weather. Every day, billions of us look to the sky and wonder what will fall from it (if anything), and whether or not it will fall on them. And then there are meteorologists, who know exactly what will fall from the sky and exactly when it will happen.</p>\n<p>And then (stay with us) there are <em>forensic</em> meteorologists, a subset of weather sleuths who can figure out not only what’s going to fall from the sky but how various weather patterns impacted property damage or a crime scene.</p>\n<p>Their job is basically <em>CSI: Weather</em> and they’re playing an increasing role in how your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">property insurance</a> claims are handled. Why? Because the <a href=\"https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/extreme-weather\">weather is getting more extreme</a>.</p>\n<p>The good news: by understanding not only how to prepare for extreme weather but also how to think like a forensic meteorologist to prepare for your next weather-related insurance claim, you can ensure your next serious weather event goes as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatexactly_is_aforensicmeteorologist\">What Exactly <em>Is</em> a Forensic Meteorologist?</h2>\n<p>For one thing, it’s a job title that’s hard to spell in a hurry. Beyond that, forensic meteorologists are weather investigators who specialize in reconstructing past events (hence the comparison to <em>CSI</em>).</p>\n<p>And while the whole idea of forensic meteorology may sound like some tech-age buzz, people have in fact been relying on it since at least the 1800s, according to court records. In one famous example, a young lawyer named <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/lincoln-almanac-murder\">Abraham Lincoln discredited a witness</a> using meteorological evidence.</p>\n<p>His source? The 1857 <em>Farmer’s Almanac</em>. Sure, that probably wouldn’t hold up in court today, but at the time it was considered a slam dunk.</p>\n<p>Maybe the most important takeaway here: Lincoln was not a forensic meteorologist. But by learning to think like one, he won his case and went on to become US President (though we are obligated to say here that results may vary).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoforensicmeteorologistsgetinvolvedinpropertyclaims\">When Do Forensic Meteorologists Get Involved in Property Claims?</h2>\n<p>The typical process of making a property insurance claim goes something like this: your property is damaged, you call your insurance provider, they send out a claims adjuster to look at the damage, and you get paid to repair or replace your damaged property according to the terms of your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>A forensic meteorologist might enter the picture if your property damage is weather-related and there’s some uncertainty in the matter. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your house has holes on the northern exposure that look like hail damage</strong> – but there was no hail all day downtown where you work. Was it a microburst? Maybe. Your insurance provider might send a forensic meteorologist to check as part of processing your property insurance claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Your house floods</strong> – but it’s not clear whether the water came from the rising river (which would likely be covered by your flood insurance) or from a sewer that backed-up because of groundwater (which would likely be covered by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, if you have the right endorsement). Again, a forensic meteorologist might be called out to look for clues as to what happened.</li>\n<li><strong>A tree branch falls on your roof while you’re on vacation</strong>. The neighbor says it was because of a bad storm that happened – but you (and your insurance provider) suspect that the neighbor’s haphazard trimming was to blame. A weather sleuth might be put on the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And because the biggest trend in weather in recent decades has been increasing intensity of events, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/atmospheric-scientists-including-meteorologists.htm\">the demand for forensic meteorology is growing</a>.</p>\n<p>In Florida in particular, <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2019/01/30/516098.htm\">property insurance claims are on the rise</a>, and forensic meteorologists are increasingly being called in to help settle these cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A forensic meteorologist might help settle uncertainty in a weather-related property claim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howforensicmeteorologistshelpreduceinsurancefraud\">How Forensic Meteorologists Help Reduce Insurance Fraud</h2>\n<p>So why would an insurance company call in a forensic meteorologist when it has an agreement with you, the homeowner, to cover certain types of property damage? Trust us, there’s a good answer.</p>\n<p>Property insurance claims are both the most common and the most expensive insurers have to handle. That’s the first piece of the puzzle. Then consider the increase in extreme weather and the rise in recent years of billion-dollar weather events.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Billion%20Dollar%20Weather%20Frequency.png?width=600&name=Billion%20Dollar%20Weather%20Frequency.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2018s-billion-dollar-disasters-context\"><em>Source</em></a></p>\n<p>(Of note to Kin customers: these events have been particularly hard on residents of Florida and Texas, thanks to their large coastal exposure. That's one reason <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is so expensive.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Disasters%201980-2018.png?width=600&name=Disasters%201980-2018.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Source</em></p>\n<p>Now consider that fraudulent claims account for about <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-insurance-fraud\">10 percent</a> of the property-casualty insurance industry’s losses each year.</p>\n<p>Boom. All of a sudden, weather is causing more property damage than ever and is therefore costing insurance companies more money than ever. And, as costs overall go up, it stands to reason that the costs from fraudulent claims are going up – even if fraud overall remains a relatively small portion of costs.</p>\n<p>So the simplest way to reduce costs even as weather damage increases is to minimize the number of fraudulent claims insurance companies pay by doing better to sniff out fraud.</p>\n<p>To answer that question from the start of this section: insurance providers are increasingly calling in forensic meteorologists to investigate weather-related property insurance claims as part of their overall cost-control measures.</p>\n<p>Employing these weather sleuths, in other words, is one way insurance companies can ensure that they’re only paying out on legitimate property insurance claims. This, in turn, means they can keep a lid on premiums that homeowners have to pay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Weather is causing more property damage than ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"acloserlookatextremeweather\">A Closer Look at Extreme Weather</h2>\n<p>As a homeowner, one of your jobs is to prepare for the weather events most likely to affect your region. That’s why it’s important to understand the ways weather is changing.</p>\n<p>One trend to keep an eye on is that it’s getting rainier. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) compiled <a href=\"https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/extreme-weather#graphic-20984\">a report on extreme weather events</a> that shows huge increases in extreme rainfall in the United States since the 1950s.</p>\n<p>![NCA-Chart](https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/NCA-Chart.png?width=428&amp;name=NCA-Chart.png =428x)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/extreme-weather#graphic-20984\">Source</a></p>\n<p>If you live in Houston, you got an all-too-real illustration of this trend when Hurricane Harvey struck in 2017, bringing record rainfall. The <a href=\"https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20185070\">U.S. Geological Survey’s report</a> on that storm called it “the most significant rainfall event in United States history in scope and rainfall totals since rainfall records began during the 1880s.” As the chart above shows, things are only likely to get rainier from here.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, most cities face the same challenge Houston faced: there was nowhere for all of that water to go, which led to historic flooding.</p>\n<p>But rainfall isn’t the only type of extreme weather that’s increasing. It’s getting hotter, too, which can lead to drier conditions and more fires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Screen-Shot-2019-03-28-at-1.14.03-PM.png?width=428&name=Screen-Shot-2019-03-28-at-1.14.03-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/extreme-event-attribution-climate-versus-weather-blame-game\">Source</a></p>\n<p>And as mentioned earlier, other types of harsh weather are also on the rise. So given the new realities of extreme weather events, how can homeowners protect their houses and possessions? Glad you asked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourhomefromweatherwithinsurancediligence\">Protect Your Home from Weather with Insurance &amp; Diligence</h2>\n<p>Protecting your home from extreme weather is a two-part job: physically prepare as best you can for bad weather (by making sure your roof can handle strong hurricane winds, for example) and investing in the insurance policies that will compensate you if your home is damaged by an extreme weather event.</p>\n<p>This is where it’s important to know <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">which disasters are covered</a> by which insurance policy.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure which kinds of coverage you’re most likely to need, <a href=\"/blog/check-your-flood-risk/\">check your flood risk</a> as a starting point. Or you can reach out to your homeowners insurance agent and ask for their recommendations.</p>\n<p>Now for the physical preparation part. In any region, there are a few common-sense steps you can take to prepare your property for severe weather:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your trees trimmed and away from your windows and roof.</li>\n<li>Make sure your roof is in good repair and sturdy enough for high winds (if you’re in a high-wind area).</li>\n<li>Add a lightning rod to lower the likelihood that your house will be struck.</li>\n<li>Secure or store any outdoor furniture when not in use. Strong wind can turn it into projectiles!</li>\n<li>Keep your cars and bikes sheltered in the garage or under the carport.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"intheeventofweatherdamagethinklikeaforensicmeteorologist\">In the Event of Weather Damage, Think Like a Forensic Meteorologist</h2>\n<p>Even the best-prepared and best-protected homes, however, can be damaged by bad weather. In the event that there is damage to your property, think like a forensic meteorologist to make it easy for your insurance carrier to process your claim fast:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Document the damage</strong>. Take pictures of the damage and make notes about things you notice. The sooner you capture all this, the better.</li>\n<li><strong>Communicate with your insurance provider</strong>. If they reach out, respond as quickly as you can. If they send an expert to inspect your property, be sure to give them whatever access you need to make a report.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay safe</strong>. Some weather damage can make your home dangerous to be in. Never jeopardize your own safety to document damage; instead, contact your insurance provider and they’ll send an expert (or a drone, as Kin did <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">after Hurricane Irma</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Still have questions about weather-related property insurance claims?

    body: "<p>Home insurance isn’t nearly as difficult as you might think. But like any industry, we may use language that seems unfamiliar to people who don’t regularly work with it.</p>\n<p>A good example of this is “other structures.” Sometimes our representatives ask if a homeowner has any additional structures on their property, and the homeowner says they don’t. However, that’s seldom true.</p>\n<p>We think we can clear up this misunderstanding pretty easily so that people can get the right amount of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Read on to learn more about what other structures are, how they’re covered, and why that matters to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherstructuresaninsurancedefinition\">Other Structures: An Insurance Definition</h2>\n<p>Much of the confusion about other structures comes from people thinking that it’s just another way of saying “other buildings.” However, there are a lot of things that can count as other structures, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detached garages.</li>\n<li>Barns.</li>\n<li>Sheds.</li>\n<li>Gazebos.</li>\n<li>Pools.</li>\n<li>Fences.</li>\n<li>Driveways.</li>\n<li>Sidewalks.</li>\n<li>Permanently installed or anchored docks with their permanently installed equipment such as lifts and launches.</li>\n<li>Hot tubs.</li>\n<li>Other permanently installed outdoor fixtures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a pretty long list of other structures, and there’s a good chance your property has one or more of the items on it. But that’s okay, because your home insurance policy most likely covers them.</p>\n<p>You can usually find coverage for the structures on your property that aren’t attached to your <a href=\"/glossary/dwelling-means/\">dwelling</a> under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a> ﹘ the section that’s actually called “other structures.” Attached structures, like a porch or carport, often fall under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>. However, this can vary by insurance company, as can coverage for swimming pools. Some policies cover pools with Coverage A, but others use Coverage B.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchotherstructurescoverageshouldihave\">How Much Other Structures Coverage Should I Have?</h2>\n<p>We generally recommend you carry a minimum other structures coverage limit that’s 10 percent of your dwelling coverage. This may be enough to cover all of your other structures, but that really depends on your answers to several questions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What type and how many other structures are on your property?</li>\n<li>How much your other structures are worth?</li>\n<li>What can you afford to repair if you face a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answering these questions gives you an idea of how much you might have to pay if you experience catastrophic damage and how much risk you’re willing to take on. You can always decide to carry higher limits if it makes sense for your situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caniremoveotherstructurescoverage\">Can I Remove Other Structures Coverage?</h2>\n<p>You may be able to opt out of other structures coverage, but we don’t recommend it. The additional structures may not seem like a major expense, but they definitely can be. We looked at several sites to give you a sense of what it costs to rebuild or replace structures homeowners commonly have on their property. The results are in the chart below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagebuildingcostsofcommonstructures\">Average Building Costs of Common Structures</h3>\n<p>| Structure | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shed | $15 to $160 per square foot |\n| Driveway | $3 to $30 per square foot |\n| Hot tub | $2,000 to $8,000 |\n| Deck | $15 to $30 per square foot |\n| Fence | $15 to $60 per foot |</p>\n<p>You also want to think about how likely you are to suffer some sort of damage to the other structures on your property. Anything that might wreck your home could just as easily ruin your other structures. For example, you want to be prepared if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning sets your gazebo on fire.</li>\n<li>High winds blow over your fence.</li>\n<li>A tree falls on your carport.</li>\n<li>Hail damages your pool liner.</li>\n<li>An errant driver knocks your garage off its foundation.</li>\n<li>A thief steals valuable tools from your garden shed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you look at all the items on your property that you need to protect, plus the risk of having to replace them, carrying at least the minimum Coverage B limit makes a ton of sense.</p>\n<p>Getting other structures coverage is simple when you work with us. But you can always talk to one of our insurance experts if you have questions. They’re happy to walk through every structure on your property to make sure that you have enough of the right amount of coverage.</p>"

The lights in your home flicker.</p>\n<p>That flicker may seem benign, but it's actually a sign of an unseen threat: power surges. Your lights may come back on without a hitch, but that’s usually accompanied by a surge in energy that can damage your home electronics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcausespowersurges\">What Causes Power Surges?</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"/blog/effects-of-thunderstorms/\">thunderstorms</a> are the easiest culprit to pin a power surge on, these events happen even when the weather is perfect. Electric companies can produce a power surge when they switch from running on one grid to another, or you may cause one when you plug too many devices into an extension cord. Your own appliances, especially high-powered ones like your refrigerator, may even cause a surge as they switch on and off.</p>\n<p>In each of these situations, one of two things is happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The flow of electricity has been momentarily interrupted and then started again.</li>\n<li>Something caused electricity to run back into the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s this sudden flow of electricity back through the circuit that causes a power surge.</p>\n<p>Most household appliances run on 120 volts, but the electrical flow is rarely a constant 120 volts. Typically, voltage fluctuates between 0 and 169 volts. Small surges for things like turning on a hairdryer can be anywhere from five to 10 volts, but a massive power surge sends voltage above 169 volts and that can lead to damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdamagecanpowersurgescause\">What Damage Can Power Surges Cause?</h2>\n<p>Power surges can affect home appliances and electronics. As electricity surges over the acceptable voltage range, it causes an arc of current. This arc generates heat and causes the circuit boards and other electrical components to overheat, and that can lead to degradation and damage.</p>\n<p>Often the damage caused by power surges is cumulative. This means that your television might work today but suddenly stop tomorrow if your home is experiencing a lot of electrical surges. But massive surges like those caused by lightning strikes can fry a system immediately.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that anything with a microprocessor is particularly vulnerable to power surges. Microprocessors aren’t just found in your computers and microwaves, either. Your dishwasher, refrigerator, and other appliances may all have microprocessors that make them susceptible to damage from power surges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreventpowersurges\">How to Prevent Power Surges</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of common ways to keep power surges from affecting your appliances and electronics. The simplest is to unplug items if your power goes out. Unplugging everything that runs on electricity prevents a huge current from flowing into these items when the power turns back on. Most experts recommend just leaving one lamp plugged in so you know when the power returns. Once it’s back on, you can plug your electronics back in one by one.</p>\n<p>Other ways to protect your home from power surges involve additional equipment, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Point-of-use surge protectors:</strong> Point-of-use surge protectors look like power strips that you plug into a wall outlet. You then plug your appliance or electronic device into the point-of-use unit. Not all power strips are surge protectors, so make sure you find the right type.</li>\n<li><strong>Special electrical outlets:</strong> These are designed to cut power to the unit if there is a surge and are commonly used in areas where power strips are not convenient but there is a need to manage the voltage used when appliances are plugged in. For example, you might want one for the microwave in your kitchen.</li>\n<li><strong>A service entrance device:</strong> This is a type of surge protector that mounts to your electrical panel or meter and protects all the devices plugged into outlets throughout your home. Service entrance devices are installed by electricians and may require a permit for installation depending on your city codes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">Preventing claims</a> is probably one of the most important things you can do as a homeowner. Doing so not only makes your home safer, but it can also help you <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">lower your home insurance premiums</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpowersurges\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Power Surges?</h2>\n<p>If a power surge does damage your appliances or electronics, you may be covered for the loss through your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most home insurance policies have some coverage for sudden, accidental damage from man-made electricity and direct lightning strikes. However, <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">claims for damage that happens over time</a> to electronics and appliances are usually excluded. In some cases, tubes, transistors, and other components aren’t covered either.</p>\n<p>Talk to your representative or read through your policy to see what exactly is covered. Keep in mind that your coverage has a deductible, so it may not be worth making a claim for minor issues.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you’ve been thinking about buying a home, then rapidly rising interest rates have probably set your teeth on edge. The hikes started in mid-March, when the Federal Reserve approved the first interest rate increase in three years, and have continued into early summer.</p>\n<p>Market factors like the Federal Reserve Board certainly impact mortgage interest rates, but they aren’t the only ones that come into play. Here are eight more factors most lenders consider when they determine mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1creditscore\">1. Credit Score</h2>\n<p>Your credit score has a fairly direct impact on your mortgage rate because it tells a lender how consistently you pay off your debts and bills every month. That’s a good indicator of whether or not you're a good risk to lend money to.</p>\n<p>Lenders assume that a higher credit score means you are better at managing your money, and that usually results in a better mortgage interest rate. Most lenders look for credit scores that are at least in the high 600, but there are options for people with low credit scores. For example, <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan requirements</a> list minimum credit scores in the 500s.</p>\n<p>You should also note that your credit score can <a href=\"/blog/does-credit-score-affect-home-insurance-rates/\">affect your homeowners insurance rates</a> in some states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2employmentandincome\">2. Employment and Income</h2>\n<p>Some lenders take a look at your employment and income to determine your mortgage rate. The key here is consistency. Steady employment and income can lower interest rates because it’s a good sign that you make monthly payments. Lenders want consistency even from those who are self employed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3occupancy\">3. Occupancy</h2>\n<p>Getting a mortgage on a home you plan to live in usually comes with a lower interest rate than one for an investment property because investment properties carry more risk. A borrower is more likely to walk away from a property they’re renting to others than they are from their own home. This is generally true for second and vacation homes, too, and it usually means higher mortgage rates for these properties than on owner-occupied properties.</p>\n<p>Occupancy also impacts your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. For an investment property, you may need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>, but a vacation home could require <a href=\"/home-insurance/second-home-insurance/\">second home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4loanamount\">4. Loan Amount</h2>\n<p>Jumbo loans, or also called nonconforming conventional mortgages, can have higher interest rates. This is partially due to the risk. Neither Freddie Mac nor Fannie Mae can guarantee a jumbo loan, leaving the lender unprotected if the borrower defaults. With some exceptions, the current maximum amount for a conforming loan is $647,200 for most of the US. Jumbo loans exceed that amount.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, mortgages that are for a very low amount don’t earn much in terms of interest. Lenders sometimes charge additional fees on smaller loans to cover their costs and turn a profit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5downpayment\">5. Down Payment</h2>\n<p>A down payment shows your lender that you have skin in the game. As a result, your lender may charge a lower interest rate for a larger down payment, assuming that signals you’re more committed to owning and maintaining the property. Some homebuyers even pay points to bring down their loans and get better mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6loanduration\">6. Loan Duration</h2>\n<p>Loans with a longer duration, or loan term, mean the lender takes on more risk, so it usually increases the mortgage rate. For example, a 30-year fixed-rate loan typically has a higher interest rate than a 15-year fixed-rate loan for the same amount.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the loan with the shorter term may have higher monthly payments. The benefit, however, is that you end up paying the principal down faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7interestratetype\">7. Interest Rate Type</h2>\n<p>There are two types of mortgage interest rates: fixed and adjustable. In a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest payment stays the same for the entire term. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), however, changes with the market. ARMs often start with a low introductory rate, but that may increase over time.</p>\n<p>If you decide on an ARM, you want to look closely at the terms of your loan. The low mortgage rate may seem like a way to save money, but it can quickly become more expensive than a fix-rate loan. Learn more about this in our article “How Does Mortgage Interest Work?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"8loantype\">8. Loan Type</h2>\n<p>Homebuyers can choose from several types of loans, including conventional loans and loans backed by the FHA, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Each comes with its own eligibility criteria and interest rates. Lenders can compare the rates of different loans for you if you are eligible for more than one type.</p>\n<p>For more help on mortgage, take a look at our article “<a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">Mortgages Explained: A First-Time Buyer’s Guide</a>.”</p>"

    body: "<p>People get insurance to protect themselves from financial losses that might occur if something terrible happens to their homes. But what happens to homeowners insurance when someone dies?</p>\n<p>The answer, as usual, depends on the insurance company and the policy. But in this case, other factors can play a role, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the deceased was a named insured or an additional insured.</li>\n<li>Whether an executor has been named or not.</li>\n<li>What plans have been made for the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article looks at several possible situations and provides general advice for dealing with house insurance after the death of the policyholder.</p>\n<p>For Kin-specific information, please see our article “<a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-after-death/\">How Kin Handles the Death of a Customer?</a>”</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodowithhomeownersinsuranceduringprobate\">What to do with homeowners insurance during probate</h2>\n<p>Every <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> handles a policyholder’s death differently. Insurers may even have different requirements for different policies. That said, these three steps should hopefully get you on your way to figuring out what to do in your particular situation:</p>\n<h3 id=\"contactyourinsurer\">Contact your insurer</h3>\n<p>As uncomfortable as it may be, you need to let the insurance company know that a policyholder has passed. Most companies give you about 30 days to do this, and many accept a phone call. However, you will likely need to fax or email your insurer a copy of the death certificate.</p>\n<p>Please note that sometimes a death certificate isn’t available as quickly as an insurance company might want it. You still want to let the insurer know about the policyholder’s death. Some may accept other documentation, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A court order.</li>\n<li>The will of the deceased.</li>\n<li>An updated deed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don’t notify the insurance company, it may cancel the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">policy</a>, leaving the home unprotected from loss. This can lead to problems for the executor who is managing the estate or for the person who ultimately inherits the house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkintocoverageoptions\">Check into coverage options</h3>\n<p>When you notify the insurance company, take a moment to ask about coverage options. Many may allow you to keep the same policy until it expires as long as you pay the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-premium-definition/\">premium</a>. Others may ask you to buy a new policy. Be sure to note details, particularly deadlines, so you don’t have an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-lapse/\">insurance lapse</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"askabouthomeownersinsuranceduringprobate\">Ask about homeowners insurance during probate</h3>\n<p>Probate adds another wrinkle to explaining what happens to homeowners insurance when someone dies. The laws governing probate vary by state, so it’s difficult to provide a general description of what to do. Probably the most important step you can take is to keep in touch with the insurer as things change.</p>\n<p>For occupied house insurance during probate, you may want to get coverage in the executor’s name, especially if you plan on selling the property. Another issue to note is whether the house in question is going to be vacant for a month or more. That often requires a different policy called vacant home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtotransferhomeownersinsuranceforestateproperty\">How to transfer homeowners insurance for estate property</h2>\n<p>Transferring <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> on an estate property to a new owner often starts by determining who the deceased person is in relation to the policy. The people protected by a homeowners policy are typically called <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insureds</a>, but there are different types of insureds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/named-insured/\">Named insured</a>, or the person or entity that the policy protects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">Additional insured</a>, or a person or entity added to the policy.On a home insurance policy, the named insured is typically the <a href=\"/glossary/policyholder/\">policyholder</a>, or the person who purchased the coverage. Other family members living in the home are usually considered named insureds, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a primary policyholder has died and there are no other insureds, then the insurance company will likely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need a copy of the death certificate, will, or other documentation.</li>\n<li>Update the named insured to the estate of the deceased.</li>\n<li>Want the name of the estate executor.</li>\n<li>Ask what you plan to do with the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies can usually hold off on making major changes to the policy until an executor is named. Keep in mind, too, that the insurer will likely decide that the policy cannot be renewed, which means you’ll want to be aware of its expiration date to avoid a coverage lapse.</p>\n<p>Once the insurance company knows what’s happening to the house in question, its representative can help you figure out the next steps for transferring the home insurance. For example, if the house is to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transferred to a relative, then you may need to go through the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a> to transfer the policy.</li>\n<li>Rented to someone, then the coverage will need to be rewritten as a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>.</li>\n<li>Sold to a third party, then the insurer will probably cancel the policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, again, that insurance companies can have their own process for transferring home insurance after someone passes. Your insurer’s representative should be able to help you navigate the steps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappenstohomeownersinsurancewhenaspousedies\">What happens to homeowners insurance when a spouse dies?</h3>\n<p>After a spouse passes, the surviving spouse’s status on the home insurance policy can also come into play. Some insurers make both spouses named insureds, while others may choose to have one be the named insured and the other an additional insured.</p>\n<p>Let’s say the primary policyholder, or named insured, has passed away, and the surviving spouse is an additional insured. The insurance company may be able to simply make the surviving spouse the named insured. On the other hand, if the deceased was an additional insured, the primary policyholder remains the named insured.</p>\n<p>Either way, the surviving spouse needs to inform their insurance company to get the process started. Moreover, the insurance company will ultimately need to remove the deceased from the policy. This usually doesn’t happen until the estate has gone through probate.</p>\n<p>While dealing with probate may be a new experience for you, understand that insurance companies deal with homeowners insurance for probate every day. They have policies and procedures to handle the issue. Ask a lot of questions to make sure that you have the right coverage for the home while it transfers from one owner to the heir.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"doesthenfipstillcoveryouduringashutdown\">Does the NFIP still cover you during a shutdown?</h2>\n<p>In January 2018, the federal government shut down for two days when Congress couldn’t agree on a bill to provide continuous funding. One of the affected institutions was the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP (a branch of the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Luckily, funding was restored relatively quickly – but not for the long term. In fact, 2018 saw several close-calls with funding lapses for the program.</p>\n<p>But in December, 2018, the government was shut down again because of funding disagreements over the US-Mexico border wall. During that <a href=\"/blog/how-a-government-shutdown-impacts-homeowners/\">shutdown</a>, the NFIP continued to issue and renew policies.</p>\n<p>There’s no guarantee for long-term funding for the NFIP, which means it could find itself in another precarious situation in the near future. And given the recurring threat of shutdowns amid federal budget negotiations, the increasing frequency of natural disasters, and the federal government’s critical role in<a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\"> providing disaster relief</a>, understanding what happens to the NFIP during a government shutdown is important for policyholders.</p>\n<p>So how might that affect homeowners who live in floodplains? Here’s an overview of what to expect the next time the NFIP temporarily loses funding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoesthenfipneedfundinginthefirstplace\">Why does the NFIP need funding in the first place?</h2>\n<p>The NFIP was created in 1968 to address the reality that private <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> options were falling short. Floods are the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program/\">most common and costliest natural disaster</a> in the country and private insurers were sometimes unable to pay out on claims. The NFIP was developed to offer a government-backed subsidized alternative.</p>\n<p>Today, homes located in a floodplain bought with a mortgage are required to have flood insurance. Some lenders require that the insurance be through NFIP, making the organization an essential part of the home buying process in some parts of the country.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathappensifthenfiplosesfunding\">What happens if the NFIP loses funding?</h2>\n<p>When the government shuts down and the NFIP goes unfunded, a few things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new NFIP flood insurance policies can be written.</li>\n<li>The NFIP cannot renew any policies.</li>\n<li>Home sales in certain areas freeze. If your mortgage company won’t lend you money without NFIP insurance and the NFIP can’t write you a policy, you can’t get the money you need to buy a house. During a four-week shutdown in 2012, the National Association of Realtors estimated that about 1,300 home sales per day were prevented because of missing NFIP funding.</li>\n<li>The NFIP continues to pay out valid claims… until it runs out of money. It cannot pay additional claims until it collects enough in incoming premiums or is allocated more money by Congress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, these are not desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p>What’s really frustrating, though, is that even though there’s general agreement that we need the NFIP, most people think it should be reformed. The thing is, we can’t agree on how to do that. The general attitude seems to be, “Why should we fund something that we know doesn’t work?” This isn’t helpful when nobody can agree on what needs to happen to make it work better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attemptstoimprovethenfip\">Attempts to improve the NFIP</h2>\n<p>In 2012, the Biggert-Waters Act updated the NFIP, which was at the time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program\">more than $17 billion in debt</a>. The update required homeowners to pay insurance rates that matched their risk exposure, based on actuarial tables. It eliminated certain subsidies and the grandfathering in of earlier, lower rates.</p>\n<p>But in 2014, Congress passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which essentially delayed the reforms of Biggert-Waters and, rather than instating risk-based pricing, spread premium increases over all policyholders.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2901\">Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act</a> offers mostly technical updates to current law, but that bill didn’t make it to the Senate.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: while it’s unlikely that lawmakers will agree on a comprehensive overhaul of the NFIP any time soon, it’s equally unlikely that they’ll let millions of homeowners go unprotected for the long term. If this is a matter you think needs more attention from Congress, consider <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members\">contacting the people who represent you</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in early 2018 and is periodically updated to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.</em></p>"

    body: "<p>A four-point inspection is a home inspection that looks at the four major systems of your home and assesses it for risk. The four major systems are your roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems. This inspection is common for older homes, but it’s quick and may open up more home insurance options for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedsa4pointinspectioninflorida\">Who needs a 4-point inspection in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners who have older homes may need a four-point inspection before they can get <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. During a four-point inspection, an inspector evaluates how up-to-date four key systems are in your home, namely your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical wiring and panels.</li>\n<li>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).</li>\n<li>Plumbing.</li>\n<li>Roof.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Four-point inspections identify key areas that most commonly result in insurance claims. If a home fails all or part of the inspection, the inspector will go over what needs to be fixed or replaced to alleviate deficiencies. The fixes may be necessary to obtain insurance.</p>\n<p>You should note that a four-point inspection cannot replace a new <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>. If your home insurance company says you have to have an inspection, be sure to ask specifically <a href=\"/faq/do-you-need-an-inspection-for-homeowners-insurance/\">what type of inspection you need</a>. As a homeowner, you sometimes must provide the right professional inspection report for your property to meet the requirements of getting your house insured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"isa4pointinspectionrequiredinflorida\">Is a 4-point inspection required in Florida?</h3>\n<p>If you own an older home and are up for renewal on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>, or you’re purchasing an older home, chances are you will be asked to submit a four-point inspection as part of the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a>. This practice is most common in Florida and other coastal states.</p>\n<p>There is a basic outline of what’s covered under a four-point inspection; however, each insurance agency has its own set of rules regarding who needs an inspection. The <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/\">International Association of Certified Home Inspections</a> (NACHI) provides a universal four-point inspection form, but using this form isn’t required by law.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4pointinspectionvshomeinspection\">4-point inspection vs. home inspection</h3>\n<p>A four-point inspection is specifically for homeowners insurance, and shouldn’t be confused with a new home inspection (also called a buyers inspection, real estate inspection, home inspection or full inspection depending where you live). This distinction is important because the new home inspection is required to close on a home and meet eligibility criteria for your mortgage. It also takes two to three hours to complete. A four-point inspection takes about 30 minutes and is only visual. However, if you buy an older home you might be required to have both inspections.</p>\n<p>Four-point inspections tend to be more prevalent in coastal states, specifically in Florida and Texas. Coastal areas, like <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/miami/\">Miami</a>, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/jacksonville/\">Jacksonville</a>, experience more inclement weather that leads to catastrophic devastation (loss of life; destruction of entire towns; demolished power grids, roads, airports; etc.). This prompts lawmakers to frequently update building codes. Homes built 40 or more years ago were made in accordance to different standards than those built today, which is why they may not be considered as safe as more modern homes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4pointinspectionvswindmitigationinspection\">4-point inspection vs. wind mitigation inspection</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation\">wind mitigation inspection</a> determines how well your home resists wind damage by going over certain building attributes, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">Roof shape</a>.</li>\n<li>Roof covering.</li>\n<li>Roof-deck attachment.</li>\n<li>Opening protections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As in a four-point inspection, this type of inspection takes a close look at your roof. But a wind mitigation inspection also involves other aspects of your home’s structure and can help you get a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discount on your home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesa4pointinspectioncost\">What does a 4-point inspection cost?</h2>\n<p>You can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $175 for a four-point inspection. The cost varies based on location and inspection company.</p>\n<p>You can usually find affordable services if you do your research. Make sure that the company you call is licensed and has good reviews, as you need it to correctly evaluate your home's current state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your4pointhomeinspectionchecklist\">Your 4-point home inspection checklist</h2>\n<p>A four-point inspection looks at your home’s major systems, but what exactly does the inspector evaluate? Here is a helpful checklist you can review to help you prepare for your four-point inspection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"electricalwiringandpanels\">Electrical wiring and panels</h3>\n<p>What kind of wiring is in your home? If a home has copper, aluminum, or knob-and-tube wires, chances are it will not be insurable due to fire hazard risks. The inspector will also look to see if you have a <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panel</a>.</p>\n<p>Faulty wires cause nearly 90 percent of residential fires, so this is something insurance companies take very seriously. If your home is found uninsurable due to wiring issues, it is vital to budget for necessary upgrades. If you don’t, your risk of fire is significantly amplified.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hvac\">HVAC</h3>\n<p>Does your home have central heating and air conditioning? What condition are the units in? Are there any signs of obvious damage such as leakage? Remember each insurance agency determines what it considers “acceptable” when insuring older homes; however, it’s not uncommon to see coverage denied for lack of central air and heat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plumbing\">Plumbing</h3>\n<p>Inspectors look at the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-plumbing-pipes/\">type of pipes</a> in your home to determine how likely they are to burst. If polybutylene plumbing is found coverage can be denied as these are more prone to bursting. However, some insurance companies may still insure you, but will exclude water damage. In that scenario, if there is a flood due to pipes bursting, you are 100 percent responsible for the total expense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roof\">Roof</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">What’s in a roof</a>? Roof age, material, and condition are what inspectors look for. Generally, insurance companies do not insure shingle roofs more than 20 years old or tile or metal roofs more than 40 years old. However, if your roof is younger but has <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">apparent damage</a> outside or water leaks inside your home, that might be cause to deny coverage.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in December 2020.

    body: "<p>In a cash-out refinance, you take a loan out for the loan balance you already have plus a portion of the equity accumulated in your home. That amount beyond the loan balance can be used for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>Homeowners may use the cash from a cash-out refinance to consolidate debt, get a lower interest rate on credit, pay for a child’s college expenses, or remodel the house. Let’s take a look at when this refinancing option makes sense, according to financial experts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofacashoutrefinance\">The Benefits of a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>For many homeowners, their home is their biggest expense. This means saving even one percent of interest on your <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a> can mean saving hundreds or thousands of dollars every year. For example, a $300,000 mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate is $1,432 a month on a 30-year mortgage. The same mortgage at 3 percent drops to $1,265 a month.</p>\n<p>But that’s if you refinanced the existing mortgage dollar for dollar. What happens if you want to use your refinance to tackle that $15,000 of credit card debt that charges 21 percent interest? By adding the credit card debt to the mortgage, the credit cards are paid and you now pay the interest rate of the mortgage – far less than the credit cards. It’s a way to pay off debt for a more reasonable cost.</p>\n<p>Not everyone uses a cash-out refinance to pay off credit card bills though. Some use the equity in their home to fund their kids’ college education, wedding, or home renovations. Imagine having a home valued at $400,000 with a mortgage of $250,000. That’s $150,000 of equity sitting in your house. Often you can access up to 80 percent of the equity – or in this case, $120,000 to fund the big-ticket items in your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprosandconsofacashoutrefinance\">The Pros and Cons of a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>Like any financial decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of a cash-out refinance. To that end, Rick Orford of <a href=\"https://thefinanciallyindependentmillennial.com/\">The Financially Independent Millennial</a> warns that it isn’t an end-all solution to bad spending habits.</p>\n<p>“It doesn't matter if you earn $50,000 a year, or $150,000 a year,” Orford says, “unless you spend less than you earn, you'll never get ahead.”</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reduce the cost of more expensive debt | Extends your mortgage for a new term |\n| Often lowers your mortgage interest rate | Has closing costs |\n| Affords the opportunity to pay for big-ticket items | Has lengthy underwriting requirements including a credit report and appraisal |</p>\n<p>While it seems like a cash-out refinance would solve a lot of problems, if you don’t plan on living in your home for years to come, it could affect your ability to qualify for another mortgage. You’ll have less equity, have a hard pull on your credit, and will need to account for the cost of an appraisal and closing costs.</p>\n<p>According to Tony Grech of <a href=\"https://www.luxurymortgage.com/\">Luxury Mortgage</a>, “You don’t need perfect credit to get a cash-out refinance, but these types of loans are viewed as much riskier than a purchase or a refinance to simply lower the rate on your loan balance.”</p>\n<p>It takes years to build up equity, and taking on more debt is not always a good idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcanyougetinacashoutrefinance\">How Much Can You Get In a Cash-Out Refinance?</h2>\n<p>In a cash-out refinance, you’re cashing out the equity in your home. How much equity you have will determine how much you can take out. An easy way to roughly calculate your home’s equity is to subtract your mortgage balance from your home’s current market value.</p>\n<p>For example, say your home’s market value is $256,000 and you have a $158,000 mortgage balance. You’d have about $98,000 in equity.</p>\n<p>In many loan circumstances, you can access up to 80 percent of the equity in the home. If we continue the example above, that means you could potentially take out $46,800 in your cash-out refinance.</p>\n<p>Lenders set your borrowing limit at 80 percent of your equity to leave you with a cushion in case the house drops in market value. That way you won’t owe more than the value of the home.</p>\n<p>It also gives the lender a cushion if you default on the property and they need to sell the home. The value will likely still have some equity, leaving them some room to negotiate with buyers.</p>\n<p>There is one exception to the 80 percent rule on a cash-out refinance: if you have a VA loan, you will be able to access up to 100 percent of the equity in the home.</p>\n<p>Exactly how much you can take out may be contingent on lender rules and your creditworthiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesacashoutrefinancework\">How Does a Cash-Out Refinance Work?</h2>\n<p>In order to get a cash-out refinance, you’ll have to qualify for it just like you did with your original mortgage. Lenders want to see at least a FICO credit score of 620, which is higher than a simple refinance score requirement of 580.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to meet the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of less than 50 percent. The DTI ratio is your monthly debt payments divided by your income. This includes your mortgage, car payments, and credit card payments.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you’ll need at least 20 percent equity in your home. This means for every $100,000 your home is valued at, you have at least $20,000 in equity. From there, you’ll be able to pull out up to 80 percent of that equity (or 100 percent if you have a VA loan).</p>\n<h2 id=\"cashoutrefinancevshelochomeequitylineofcredit\">Cash-Out Refinance vs. HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)</h2>\n<p>Homeowners should review the difference between a cash-out refinance and a HELOC to make sure they are doing the best thing for their financial situation. Unlike a refinance, a HELOC uses your equity to fund a line of credit that you can access at will. It often has a variable interest rate that is locked for one to three years.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, you tend to pay lower interest rates on a cash-out refinance than a HELOC. But remember that the loan is fixed for the life of your mortgage whereas a HELOC can be paid down quickly and reused for other purposes. Consider the closing costs along with the interest rate when comparing a refinance with a HELOC. You’ll want to run the numbers to see where you save the most.</p>\n<p>But if you’re doing a renovation of your home, a cash-out refinance can be a powerful financial tool. You’ll get lower interest rates and you’ll invest into the home which will only increase its market value.</p>\n<p>According to Matt Rostosky of <a href=\"https://www.cashofferky.com/\">Good Neighbor Solutions, LLC</a>, “Big-ticket home renovations give you the most out of your cash-out refinance money.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentonottakeacashoutrefinance\">When to Not Take a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>In a cash-out refinance, you assume more debt and lock it in for a 15 to 30-year mortgage, so make sure it makes sense for your financial situation. In most cases, you don’t want to do the refinance if your interest rate will be the same or higher with the refinance. Your whole mortgage will get charged more interest, and that’s typically not a good move.</p>\n<p>It’s also not a good idea to do the cash-out refinance if you can’t consolidate all your high-interest credit debt. If you did the refinance anyway, you’d be paying more for your mortgage and still fighting high-interest rates on credit cards.</p>\n<p>Remember to consider the closing costs of the new loan, too. These costs could be as much as 5 percent of the mortgage amount – that could easily be $10,000 on a $200,000 loan. Make sure that your potential savings will be worth the cost of the loan. Your lender should provide you with a breakeven point that shows you how long into the new loan you will break even with the new costs. If it’s more than two to three years, a cash-out refinance might not be worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestrategicwithcashoutrefinances\">Be Strategic with Cash-Out Refinances</h2>\n<p>A cash-out refinance is a powerful way to tap the equity of your home to help you meet other <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">financial goals</a>. Whether you want to consolidate debt, remodel your home, or pay for college, the cash-out refinance gives you access to capital that’s otherwise tied up in your house. Remember to always consider the costs before doing a refinance so you don’t pay more than you should.</p>"

    body: "<p>The materials used to build your home help determine what your home is worth, as well as its durability, energy efficiency, and sustainability. Building materials can even play a role in the cost of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a>. After all, certain materials can stand up to weather better than others, so they help reduce risk to your home.</p>\n<p>When evaluating house construction types, we can generally group them into four main categories of building materials. These categories are masonry, log, frame, and superior fire-resistive.</p>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at each.</p>\n<h2 id=\"masonry\">Masonry</h2>\n<p>Masonry homes consist of brick and stone structures. Components are put together with mortar. This is typically the most costly type of construction, but it does have its advantages. It has a high fire protection rating because it is non-combustible, plus it holds up better against natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. All of this means home insurance rates on masonry homes are usually lower than on homes built of other materials.</p>\n<p>Masonry construction has two other important benefits. The first is its increased thermal mass that helps the home remain energy efficient. Second, bugs and pests have a hard time penetrating masonry.</p>\n<p>For all of its advantages, masonry does have some limitations. Because it is so heavy, it is difficult and costly to transport. Homebuilders must pay added attention to the foundation because even a little settling can lead to cracks and potential moisture damage. Building these homes requires good weather, further limiting construction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"log\">Log</h2>\n<p>A log home consists of stacked logs where the same wood is seen from the inside as-is from the outside. There are three common house construction types for log homes: full scribe, post and beam, and timber frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full scribe:</strong> The full scribe log home stacks horizontal logs to form walls. Grooves cut into the logs allow them to be stacked snugly together. These homes are known for their energy efficiency and tend to withstand high winds and rains. They’re usually the most expensive to build, requiring more logs, specialized trades, and attention to the detail of eliminating gaps.</li>\n<li><strong>Post and beam:</strong> This type of log home uses full logs placed vertically as structural posts to support horizontal logs beams placed across them for structural support. Post and beam homeowners get maximum insulation and energy efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Timber frame:</strong> These homes are really a hybrid of a log home and a frame home. Logs are first used as posts and beams to hold the structure together and then finished with a square profile so that the rest of the walls can be framed together with traditional timber and siding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While log homes can be energy efficient and durable, they can also be subject to some unique risks﹘like wood-boring insects. However, their mass also means log homes are less likely to burn than a stud and drywall home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frame\">Frame</h2>\n<p>The simplicity, adaptability, and straightforward construction of frame homes make them the most popular house construction type built today. To build a frame house, builders use wood to create a skeleton, or frame, of the entire home. Frame houses typically have larger beams at ends and narrow beams in between with drywall or paneling filling in the spaces in between.</p>\n<p>One of the key benefits of a frame home is the price. Frame homes are relatively simple to build, and until recently, <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber was an affordable building material</a>. Additionally, frame homes let more natural light inside because builders can easily create large windows. In some parts of the country, frame homes are made with extreme high-pitch roofs to protect the house from the weight of snow.</p>\n<p>The drawback, however, is that wood-framed homes are considered more combustible than other types of building materials. That usually means you pay more for your homeowners’ insurance than you might with other types of construction materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"superiorfireresistive\">Superior fire resistive</h2>\n<p>Superior fire-resistive homes are considered non-flammable because they’re made of materials that can withstand high heat and flame, such as concrete. While the contents within the home are flammable, homeowners don’t need to worry about fires, including those starting from electrical components within walls. These homes are also well insulated and don’t fall victim to the attacks of pests.</p>\n<p>These homes can be both expensive and time-consuming to build. However, homeowners do save money on homeowners insurance and energy costs when they opt for fire-resistant materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherstructurematerials\">Other structure materials</h2>\n<p>Some non-traditional homes are built using other materials. For example, there are frame homes that don’t use timber but instead use steel studs. While steel studs are more commonly seen in commercial construction, they do add a layer of fire resistance and durability to the home to help reduce insurance costs. Some homes can also be made from prefabricated walls that use wood panels sandwiched together to create walls. These materials often result in more expensive homeowners insurance because of their flammability and potential to warp.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure about what type of building materials are used in your home, talk to your insurance representative. They can help assess the structure and make sure that you are properly insuring your home.</p>\n<p>To learn more about what goes into a home, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">5 Roof Shapes Every Homeowner Should Know.</a>\"</p>"

Let's fix that.</p>\n<p>Since Kin broke the news that our insurance company now offers <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance in Florida</a>, we noticed some confusion. Folks asked us if we could cover RVs (that's a job for auto insurance). Some people rejoiced and sent photos of their campers (sorry, friends! Those aren’t mobile homes either). Some wondered if log cabins count as mobile homes (they do not). It seems the public at large may still have some misconceptions about what a mobile home really is.</p>\n<p>So let’s clear things up once and for all.</p>\n<p>Here is your official guide to everything a mobile home is – and isn’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomesvsmanufacturedhomesanoriginstory\">Mobile homes vs. manufactured homes: An origin story</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mobile%20home%20main.jpg?width=1000&name=mobile%20home%20main.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>This is a mobile / manufactured home. Pretty cozy, right?</em></p>\n<p>The confusion over mobile homes largely stems from their origin. Prior to 1976, prefabricated, factory-built trailer homes were massed produced and marketed as mobile housing. These were like campers and travel trailers in that they could be transported and moved thanks to their trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches, but they were different in size and furnishings.</p>\n<p>But then the federal government stepped in to make sure affordable housing was safe for the American public. It passed the 1974 National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Act, followed by the 1976 HUD Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards.

    body: "<p>Florida and Louisiana have their share of natural disasters like hurricanes, and floods. Being so close to the ocean with such dynamic weather changes can also lead to another catastrophic event: a waterspout. A waterspout's potential for damage depends on the type of waterspout it is.</p>\n<p>Waterspouts are tornado-like whirlwinds of water mist and air that usually start over the ocean and can move over land.</p>\n<h2 id=\"waterspoutsdefined\">Waterspouts Defined</h2>\n<p>According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a waterspout is a “<a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/waterspout.html\">whirling column of air and water mist</a>.” They essentially look like a tornado over water, but certain waterspouts can move over land for some time. Waterspouts that move onto land can be dangerous and cause damage to both property and people.</p>\n<p>Waterspouts that hit land can be perilous because of their speed and size. While the average waterspout is 165 feet in diameter and lasts anywhere between two and 20 minutes, massive ones can exceed 330 feet in diameter and may last up to an hour. Wind speeds may exceed 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3typesofwaterspouts\">3 Types of Waterspouts</h3>\n<p>There are three types of waterspouts: fair weather, tornadic, and snowspout.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fair weather waterspouts</strong> are created from developing cumulus clouds and don’t move very much.</li>\n<li><strong>Tornadic waterspouts</strong> are associated with extreme weather, such as hurricanes and thunderstorms. They can move quite a bit and have the same characteristics as land tornadoes. If a tornadic waterspout hits land, the National Weather Service sounds a tornado warning for the local communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Snowspouts</strong> occur when a waterspout forms under the base of a snow squall. Sometimes called snow devils, snowspouts are rare and tend to be weak, though some have reached an EF1 warning level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdowaterspoutsform\">How Do Waterspouts Form?</h2>\n<p>How a waterspout forms depends on the type of waterspout it is.</p>\n<p>A fair weather waterspout occurs over open water when cool air sweeps across the surface and pulls the water up.</p>\n<p>Tornadic waterspouts are different in that they happen during thunderstorm conditions –&nbsp;some even start as tornadoes on land and move over water. Additionally, tornadic waterspouts are more likely to develop in the sky and reach down.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/apx/waterspout\">five stages of a waterspout</a> are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dark spot:</strong> A light-colored disk becomes prominent on the water’s surface. This lighter disc is surrounded by a dark area with diffused edges.</li>\n<li><strong>Spiral pattern:</strong> Light- and dark-colored bands spiral out from the dark spot.</li>\n<li><strong>Spray ring:</strong> The dark spot develops a dense swirl of sea spray, called a cascade, that looks similar to the eye of a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Mature vortex:</strong> The spray ring expands into a spinning funnel that stretches from the water to the clouds above.</li>\n<li><strong>Decay:</strong> Warm air weakens the vortex, and it begins to dissipate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key component of any waterspout is the focused cold air cycling over the warm surface water. Once the conditions are met, a waterspout could develop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafefromawaterspout\">How to Stay Safe from a Waterspout</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, the NWS issues a tornado warning when a waterspout moves on land. But you can also protect yourself and your family by paying attention to weather conditions so you can avoid waterspouts altogether. For example, if you’re out on the water you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention to special marine warnings.</li>\n<li>Look for waterspouts underneath cumulus clouds with dark, flat bases.</li>\n<li>Move in a 90 degree angle away from a waterspout’s direction if you see one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, too, that you never want to try and move through a waterspout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arewaterspoutscoveredbyhomeownersinsurance\">Are Waterspouts Covered by Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>With speeds exceeding 50 miles per hour, homeowners could see damage from a waterspout, particularly if it picks up debris and sends it into their home. Luckily, most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> (including <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>) covers waterspouts as windstorm damage. However, if a waterspout happens because of hurricane conditions, homeowners should note that policies only cover damage caused by wind. Storm surge from a hurricane is usually covered by <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to make sure your insurance can handle whatever comes your way? We’ll be happy to review your policy to see if you’ve got all your bases covered.</p>"

    body: "<p>An attractive nuisance is anything on your property that someone, usually a minor, might see as fun, but that can also cause serious injuries. Depending on the laws in your area, you can be held responsible for those injuries﹘sometimes even if the person injured was trespassing on your property. The increased risk makes understanding what an attractive nuisance is an important part of protecting your home and the individuals who come on your property.</p>\n<p>After all, you probably want to keep your pool or tree house, so you need to know how you can minimize the chance of someone getting hurt. You also have to consider how the extra risk might impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a>. In some cases, your premiums may go up. Worse? Some insurance companies don’t insure homes with certain attractive nuisances. Yours may even <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">choose not to renew your policy</a> if you add a feature it doesn’t insure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examplesofattractivenuisances\">Examples of attractive nuisances</h2>\n<p>Here are some common attractive nuisances and what makes them dangerous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swimmingpool\">Swimming pool</h3>\n<p>According to the Center of Disease Control (CDC), the US sees nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/facts/index.html\">4,000 fatal drownings every year</a>, so swimming pools and hot tubs are some of the biggest concerns for homeowners and insurance companies. Fatal drownings aren’t the only worry, either. A person can hit their head on a diving board or fall off a slide. This is why many insurance companies and city codes require fences and gates around pools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trampoline\">Trampoline</h3>\n<p>Jumping on a trampoline is a ton of fun, but it can also be risky. A study from the Academy of American Pediatrics identified over <a href=\"https://www.aappublications.org/news/2019/09/10/focus091019\">1 million trampoline-related injuries</a> in a 10-year period. A third of those injuries were broken bones. That’s not surprising once you think of all the ways someone can get hurt on a trampoline. Not only can they lose their balance or step on a spring and get hurt, but the entire contraption can flip over or malfunction. And isn’t there always at least one person who wants to do somersaults and backflips? They’re just as likely to hurt someone else as they are themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"treehouse\">Tree house</h3>\n<p>Tree houses are often ten to fifteen feet in the air, which increases the chance that a fall will cause a serious injury. The risk for injury increases if the ground below has a hard surface. Moreover, tree houses are rarely built to any sort of building code standards, so there’s seldom any weight limit. If a group of kids flock to a tree house, there’s no telling at what point the structure may collapse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"playgroundequipment\">Playground equipment</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/playground-injuries/playgroundinjuries-factsheet.htm\">Data from the CDC</a> shows that more than 200,000 children under the age of 14 visit emergency rooms for playground-related injuries, so you always need to make sure children at your home are playing on playground equipment safely. Even under the best of circumstances, kids can fall or get hurt on playground equipment. You can also reduce the likelihood of injury if you have a soft surface under your equipment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fishponds\">Fish ponds</h3>\n<p>People can drown in just a few inches of water, so something that seems relatively safe, like a fish pond, can actually present a real risk. A child might lean over to see the fish, fall in, and hit their head. Like swimming pools, it’s best to keep fish ponds behind fencing and enclosed areas to limit access to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constructionequipment\">Construction equipment</h3>\n<p>You might not think of a construction area as attractive at all, children love exploring them and playing with any tools left lying around. If you’re in the middle of a project, make sure you put away your tools and unplug power tools even if you’re only stepping away for a moment. You don’t want a child to get their hands on a plugged in nail gun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weapons\">Weapons</h3>\n<p>Children are curious about weapons, especially guns. Most will pick up a gun or other weapon if they have the chance, and it takes just one unfortunate day for disaster to strike. Any weapons in your house should be under lock and key. If you have a gun, keep it unloaded and store the ammunition in a separate location. Display guns need to be unloaded and secured to the wall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attractivenuisancesandhomeownersinsurance\">Attractive nuisances and homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance doesn’t change the risk of any attractive nuisance, but it can reduce your financial exposure. The protection is found in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> that helps to pay costs if you’re found responsible for someone else’s property damage or physical injury.</p>\n<p>Most policies have at least $100,000 in personal liability coverage. However, you may want more if you have an attractive nuisance on your property. Increasing your liability coverage usually doesn’t cause a substantial increase in your premiums, and the additional protection is often well worth the extra cost.</p>\n<p>Not every insurance company insures every attractive nuisance. Those that do, may impose safety restrictions before they’ll insure it. This might include putting a gate around your pool and removing the diving board or buying a certain type of gun safe. An underwriter may actually come out to check that you’re following these safety restrictions.</p>\n<p>You may also want to check with your insurer before you add a feature that might be considered an attractive nuisance. You’re better off finding out if your policy covers your new pool before you install it.</p>"

    body: "<p>Living in a city definitely has its allure. At the very least, being in the heart of an urban area gives you more options when it comes to entertainment, employment, and healthcare. But the trade-off is usually higher prices and smaller living spaces.</p>\n<p>But lately, people are looking to get out of cities﹘particularly now that remote work has become more common. Some got as far as the suburbs, but others made it as far as an exurb.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exurbsdefined\">Exurbs Defined</h2>\n<p>Most simply, exurbs are locations beyond a metropolitan area and its suburbs. According to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/finding-exurbia-americas-fast-growing-communities-at-the-metropolitan-fringe/\">Finding Exurbia: America’s Fastest Growing Communities at the Metropolitan Fringe</a> from the Brookings Institution, an area can be called an exurb it is has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 20 percent of its workers commuting to a nearby city.</li>\n<li>Low housing density.</li>\n<li>Population growth that exceeds that of the nearby city.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many areas, exurbs tend to be at least somewhat rural﹘ moving to one doesn't necessarily mean you own farmland, but you may see more than one neighbor <a href=\"/blog/raising-backyard-chickens/\">raising backyard chickens</a>. However, exurbs can also be small towns or villages located just beyond a city’s suburbs.</p>\n<p>Long story short? Exurbs probably won’t show up on anyone’s list for <a href=\"/blog/best-places-to-live/\">top places to live</a>, but only because they tend to be lesser known locations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exurbsvssuburbwhatsthedifference\">Exurbs vs. Suburb: What’s the Difference?</h2>\n<p>Exurbs and suburbs do share some characteristics. For example, both exurbs and suburbs have a percentage of residents who commute to jobs in a nearby city, plus lower housing density. Both also tend to be more spread out so residents often need to drive more.</p>\n<p>However, suburbs are more likely than exurbs to have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subdivisions developed by a single real estate company.</strong> These often consist of tract homes where buyers can choose from several model homes with slight variations.</li>\n<li><strong>More complex road systems.</strong> Suburban roads typically include cul-de-sacs that give way to larger residential streets that ultimately connect to even larger roads and highways.</li>\n<li><strong>Well-known stores and restaurants.</strong> Many suburbs are known for being home to malls with plenty of parking, major box big stores, and franchised restaurants.</li>\n<li><strong>Public transportation.</strong> Suburbs often have buses and commuter trains, particularly when they are closer to the city they support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exurbs, on the other hand, are farther away from cities, past the suburbs, which means they’re less likely to have many of the amenities found in the city and suburbs. For example, some exurbs may have a central business district, but the stores are usually not national chains. And not only is public transportation rare, but exurbs are usually not very walkable. You’re also less likely to see subdivisions with homes that look alike in exurbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keybenefitsofexurbs\">Key Benefits of Exurbs</h2>\n<p>Because they are even farther away from major cities, exurbs are often more affordable than suburbs. This means that homeowners can get more house for their money. Lot sizes are also bigger, and the additional space provides greater privacy than what you find in the city.</p>\n<p>Being away from the city and having more space between homes also reduces noise levels. The only sounds you may hear are birds chirping or a deer rustling in the bushes along the edge of your property.</p>\n<p>Living in an exurb can also mean less pollution. While people definitely have to drive more, there are few cars, and that reduces the amount of emissions you breathe. And with fewer people, there is almost always less trash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aretheexurbsrightforyou\">Are the Exurbs Right for You?</h2>\n<p>While a lower cost of living and a quieter lifestyle sounds great, the exurbs aren’t for everyone. The first question to answer is whether your job will allow you to telecommute at least some of the time. The willingness of some tech giants to allow remote work is one reason the exurbs of San Francisco Bay, areas like Brentwood and Petaluma, have grown recently.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to be comfortable being farther away from some basic necessities. Grocery stores and dry cleaners may be a 30-minute drive rather than just down the block. Moreover, you will likely have fewer retailers to pick from. The same may be true of cultural activities. Dinner and a show might take additional planning if you have to drive over an hour to attend.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you need to weigh what you’re willing to give up against what the exurbs have to offer. Is a bigger home and more privacy worth a longer commute or fewer nights out on the town? You’re the only one who can answer that question.</p>"

This article will equip you with the tools you need to file an insurance claim so that, when that flood strikes, you will be able to continue to equip your life with the stability and comfort your family needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howinsuranceclaimswork\">How Insurance Claims Work</h2>\n<p>An insurance claim is a reimbursement for property damage by a homeowners insurance company based on the terms of their insurance policy. Homeowners pay a monthly fee or premium to their insurance company in exchange for the assurance that the insurance company will reimburse them for <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">damage from a disaster</a>. When a disaster strikes, the homeowner files an insurance claim with their insurance company. The homeowner will need to compile a list of receipts and expenses and send that into their insurance company with their claim.</p>\n<p>An adjuster will then be assigned to inspect the damage and report back their assessment to your insurance company, which will base their approval or denial of the homeowners claim on the adjustor’s report. Of course, the first step to having recourse to a claim when disaster strikes is to prepare with the right type of policy and documentation beforehand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdifferentpoliciesimpactinsuranceclaims\">How Different Policies Impact Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Did you know there are nine different types of homeowners insurance? Whether you are renting or an owner, own a mobile home, or are part of a co-op or condo will influence what kind of insurance you choose. The region where you live should also impact this decision.</p>\n<p>HO-1: This policy protects a home against 11 disasters including: fire and lightning; windstorms and hail; explosion; riots and civil commotion; aircraft; vehicles; smoke; vandalism and malicious mischief; theft; glass that is part of the home; and volcanic eruptions.</p>\n<p>HO-2: This policy includes: damage from falling objects, water accidental overflow of plumbing, heating air-conditioning, household appliances. Everything included in HO-1 is also covered.</p>\n<p>HO-3: Is the most common policy as it is the most all-inclusive. It includes all the disasters contained in HO-1 and HO-2 and also: Overflow of freezing pipes, heating, A/C, or other household appliances, Tears, cracks, and burns in water heater, A/C. or sprinkler system, damage from electrical currents in appliances and wiring, all other perils except those specifically excluded in policy, floods, earthquakes, and sinkholes— the last three are purchased in a policy specific to that disaster.</p>\n<p>HO-5 is the most comprehensive policy and includes all disasters in HO-3 plus maximum coverage for personal belongings as well as every and all disaster not specifically excluded by the policy.</p>\n<p>When purchasing a homeowners policy it’s important to be aware of the laws in your state; Each state is different. Some states are more prone to natural disasters than others and each state is prone to a different set of natural disasters. Therefore, the laws of each state have been created to indicate whether homeowners need to have <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">protection against hurricanes</a>, floods, or earthquakes, etc. accordingly.</p>\n<p>For instance, Florida and Texas are two states that have perhaps the highest proclivity for natural disasters including hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Florida suffered the most from Hurricane Katrina—the most expensive natural disaster in American history. Meanwhile, Texas sets the record for the most natural disasters in one state at 86.</p>\n<h3 id=\"casestudiesfloridatexas\"><strong>Case Studies: Florida & Texas</strong></h3>\n<p>One caveat worth bearing in mind, is that earthquake, sinkhole and <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Florida: Hurricane Deductibles</strong></p>\n<p>Florida provides a particularly nuanced use case because the state’s government requires homeowners to insure against disaster with hurricane deductibles (<a href=\"https://www.iii.org/issue-update/background-on-hurricane-and-windstorm-deductibles\">as do 18 other states</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Texas: Windstorm & Hail</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Texas Department of Insurance web site “The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) is the state's insurer for windstorm and hail coverage. You may buy TWIA coverage through local insurance agents if you need it.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"filinganinsuranceclaim\">Filing an Insurance Claim</h2>\n<p>Now we get to the crucial part: filing the insurance claim itself. Before disaster strikes, it’s important to keep an inventory of the receipts of all your valuables, mortgage, etc. in a disaster-proof safe. Disaster strikes. Continue to record all of your activities, including:</p>\n<p>(1) Damaged items even if they are destroyed</p>\n<p>(2) The amount required for temporary housing and relocation</p>\n<p>(3) Prior receipts in your off-site / disaster proof safe</p>\n<p>(4) Any additional living expenses that arise as a result of the damage</p>\n<h3 id=\"tofileornottofileaninsuranceclaim\">To File or Not to File an Insurance Claim?</h3>\n<p>Believe it or not, sometimes it’s good not to file an insurance claim. If the cost of the claim is bigger than the deductible, it is almost never worth it. This may result in a significant hike in your premiums. This is especially true if you file more than one claim a year. Insurance claims are for large disasters after all, and typically aren’t worth the hike in premium otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtofileahomeownersinsuranceclaim\">How to File a Homeowners Insurance Claim</h3>\n<p><strong>Dos</strong>\nPlan in advance\nKeep a record of all valuables with serial numbers in a fireproof safe\nFile your claim within 60 days\nContact your mortgage lender\nBe aware that your mortgage fees will be deducted from your payout\nKeep receipts from repairs &amp; lodging\nBe aware of state laws affecting insurance premiums\nHire a public adjustor</p>\n<p><strong>Don'ts</strong>\nWait too long\nDispose of damaged items\nFile with an unreliable policy</p>"

    body: "<p>FEMA is designed to help survivors rebuild their lives after a natural disaster. But it's not a substitute for homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisfema\">What Is FEMA?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/\">FEMA</a> (Federal Emergency Management Agency) became a household name after Hurricane Katrina when the agency came under media scrutiny for its failure to respond to victims in a timely fashion. Hurricane Katrina is notorious for being one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in modern US history, with 1,833 lives lost and more than $108 billion in damage. FEMA was unprepared for Katrina.</p>\n<p>FEMA was formed under an executive order signed by President Jimmy Carter on April 1st, 1979, with the mission to “lead America to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">disasters</a> with a vision of 'A Nation Prepared.'\" FEMA was designed to be a governmental agency to provide assistance to all disasters, natural and manmade, by coordinating response efforts from federal, state and local agencies.</p>\n<p>FEMA remained pretty obscure for the first two decades of its tenure. It wasn’t until events like September 11th, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy that the agency's shortcomings became apparent. In the years since the disasters, the federal government has made several upgrades to FEMA, such as making part of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. Yet the most significant change came when President George W. Bush signed into law the “Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act” in 2006, giving FEMA more authority and better access to resources. This acknowledged the agency's failures and provided measures to better prepare for another disaster of Katrina's magnitude.</p>\n<p>After its lackluster response to Katrina, FEMA became known for its role in hurricane relief efforts. But, FEMA does much more than that. If there’s a wildfire, earthquake, terror attack, tornado, landslide, civil defense or any other disaster, FEMA is dispatched to the scene. There are 10 regional FEMA offices throughout the country, which offer coverage for the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and other US territories (though FEMA's track record in these territories has been questionable at best).</p>\n<h2 id=\"sohowdoesfemawork\">So How Does FEMA Work?</h2>\n<p>The President of the United States is the sole party capable of declaring an emergency or major disaster. Furthermore, only the governor of the state requesting disaster declaration has the authority to call upon the President to do so. When such a declaration occurs, it gives FEMA the green light to take charge by means of financially and physically controlling the situation. It is then FEMA’s responsibility to act as a liaison between the federal government and the region in question. Its role typically involves distributing supplies, managing resources, and executing a strategic plan that involves working intricately with state and local officials.</p>\n<p>FEMA is essentially the “boots on the ground” when there’s a disaster. It mobilizes the appropriate troops and coordinates the necessary response. Depending on the disaster at hand, that might mean: working with local law enforcement on evacuation procedures, providing tarps as temporary roofs for <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane-damaged homes</a>, providing and seeking housing for folks displaced by a natural disaster, coordinating food distribution and allocation efforts or ensuring adequate medical teams are dispersed at the scenes.</p>\n<p>FEMA has a difficult role to play. The best advice is to prepare your home and your family in the best possible way, especially if you live in a climatically volatile region of the US. This typically includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heed local evacuation warnings. This sounds simple but many people insist on “waiting it out.” As <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/houston/\">Houston</a> learned with Hurricane Harvey, <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flooding can be especially unpredictable</a>.</li>\n<li>If you live in a coastal area, like <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/miami/\">Miami</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa</a>, prone to hurricanes, get appropriate <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">wind mitigations</a> on your home.</li>\n<li>If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, make sure to regularly practice safety drills, taking care to make sure small children know what to do.</li>\n<li>If tornados are known to creep in your area, have your practice drills down know where to go.</li>\n<li>In anticipation of storm season, have extra food and supplies already in your home. At the end of the season, toss what's expired and replenish your supply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By preparing yourself and your family, you improve the odds that you'll be in a better position when disaster strikes, so that even if you have to wait for FEMA to arrive on the scene, you'll be able to weather the storm.</p>"

    body: "<p>If you have a mortgage, chances are you know you're supposed to have hazard insurance. But what is it and how does it differ from home insurance? Find out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hazardinsurancevshomeownersinsurance\">Hazard Insurance vs Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you took on a mortgage loan to buy your home, chances are your lender required you to carry “hazard insurance.” If you already have homeowners insurance, rest assured: hazard insurance is almost certainly included. Either way, here’s a breakdown of what home hazard insurance is and why you need to have it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hazardinsurancecoverageforthestructureofyourhome\">Hazard Insurance: Coverage for the Structure of Your Home</h2>\n<p>Essentially, hazard insurance (also sometimes called “<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>”) is coverage that protects only the structure of your home: bricks, shingles, window panes, doors. The house itself.</p>\n<p>Mortgage companies want you to have this coverage because they’re financially invested in the structure: they’ve fronted you the money to purchase this house. Until you’ve paid off the loan, the house itself is the mortgage lender’s biggest bargaining chip: if you stop making payments, for example, they can foreclose on it and resell the property to recover some of their loss.</p>\n<p>If a fire burns the house down, the insurance ensures that it will be rebuilt – and you won’t just walk away from whatever debt remains on the loan. In other words, it’s in the mortgage lender’s best interest to make sure there’s a plan for fixing anything that goes wrong with the house.</p>\n<p>Typical hazard insurance offers protection for damage to your home caused by events (also called “perils”) such as…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning.</li>\n<li>Fire.</li>\n<li>Theft and vandalism.</li>\n<li>Hail.</li>\n<li>Falling objects.</li>\n<li>Wind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most hazard insurance policies (and most standard homeowners insurance policies, for that matter) do NOT offer coverage for damage caused by…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mudslides.</li>\n<li>Landslides.</li>\n<li>Sinkholes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Floods</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whathazardinsurancedoesntcover\">What Hazard Insurance Doesn’t Cover</h2>\n<p>Besides excluding structural damage from certain types of events, hazard insurance also doesn’t offer coverage for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, including anything that can be picked up and moved around inside your house. This is protected by contents coverage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expenses</a> if a guest is hurt in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability</a> expenses if a hurt guest sues you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use</a> of your home (when you need to stay in a hotel because your home is temporarily unlivable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The good news: a standard homeowners policy includes not only hazard insurance but also everything listed above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancehazardinsurancemuchmore\">Homeowners Insurance = Hazard Insurance + Much More</h2>\n<p>Chances are, if you’re buying a home, you’re planning to get insurance regardless of what the mortgage company requires you to do. And even if you’re paying cash for your home, hazard insurance makes sense. It’s just plain smart to protect the single biggest purchase you’ve ever made.</p>\n<p>The bottom line about hazard insurance is that you don’t have to shop for it separately from your regular homeowners insurance. It’s standard practice for insurance companies to include it in a homeowners policy (after all, it wouldn’t be much of a policy if it didn’t protect the home itself). In some policies, you’ll see it referred to as dwelling insurance, but no matter the name, it offers the same protection: coverage for the physical structure of your house.</p>\n<p>Ready to find out how much you’ll play for a homeowners policy that includes hazard insurance, contents coverage, personal liability, and more? <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote</a> in two minutes or less.

    body: "<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancefornewhomeowners\">Homeowners Insurance for New Homeowners</h2>\n<p>New homeowners have a lot on their plate. Applying for a mortgage, planning the big move, house prep, and other items can eat up a lot of time.</p>\n<p>For many homeowners, insurance is just another box on their to-do list. Yet, a lack of understanding of what’s in their policy can lead to significant consequences down the road. The policy may not cover what they thought, or may not cover enough of the costs.</p>\n<p>That’s why we have created this beginner’s guide to provide new homeowners with everything you need to know. After reading this guide you’ll be able to answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does my homeowners insurance cover?</li>\n<li>How are my premiums and deductibles related?</li>\n<li>What are special limits?</li>\n<li>How can I make sure my new home is properly covered?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatishomeownersinsurance\">What Is Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, homeowners insurance is a policy taken out by a homeowner that protects their home and property in the event of an accident or event referred to as a <strong>peril</strong>. You can use homeowners insurance for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repairing your home and other structures on your property following a peril.</li>\n<li>Repair and replace personal property that was destroyed during an event.</li>\n<li>Cover personal liability costs, such as legal fees or medical bills, if someone is injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though not required by law, homeowners insurance is required by most mortgage lenders (after all, they want to protect their investment!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsincludedinmypolicy\">What’s Included in My Policy?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance policies are actually made up of several different types of coverage related to property, possessions, and liability. Most include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling Coverage</a> (Coverage A): Coverage related to repairing or rebuilding your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other Structures Insurance</a> (Coverage B): Coverage related to repairing or rebuilding additional structures on your property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal Property Coverage</a> (Coverage C ): Coverage related to your personal belongings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use Insurance</a> (Coverage D ): Coverage related to expenses incurred while you’re displaced from your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability Insurance</a> (Coverage E): Coverage related to legal and medical expenses due to accidents occurring on your property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments Insurance</a> (Coverage F): Coverage related to smaller medical expenses due to accidents occurring on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners also have the option to add additional coverage to their policy. Some common options coverages homeowners choose include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water Backup Coverage: Covers damage related to pipe bursts and other plumbing issues.</li>\n<li>Enhanced Dwelling Protection: Additional coverage (i.e. raised limit) for your home’s main structure (Coverage A).</li>\n<li>Identity Theft Expense Coverage: Covers expenses related to identity theft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement: Covers high-value and rare items (e.g. art, jewelry), that would exceed your Personal Property Coverage limit</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Homeowners insurance policies are actually made up of several different types of coverage related to property, possessions, and liability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mypolicydoesntcoverthat\">My Policy Doesn’t Cover That?</h2>\n<p>There are several perils that aren’t covered by standard homeowners insurance policies. For example, earthquakes and <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> both require separate policies. Homeowners also need to be aware that each state has its own insurance regulations, so make sure that you're staying on the right side of the law. Keep in mind that legally required coverage is typically the bare minimum - for example, you may want to look into a flood policy if your neighborhood has a history of flooding, even if you're not in a FEMA flood zone.</p>\n<p>Review the declaration page of your policy. Even though most providers use standard forms for their policies, there can be major differences that could affect your coverage. In addition to listing your coverage types and limits, the declaration page will also include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Policy information (number, period of coverage)</li>\n<li>Policyholder’s information</li>\n<li>Address of insured property</li>\n<li>Discounts and premium amount</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdoestheclaimsprocesswork\">How Does the Claims Process Work?</h2>\n<p>Claims payments…the whole point of having home insurance. Unfortunately, this process is also known for causing headaches for homeowners who just want to move on from the event or accident that triggered the claim.</p>\n<p>Companies first require homeowners to provide them a proof of loss, which is a document that explains why the claim is being filed. The proof of loss document typically includes information such as date the loss occurred, the cause of the loss, and its value.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to provide proof of the value of the loss items and property, such as original receipts and home inventory documents. For home damage, estimates and appraisals may be necessary.</p>\n<p>Proof of loss forms usually need to be filed within a specified time frame, such as 60 days, from when the loss event occurred. Companies may also require that the proof of loss be notarized. Notaries can be found at banks and courthouses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Actual cash value takes depreciation into account, meaning that in a disaster your payment likely won’t cover the cost to replace your house</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"actualcashvaluevsreplacementcost\">Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost</h2>\n<p>If your company accepts the claim, payment will be completed based on the “basis of claims settlement” listed in the policy. Payment is typically calculated in one of two ways: actual cash value or replacement cost.</p>\n<p>Actual cash value payments are calculated using the present value of your home or property. In other words, actual cash value takes depreciation into account, meaning that in a disaster your payment likely won’t cover replacement costs. In contrast, replacement cost payments will pay out the cost to replace your possessions or the materials to repair your home.</p>\n<p>Policies with replacement cost payments tend to have higher premiums than those with actual cash value payments. However, homeowners may decide the higher premiums are worth greater flexibility if a claim needs to be filed.</p>\n<p>The <strong>insurance-to-value ratio</strong> can be used to understand if your home is properly covered. This shows the amount of insurance you’ve purchased to the replacement value of your property. Most home insurance policies require that your property is insured to a minimum of 80 percent of the replacement cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arethereanycaveatstohomeownersinsurance\">Are There Any Caveats to Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Yes. Pricing is only part of the puzzle when buying homeowners insurance. You must understand the everything about the policy, including the phrasing of coverages. Otherwise, you could be stuck paying for things you thought were covered.</p>\n<p>Some clauses and phrases to look out for include:</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordinanceorlawexclusions\">Ordinance or Law Exclusions</h3>\n<p>Building codes are always changing and may include a switch to safer (and likely more expensive) building materials moving forward. Ordinance or Law Exclusions mean your policy won’t cover the increase in costs for these code upgrades. This may also be true for replacement cost policies, where only the value for the original materials will be covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"speciallimitsandlimiteditems\">Special Limits and Limited Items</h3>\n<p>Homeowners insurance policies are only meant to cover basic personal possessions, not high-end items like art and jewelry. Because of this, policies set limits to coverage for these items. Be sure to review your policy to understand the limits on high-value items including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firearms</li>\n<li>Monetary items like gold, silver, and banknotes</li>\n<li>Loss by theft of furs, jewelry, precious and semiprecious stones, and watches</li>\n<li>Loss by theft of silver and gold-plated items</li>\n<li>Property used for business purposes</li>\n<li>Trailers</li>\n<li>Watercraft</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsuranceawiseinvestment\">Homeowners Insurance: A Wise Investment</h2>\n<p>Your home is likely one the most valuable investments you’ll ever have. Protecting it with the right home insurance policy is a must. Before purchasing a home insurance policy, make sure you understand everything that’s included. Which events are covered under my policy? What special limits are there?</p>\n<p>Every homeowner is different and will have different coverage needs. The right insurance company will have agents and a support team to answer all your questions and recommend the right policy for you. The right insurance company should be just as invested in your home as you are.</p>"

These contracts cover damage from regular use and age, which is one reason homeowners find them so attractive, especially if they are new buyers or are purchasing an older home.</p>\n<p>Another benefit for homeowners is the simplicity of a home warranty. When their dishwasher breaks down, they only have to make one phone call.

It kicks in when someone is injured at your house or when you damage someone’s property.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your appliances are your personal property, and your home insurance can help pay to replace them when covered events damage them, like a fire or windstorm. However, it won’t cover their replacement when they simply won’t work or malfunction. For that, you’d need a home warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedshomewarrantyinsurance\">Who Needs Home Warranty Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Home warranty insurance may not offer the same protections a homeowners policy does, but you may still want to investigate the option if you’re:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A first-time buyer with no home maintenance experience.</li>\n<li>Buying an older house or a house with older appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chances are you won’t have to look far for a home warranty company, but pick a reputable one to avoid potential scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Research the company.</strong> Read reviews and look the company up on the Better Business Bureau or state’s department of insurance before you commit to a yearlong service agreement.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the warranty.</strong> Your plan can exclude certain components, require you to use certain repair companies, or deny payment for unusual wear and tear.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the company’s address.</strong> A P.O. box or other types of short-term rental space doesn’t necessarily mean a company isn’t reputable, but it can be a warning sign that it isn’t going to be around when trouble hits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customer reviews are also a useful way to assess a company’s credibility. Look them up on Yelp or Trustpilot to get an impression of fellow homeowners’ experiences.</p>"

    body: "<p>You can do a lot of things to make your home more desirable to buyers when you put it on the market, like decluttering and removing personal items. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you need to fix every little thing before you can sell your house. Some improvements simply aren’t worth the money or effort. Here’s our list of what not to fix when selling a house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1dontmakemajorcosmeticrenovations\">1. Don’t make major cosmetic renovations</h2>\n<p>Everyone oohs and aahs when they see a freshly renovated kitchen, but the return is seldom one to one. In fact, realtors estimate that homeowners recover about <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/2019-remodeling-impact-10-03-2019.pdf\">60 percent</a> of what you spend, and that doesn’t take into consideration the stress that comes with remodeling on a tight deadline. Plus, only 10 percent of realtors said kitchen renovations helped close a sale.</p>\n<p>Certain renovations may be appropriate﹘even necessary﹘for your home or in your market, but you can’t assume they are. In some cases, you may be better off listing your home just under the competition and saving yourself the work. A local agent can help you figure if any improvements will have an impact on your sale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2dontoverhaulyourlandscaping\">2. Don’t overhaul your landscaping</h2>\n<p>Real estate agents often emphasize the importance of curb appeal when selling a home, so you may be tempted to give your yard a major makeover. However, a complete tear out and remodel costs between <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/landscape/\">$10 - $40 per square foot</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of money to spend on a good first impression, especially when there are many <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">easy ways to boost your home’s curb appeal</a>. Trimming trees and bushes, cleaning up dead leaves, and mowing the grass are all good places to start. After that, head to your local garden store for colorful plants to add some pop to the walkway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3dontembracethelatesttrends\">3. Don’t embrace the latest trends</h2>\n<p>Trends come and go, so <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">what’s cool now</a> can seem dated in a heartbeat. More importantly, you want the people who come to your showings to be able to see themselves in your home. Super trendy decor can make that difficult for them. Give potential buyers a mostly blank slate and they’ll start imaging what they can do with your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4dontaddquirkyfeatures\">4. Don’t add quirky features</h2>\n<p>When you own a home, you can design it however you see fit. Your options are really only limited by your imagination and budget. But when it comes time to sell, every off-the-wall decor feature can distract potential buyers from your home’s value. For example, you may think a urinal in the master bath is a great space saver or the pink tile on your kitchen cabinets is fun and easy to care for, buyers are calculating what it might cost to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5dontreplaceworkingappliances\">5. Don’t replace working appliances</h2>\n<p>Brand new appliances are a nice bonus when buying a home, but older models are seldom a deal breaker if they’re working. Moreover, new appliances won’t have much impact on your <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">home appraisal</a>. Instead, give the appliances you have a good cleaning.</p>\n<p>Broken appliances, however, are a horse of a different color. Those may need to be replaced, particularly those in the kitchen. However, brand new refrigerators, dishwashers, and ovens can be pricey, so consider replacing them with used or floor models.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6dontreplaceyourroof\">6. Don’t replace your roof</h2>\n<p>The roof is one of the most important aspects of any home, so you want to replace yours when it shows <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">signs of age</a>. However, you aren’t required to replace your roof when you put your house up for sale.</p>\n<p>You are, however, required to disclose leaks and prior damage in most states, so it’s best to be upfront about any issues. This may mean you have to make minor repairs or even discount the cost of a new roof to close the deal, but that’s definitely better than being sued down the road. But in a seller’s market, buyers may be more willing to deal with a less-than-perfect roof in order to buy in the area they want.</p>\n<p>Knowing what not to fix when selling a house isn’t always clear cut. Market conditions can have a major influence on how homebuyers react to what you’re offering, which is why it’s important to work with a licensed professional. A local agent deals with the real estate market every day and can help you decide what repairs are truly necessary.</p>"

    body: "<p>Welcome to National Hurricane Preparedness Week!</p>\n<p>Every year, National Hurricane Preparedness Week gives people the chance to share information about hurricane risk. Our contribution this year is to let you know what’s in store hurricane season 2022. That’s knowledge you can use to identify your risk and better protect your home and family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneseason2022overview\">Hurricane Season 2022: Overview</h2>\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html\">extended range estimate</a> from the Colorado State University (CSU) Tropical Meteorology Project came out on April 7, 2022, and it predicted above-normal activity for the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season in the form of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>19 named storms.</li>\n<li>9 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scientists at CSU say that a shift from the current La Niña cycle to an El Niño is unlikely. El Niño cycles often produce below-normal hurricane seasons.These predictions are an increase from the <a href=\"https://resilience.iii.org/resilience-blog/hurricanes/initial-estimate-for-2022-atlantic-hurricane-season-above-average-again\">project’s earlier projection</a> of 13 to 16 named storms and six to eight hurricanes. CSU plans to issue updates on June 2, July 7, and August 4.</p>\n<p><strong>August 4, 2022 - UPDATE -</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released an <a href=\"https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.shtml\">updated forecast for hurricane season 2022</a>, now predicting a 60 percent chance for above-normal activity. NOAA also predicts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>14 to 20 named storms.</li>\n<li>6 to 10 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>3 to 5 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CSU Tropical Meteorology Project also updated its predictions on August 4 and is now forecasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>18 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both organizations say these numbers still represent an above-normal hurricane season for 2022 and encourage people to be prepared for storms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoeshurricaneseason2022comparetolastyear\">How Does Hurricane Season 2022 Compare to Last Year?</h3>\n<p>At the start of the 2021 season, the CSU team <a href=\"https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2021/11/30/csu-researchers-correctly-predicted-above-average-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season\">correctly predicted above-average hurricane activity</a>, anticipating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>17 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team increased its projections in subsequent updates to 18 named storms. In the end, the season ended with 21 named storms and seven hurricanes, with four falling into the major hurricane category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morehurricanesforthenorthernus\">More Hurricanes for the Northern US?</h2>\n<p>Another interesting statistic from CSU’s Tropical Meteorology Project: Just 40 years ago, only 12 percent of hurricanes, tropical storms, and tropical depressions hit these states. Now about 16 percent are expected to make landfall in the northern US each year.</p>\n<p>The statistic appears to jibe with a recent study published in Nature Geoscience that predicts <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00859-1\">more storms</a> will reach midlatitude regions, or areas located between 30° and 60° latitude. This means cities that don’t often see named storms, like New York, Boston, and Baltimore, may need to prepare for hurricanes in 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricanesandclimatechange\">Hurricanes and Climate Change</h2>\n<p>We may be in for another above-average hurricane season in 2022, but according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), scientists haven’t connected the dots between the number of <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\">hurricanes and climate change</a>. But the data does suggest that we are in for more intense hurricanes because sea levels and surface temperatures are rising.</p>\n<p>Climate change, however, might be the reason more cities outside of the traditional hurricane zone may suffer through more storms. According to C2ES, hurricanes’ migration towards both poles may be the result of rising global temperatures. Plus, the lead author of the Nature Geoscience study stated in a <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2022/01/03/future-hurricanes-will-roam-over-more-earth-study-predicts\">press release</a> that this shift as “an important, under-estimated risk of climate change.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforhurricaneseason2022\">How to Prepare for Hurricane Season 2022</h2>\n<p>The key to preparing for any potential problem is knowing your chance of experiencing a hurricane. This may be even more important now as more cities appear to have increased hurricane risk.</p>\n<p>Once you understand if you’re likely to see a hurricane, you can develop a plan to help you weather the storm. For example, you want to prepare a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">hurricane plan</a> that includes steps like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drawing up an evacuation route.</li>\n<li>Putting together an evacuation kit.</li>\n<li>Purchasing essential supplies if you need to shelter in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also want to think about ways you can make your home more resilient, such as buying <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> or trimming tree branches. Josh Skolnick of <a href=\"https://mightydogroofing.com\">Mighty Dog Roofing</a> recommends taking the time to “regularly check and maintain your roof as a preemptive measure.” Doing this can minimize your chances of suffering water damage.</p>\n<p>Another part of your hurricane preparedness plan is to review your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> to make sure you have the coverage you need. Home insurance, for example, often covers damage caused by hurricane winds, but water damage from an external source is usually excluded. This may mean you need <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> as well.</p>"

    body: "<p>There’s no question that floods are becoming more common and that they bring dangerous conditions and costly damage. Knowing what to do before the waters rise, when the flood is actually happening, and after everything is over is key to making sure your home and family are safe. If you live somewhere expecting a flood, here’s what you need to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforaflood\">How to Prepare for a Flood</h2>\n<p>Preparation is critical in any natural disaster. Often the steps you need to take come long before authorities issue any sort of warning. These include making a plan, protecting your home, creating an emergency kit, and getting flood insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1makeanemergencyplan\">1. Make an Emergency Plan</h3>\n<p>In the event of an evacuation, you want to know where you will go and how you will get there. This means <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">creating an emergency plan</a>, and most importantly, sharing it with everyone in the family. Your emergency plan should address issues that may come up if you’re ordered to evacuate, such as where your family will meet if you’re not together during the evacuation.</p>\n<p>You may want to designate someone outside of your area to who you can check in with to let people know you are safe and don’t need assistance. This person can also help your family reconnect if you get separated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2prepareyourhome\">2. Prepare Your Home</h3>\n<p>In addition to making a plan, you can prepare your home so it has minimal damage after a flood. New homes built on a floodplain should be elevated to avoid water saturation. But if your home is already built, you can elevate utilities such as the furnace, water heater, and electric panel. You can also hire a plumber to install check valves that allow water to keep sewer water from backing up into your house.</p>\n<p>Before a flood occurs, you might also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy sandbags or other home barriers and store in your garage.</li>\n<li>Install a water alarm.</li>\n<li>Get a battery-operated backup sump pump.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a flood is imminent, you may also want to move your furniture and other valuables to a higher floor. Getting these items into your attic may minimize your overall damage. That said, only take these measures if you can do so safely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3buildanemergencykit\">3. Build an Emergency Kit</h3>\n<p>For floods, the first step is to put together an emergency kit. This is a grab-and-go bag rather than a shelter-in-place kit because of the chance that you may need to evacuate quickly.</p>\n<p>A basic grab-and-go kit should have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready-to-eat, non-perishable food.</li>\n<li>Water.</li>\n<li>A battery-powered radio.</li>\n<li>A flashlight.</li>\n<li>Extra batteries.</li>\n<li>First aid kit.</li>\n<li>Personal medications.</li>\n<li>Emergency blanket.</li>\n<li>Whistle.</li>\n<li>Toothbrush, toothpaste, and other toiletries.</li>\n<li>Cash in small bills.</li>\n<li>Copy of important documents.</li>\n<li>N95 masks.</li>\n<li>Your emergency plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A shelter-in-place kit is fairly similar. The main difference is an emergency kit that stays in your home may have some additional items, like more water and seasonal clothes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4getfloodinsurance\">4. Get Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>There’s no question that floods are becoming more common or that they bring dangerous conditions and costly damage. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), even an inch of water can lead to <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/calculator\">$25,000 worth of flood damage</a>.</p>\n<p>While just about every homeowner has some <a href=\"/blog/flood-risk-management/\">flood risk</a>, standard homeowners policies don’t cover it, and that makes <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> critical. Don’t get caught <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">underinsured</a>. Talk to us about your flood risk. We offer a flood insurance endorsement for as little as $175 per year so you can be fully protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafeduringaflood\">How to Stay Safe During a Flood</h2>\n<p>Emergency broadcast systems have gotten very good about making sure people have time to evacuate. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t end up in a situation where you have to make quick decisions to protect your home and your family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1protectyourhome\">1. Protect Your Home</h3>\n<p>If authorities have issued a flood warning, you can start protecting your home with barriers. Put sandbags where water might seep in, such as doors (particularly sliding glass doors) and garages. You may also want to put your belongings on top of counters or move them to upper floors. Also, bring outdoor furniture into the house so it doesn’t get swept away in the flood.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2protectyourfamily\">2. Protect Your Family</h3>\n<p>The most important thing here is to stay informed by listening to weather alerts on the news and to locate your emergency kit so you’re prepared to evacuate. If you are given an evacuation order, turn off the gas and electricity, grab your emergency kit, and leave.</p>\n<p>Follow directions from the authorities as you evacuate, and do your best to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid walking, swimming, or driving through floodwaters.</li>\n<li>Avoid bridges over fast-moving water.</li>\n<li>Stay in your car; only get on the roof if water is rapidly rising within it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you haven’t been ordered to evacuate, pay attention to the water sources around you, such as streams that can overflow with little warning. Flash floods happen quickly and don’t need rain clouds or heavy rain in the area of flooding – meaning they don’t always announce themselves ahead of time.</p>\n<p>If water is already in your home, avoid touching electrical equipment as this can lead to electrocution. Should you find yourself surrounded by several feet of moving water, make your way to a higher floor as quickly and carefully as possible. Do not, however, go into your attic if there is no way out, and only go to the roof if you have no other choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafeafteraflood\">How to Stay Safe After a Flood</h2>\n<p>There are still dangers after the flood has receded. As much as possible, stay out of pools of water and mud. These may look safe, but water can be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. It can also be full of bacteria, and that can lead to serious health issues. Plus, moving water as shallow as six inches can sweep you off of your feet.</p>\n<p>Six inches of water can also cause you to lose control of your car, and two feet can carry away most sport utility vehicles, so don’t drive through deep pools of water. You should also know that floods erode roadways and bridges, and this may cause them to collapse under the weight of a car.</p>\n<p>Better yet? Stay off the streets as much as possible because disaster crews and emergency responders have to deal with the aftermath of the flood. If you must drive, keep to the middle of the road, the highest part, and follow all emergency signs.</p>\n<p>Emergency authorities also recommend staying out of buildings that are surrounded by water because they can be dangerous. You don’t know what the water has done to the foundation and the building may collapse. It’s best to wait until the water subsides before re-entering.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, continue to listen to emergency alerts in case more flooding is on the way. Do not return to your home until for the authorities to tell you it is safe to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleaningupaftertheflood\">Cleaning Up After the Flood</h2>\n<p>Experts recommend waiting for the water to go down before reentering your home. Once you can enter your home safely, make sure you have rubber boots, waterproof gloves, and an N95 mask to protect yourself. You should also turn off the electricity in your home if you weren’t able to prior to evacuating. But remember, don’t touch electric appliances if they are wet or if you’re standing in water.</p>\n<p>Other important clean-up steps include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checking for gas and water leaks:</strong> You’ll want to address these before anything else to prevent further damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Drying out your house:</strong> Your goal is to dry out your home within 24 hours to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prevent-mold-after-a-flood/\">prevent mold growth</a> and to limit damage to walls, floors, and foundations. If there’s oil on the water, hire an environmental contractor to remove it before you pump out the water.</li>\n<li><strong>Disinfecting your belongings: Remember that the water is likely contaminated so you need to sanitize any items you decide to keep.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is also a good time to take pictures of the damage and contact your insurer to begin the claims process. They’ll send an insurance adjuster to assess your claim, but be patient as there may be many people needing help.</p>\n<p>Devastating floods can happen in an instant, leaving you little time to get out safely. Preparation is the key to surviving while also minimizing damage to your property.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out “<a href=\"/blog/5-things-to-do-after-a-flood/\">5 Things to Do After a Flood</a>.”</p>"

    body: "<p>When hurricanes or wildfires strike, your state may call for a mandatory evacuation to save lives and keep rescue workers out of harm’s way trying to rescue those who decided to stay behind.</p>\n<p>While evacuation orders are fairly common during natural <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">disasters</a>, they can cause a lot of confusion. What are your obligations? And what are your rights during a mandatory evacuation order?</p>\n<p>Let’s get some answers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisamandatoryevacuation\">What Is A Mandatory Evacuation?</h2>\n<p>A mandatory evacuation is civil order from your city or county meant to proactively save lives during a natural disaster or emergency. During a mandatory evacuation, first responders go to each neighborhood to help residents get to safety. Once an area is cleared, first responders are less likely to risk their own lives to save someone who is in the evacuation zone.</p>\n<p>Even with mandatory evacuations in place, not everyone leaves. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.robertreeveslaw.com/blog/mandatory-evacuation/\">study by the Journal of Transportation Engineering</a> found mandatory evacuations only increased clearing folks out by six percent. That’s not much.</p>\n<p>Still, officials have to make it clear that if you stay behind, you do so at your own risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whysomefolksdontevacuate\">Why Some Folks Don’t Evacuate</h2>\n<p>The decision to leave home during an emergency is not an easy one, and for some folks, it’s simply not accessible. For example, someone might not evacuate because they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have disabilities and don’t have assistance.</li>\n<li>Didn’t hear the warnings.</li>\n<li>Refuse to leave their pets.</li>\n<li>Feel staying will help mitigate losses of the family home and belongings.</li>\n<li>Don’t have a place to go or money for a hotel.</li>\n<li>Survived previous similar disasters.</li>\n<li>Worry it's too late to leave and they’ll be stuck in a gridlock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these reasons are valid, it’s important to get to safety if you can. And be sure to <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">prepare for an emergency so you can safely take pets with you</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendomandatoryevacuationshappen\">When Do Mandatory Evacuations Happen?</h2>\n<p>Widespread disasters, like hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, and floods, may trigger a mandatory evacuation order. Mandatory evacuation laws vary by state and not every evacuation is mandatory. There are two types of evacuations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Voluntary evacuation.</strong> As it sounds, this is a suggestion to get out of the area. These usually happen when a threat is likely but not imminent. By calling for voluntary evacuations, officials hope to reduce gridlock and last-minute panic.</li>\n<li><strong>Mandatory evacuation.</strong> These are put in place when the danger is imminent. This may leave only hours (or less) to get your belongings and get out. By the time mandatory evacuations are called, the danger is a reality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even if you don’t voluntarily evacuate, <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare your home</a> in case a mandatory evacuation is called. You don’t want to forget anything in the rush.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howthelawaffectsyourrights\">How the Law Affects Your Rights</h2>\n<p>If you don’t clear out during a mandatory evacuation, you could face civil or criminal penalties. Remember the goal is to save lives and when you refuse to evacuate, a rescue worker may be forced to be in a dangerous situation to try to save you.</p>\n<p>In California, those who don’t follow a mandatory evacuation order could be charged with a misdemeanor penalty with up to a $1,000 fine and six months imprisonment. You can be penalized either for staying behind or for entering and staying in an evacuation zone. Anyone who willfully resists, delays, or obstructs a public officer or first responder may get a $1,000 fine and up to one year in prison.</p>\n<p>Despite all the destruction Florida has experienced in recent years, it doesn’t have any criminal penalties for those who don't obey a mandatory evacuation. But that doesn’t mean staying behind doesn’t have consequences. If there is a problem during the evacuation or storm, help likely won’t arrive quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosafelyevacuateyourhome\">How to Safely Evacuate Your Home</h2>\n<p>Preparation is everything when safely evacuating your home. Before you leave, get your house ready for the impending danger if you are safely able to. (If there’s a wildfire, get out as soon as possible.)</p>\n<p>Preparing your home may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning off the gas, water, and electric to prevent more damage if something catches fire or a pipe bursts.</li>\n<li>Boarding up your doors and windows.</li>\n<li>Clearing the yard of debris and storing or tying down patio furniture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make arrangements ahead of time so you know where you’re going. Get everyone, including pets, in the car and give yourself plenty of time to get out. Check local radio alerts to see where the least amount of traffic is. The later you decide to leave, the bigger chance that you’ll be stuck in gridlock with everyone else.</p>\n<p>Let family members know where you are and where you are heading so you are accounted for. Keep phones charged but use them as little as possible to prevent overloading the system and failed calls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emergencyevacuationchecklist\">Emergency Evacuation Checklist</h2>\n<p>If you live somewhere with a high probability of an evacuation order, plan ahead to make getting to safety as easy as possible. While stockpiling food, water, and other <a href=\"https://www.houselogic.com/finances-taxes/home-insurance/home-evacuation-checklist/\">emergency supplies</a> in your home is smart for a shelter in place scenario, but you also need items ready to go.</p>\n<p>Keep a checklist in your <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">emergency kit</a> to make sure you don’t forget anything essential during an evacuation. A thorough checklist may include sections for important documents, emergency supplies, and home preparation. Remember that emergency supplies always include preparing for your pets, too.</p>\n<p>This sample emergency evacuation checklist can help you prepare:</p>\n<p><strong>Copies of Important Documents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver’s license</li>\n<li>House deed</li>\n<li>Insurance <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a></li>\n<li>Medical records</li>\n<li>Passports</li>\n<li>Social security cards</li>\n<li>Names and phone numbers of important contacts (in case the phone dies)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">Home inventory</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grab-and-Go Kit (one for each person)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Food and water for three days</li>\n<li>Emergency poncho</li>\n<li>Emergency blanket</li>\n<li>NOAA radio with batteries, solar, or hand crank</li>\n<li>Phone charger and extra batteries</li>\n<li>Flashlight</li>\n<li>Medication for at least two weeks</li>\n<li>First aid kit</li>\n<li>Pet food and water for three days</li>\n<li>Pet carrier, leash, toys, and medication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Home Preparation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tie down yard furniture or put indoors</li>\n<li>Secure trash bins or put indoors</li>\n<li>Turn off utilities</li>\n<li>Clear yard debris and remove weak or dead branches</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/flood-risk-management/\">Sandbag home entryways</a> (if expecting hurricane or flood)</li>\n<li>Shutter windows and sliding glass doors</li>\n<li>Move valuables in the house to higher floors or place on counters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you do evacuate, make sure to lock your home to deter looters. Leave your home cautiously and safely. Know that everyone on the street is just as eager to get to their destination as you are. Be patient and know that you’ve done everything you can to prepare.</p>\n<p>While you can’t avert every disaster, you can do the work to reduce your total loss. Make sure you contact your insurance agent to confirm your coverage is in force and what your limits are.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that changing coverage or buying a new policy when there is an impending danger is unlikely. Insurance companies place moratoriums on new policies or changes during these periods. If you are unsure about your current coverage options, give us a call.</p>"

    body: "<p>Your roof says a lot about your house. It can hint at when your home was constructed, the style of the home, and its regional risks. And those details can also tell insurers an important thing: how resistant your home is to wind damage.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the details of a roof and what they mean for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whichroofshapesmitigatewinddamage\">Which roof shapes mitigate wind damage</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/rooftypes.jpg?width=894&name=rooftypes.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The most common roof shapes for homes tend to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hip.</strong> This roof has slopes on all four sides and they come together at the top to form a ridge. They are sturdy roofs that are durable in high-wind areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Gable.</strong> This is a peaked, triangular roof that allows for attic space or vaulted ceilings. They can make a roof more susceptible to collapse from high wind damage if they aren’t reinforced adequately.</li>\n<li><strong>Mansard.</strong> Also called a French roof, this is a four-sided roof with a double slope on each side that meet to form a low-pitched roof. Because of the low pitch, these aren’t ideal for homes in area that get a lot of snowfall.</li>\n<li><strong>Flat.</strong> This is a roof that has nearly no pitch and allows for extra living space, like a rooftop garden. However, they aren’t ideal for homes in areas with heavy rainfall.</li>\n<li><strong>Gambrel.</strong> Also called a barn roof, this roof has two different slopes and is often seen on Dutch Colonial and Georgian style homes. The open design of this shape isn’t ideal for homes in high-wind regions.</li>\n<li><strong>Skillion.</strong> Also called a shed roof or lean-to, this is a single, sloping roof often used to cover attachments to a home, like a porch. Again, this shape isn’t ideal for homes in hurricane-prone areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Combination.</strong> You’ll often see hip roofs with gable roof portions over dormers or a skillion over the porch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you might’ve guessed from the description, a hip roof usually nets homeowners a lower premium on their home insurance, especially if they live in high-wind areas. This shape better <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">mitigates wind damage</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the material the roof is made of and the way it’s attached to the home also play a key role in the longevity of the roof and the amount of wind damage a home experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roofmaterialandlongevity\">Roof material and longevity</h2>\n<p>What your roof is made of can determine how long it will hold up. These are some popular roofing materials and how long they typically last before they need to be replaced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asphalt roll roof: 5 to 10 years</li>\n<li>Composite shingle roof: 10 to 15 years</li>\n<li>Wood shingle roof: approximately 25 years</li>\n<li>Standing seam metal roof: 20 to 50 years</li>\n<li>Wood shake shingle roof: 35 to 40 years</li>\n<li>Clay tile roof / Spanish tile roof: 40 to 50 years (Underlayment lasts ~15 years)</li>\n<li>Slate roof: 100+ years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note, however, that roofing material is only one factor in your roof's ability to last. Installation, maintenance, and weather can all shorten your roof's life span and make it more difficult for <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer's</a> to cover. When you apply for insurance, your insurer may ask about the <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">roof surface</a> material and when it was last replaced. This gives them an idea about how much life the roof has left in it.</p>\n<p>As you might’ve guessed, newer roofs may fetch you a lower rate with some carriers. Others may simply require that your roof be under a certain age for you to qualify for coverage.</p>\n<p>Kin members with older roofs may want to add a <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">roof surfacing repayment schedule</a> endorsement to their homeowners policy. It changes their policy so their roof is covered for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> in wind and hail claims, making it eligible for continued coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secondarywaterresistancewhatsunderyourroof\">Secondary water resistance: What’s under your roof</h2>\n<p>Some roofs have a layer under the shingles or tiles to provide extra protection in case water gets past the primary barrier. This is called secondary water resistance (SWR) in the insurance and roofing world.</p>\n<p>In many cases, SWR barriers can <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">save you money on your home insurance</a>, especially if the barrier is applied with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peel & stick sheets or tape.</strong> With this application, the roof deck is sealed with a self-adhering sheet or tape. It must be applied directly to the sheathing to qualify for a discount – not over a layer of felt or other materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Closed-cell foam adhesives.</strong> In this case, the foam adhesive is sprayed under the roof deck inside the attic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howyourroofisattached\">How your roof is attached</h2>\n<p>A roof deck is the component between the trusses and joints and is the part where roof materials (shingles, etc.) are placed. It’s usually made out of steel, concrete, cement, or wood.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/roofdecking.jpg?width=1000&name=roofdecking.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The way the deck is attached to the trusses can determine how well the roof stands up to high winds. As you might’ve guessed, <strong>the</strong> <strong>more wind resistant a roof is, the lower your insurance premium will be</strong>.</p>\n<p>For insurance purposes, deck attachment usually falls into these categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>6d 6”x12\":</strong> A 6d nail is 2 inches long. This notation means each 2-inch nail is spaced 6 inches apart at the edge of the roof sheathing panels and 12 inches apart in the field. This qualifies for the lowest insurance discount.</li>\n<li><strong>8d 6\"x 12\":</strong> An 8d nail is 2.5 inches long. This category means each nail is spaced 6 inches apart only at the edge of roof sheathing panels and 12 inches apart in the field. This attachment qualifies you for the second best discount.</li>\n<li><strong>8d 6\"x 6\":</strong> An 8d nail is 2.5 inches long. This means each nail is 6 inches apart and gets the biggest insurance discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The way the roof is attached to the wall matters, too. Here are the attachment options, from the smallest discount (toe nails) to biggest discount (double wraps):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Toe nails.</strong> These are nails driven diagonally through the side of the roof truss or rafter into the top plate of the wall.</li>\n<li><strong>Clips.</strong> This is a metal connector between the truss or rafter and the wall held in place with at least three nails.</li>\n<li><strong>Single wraps.</strong> This is a metal connector that goes over the top of the truss/rafter and down the other side. It is secured with at least two nails in front and one more on the back of the wrap.</li>\n<li><strong>Double wraps.</strong> This is two separate metal connectors that go over the top of the truss or rafter and are secured to the wall on both sides. It must have at least three nails in the top of the plate on each side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find more <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">tips on making your home wind resistant</a> (and reducing your home insurance premium).</p>"

    body: "<p>One of the greatest truths about home insurance is that that coverage varies. It can vary by insurance company, by region, and even by individual policy. This is why it’s so important to know what’s in your policy. Knowing what’s covered can help you figure out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What you’re protected against</li>\n<li>Where you’re still vulnerable.</li>\n<li>What policy is right for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best way to get a handle on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> is to sit down and read your policy. Believe it or not, it’s easier than it sounds, especially if you use this article as your cheat sheet!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesmyhomeinsurancecover\">What does my home insurance cover?</h2>\n<p>The purpose of home insurance is to protect <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">the structure of your home</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures on your property</a> and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal possessions</a> against loss or damage due to a claimable event (referred to as a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>). Depending on your provider, some or all of the perils listed below may be covered by your home insurance policy. Be sure you are completely aware of exactly what is and is not included in the policy you decide to purchase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theft\">Theft</h3>\n<p>Should you be an unfortunate victim of <a href=\"/glossary/theft-insurance-definition/\">theft</a> or burglary, the damage to your home is covered by the main structure portion of your policy. The items that were stolen will be covered by the personal property cover, typically included in your home insurance policy.</p>\n<p>It is common practice for personal property to have limits regarding pay-outs therefore it’s important to ensure you are adequately covered for the amount of your personal possessions – particularly high-value items. One way to do that is through a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vandalism\">Vandalism</h3>\n<p>Your home insurance will cover damage caused to your property and/or personal belongings as a result of an act of <a href=\"/glossary/vandalism-definition/\">vandalism</a> or malicious mischief.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fireandsmoke\">Fire and smoke</h3>\n<p>In the event that your home, other structures or personal property are destroyed due to a fire or severe smoke, your home insurance policy will repair, rebuild or replace that which is damaged. Additionally, should you and your family be displaced as a result of such damage, you may qualify for reimbursement of costs associated with finding alternative accommodation, known as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>. Loss of use  coverage may be included in your homeowners insurance in some cases, or it may be an optional extra that you have to purchase with your homeowners insurance. Statistically, <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">fire claims are the most expensive</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"windstormsandhail\">Windstorms and hail</h3>\n<p>Damage caused as a result of windstorms and hail is typically covered. Should water or snow enter your property as a result of hail or windstorm damage, such loss or damage will also be covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightning\">Lightning</h3>\n<p>Damage caused by lightning strikes is covered. Some insurance providers may extend this coverage to power surges as a result of lightning which may damage electronic items for example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"waterdamage\">Water damage</h3>\n<p>Sudden and accidental damage caused by burst pipes or water heaters will be covered by most home insurance policies. It’s worth noting that damage caused due to wear and tear, unresolved maintenance issues or defects is not covered. Furthermore, damage as a result of water overflow from a sump pump or water backup from sewers or drains usually requires additional optional coverage. Damage due to floods also requires a separate <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fallingobjects\">Falling objects</h3>\n<p>In the rare event that your home is damaged by falling objects, for example a tree, it will be protected by your home insurance coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"explosionsandriots\">Explosions and riots</h3>\n<p>Loss or damage caused by an explosion or a riot, for example from an aerosol can or a propane grill, may be covered by your home insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"damagebyavehicleoraircraft\">Damage by a vehicle or aircraft</h3>\n<p>Whilst it may seem unlikely, it’s not impossible that your home and possessions could be damaged by a vehicle or aircraft crashing into it. Should this occur, most home insurance providers protect you against such loss or damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weightoficesnowandsleet\">Weight of ice, snow and sleet</h3>\n<p>Should your roof collapse due to heavy ice, snow or sleet your home insurance will typically cover you for the damage to your home and Personal Property within your home.</p>\n<p>The type of perils covered by a standard home insurance policy is broad and policies are not designed as one-size-fits-all. It is recommended that you speak to your insurance provider to understand those situations where cover is not provided, such as damage from earthquakes and floods.

    body: "<p>Additional living expenses coverage, sometimes called loss of use coverage, is offered under Coverage D in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policy. It can help pay for out-of-pocket costs like a hotel, excess transportation, and more when you can't live at home because of a covered claim.</p>\n<p>But when exactly does that coverage kick in? Does your home have to be totally destroyed for your insurance company to pay for additional living expenses? What if an event in your neighborhood forces a mandatory evacuation? Let’s look at a few additional living expenses examples to get a better idea of how this coverage works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additionallivingexpensesexamples\">Additional Living Expenses Examples</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Coverage D</a> typically only kicks in when your home is made uninhabitable by a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> that’s covered by your home insurance policy. That said, there are numerous examples of when you might tap into your additional living expenses coverage, including when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You need to find temporary lodging during a claim:</strong> Let’s say a kitchen fire gets out of control. As a result, your home is unsafe to live in. Most insurance companies would cover the additional living expense of temporary housing.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re unable to use part of your home:</strong> Now imagine that kitchen fire only requires your kitchen to be gutted and rebuilt. You can stay in the house, but you can’t cook there until the kitchen is redone. In this case, you may be able to file a claim to cover the costs of eating out.</li>\n<li><strong>Civil authority requires you to evacuate due to a cause of loss covered under your policy:</strong> Additional living expenses are sometimes triggered if a civil authority like the police or emergency management service prohibits you from staying in your home. This is only available if neighboring properties suffer direct physical damage that is covered under your policy and that is the reason the civil authority is prohibiting you from returning home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional living expense coverage often depends on how your insurer defines “uninhabitable.” Conditions of coverage may also vary. For example, if the insurer finds temporary housing that has a kitchen, then dining out is often not a covered expense. So be sure to ask your insurance provider for some additional living expenses examples for your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcaniuseadditionallivingexpensesfor\">What Can I Use Additional Living Expenses For?</h2>\n<p>A claim that causes you to have to move out of your home can be stressful, and racking up unexpected expenses can add to the overwhelm. The good news is that loss of use protection is designed to take some of that worry off your plate.</p>\n<p>Additional living expense coverage can potentially pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary accommodations, such as a hotel, Airbnb, or apartment.</li>\n<li>Extra transportation costs.</li>\n<li>Pet boarding if necessary.</li>\n<li>Reasonable restaurant bills if you are unable to cook.</li>\n<li>Relocation and storage of personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Laundry expenses.</li>\n<li>Parking fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional expense coverage also includes <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a> that's important to know if you rent out a portion of your home. Fair rental value coverage can reimburse you for lost rent if a covered claim makes the rental portion of your home uninhabitable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongdoadditionalexpenseslast\">How Long Do Additional Expenses Last?</h2>\n<p>Every insurance policy is different, but most <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> state that additional living expense payments are paid only for the shortest time required to repair damage or for you to relocate if relocation is necessary – usually about 12 months. Homeowners who rent out space in their homes get just two weeks of rent replacement if there’s a mandatory evacuation as explained above. Additionally, policies have a limit to the amount of money available for additional use expenses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filinganadditionalexpensesclaim\">Filing an Additional Expenses Claim</h2>\n<p>Your insurance company doesn’t simply write you a check for your additional expenses. In fact, insurers only reimburse you for the money you spend above and beyond your normal living expenses. This means you need to document all of your costs by providing rental agreements, gas receipts, restaurant receipts, and any other bill you incur while you’re unable to live in your home. Your claims representative may provide a worksheet to categorize and track your expenses.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the additional living expenses won’t cover all costs while you are displaced – only additional costs. It won’t pay for your mortgage, your regular grocery bill, or your kids’ tennis lessons. Those are your normal budgeted expenses and still your responsibility while displaced.</p>\n<p>Plus, your insurance company may deduct money you save while you’re not in your home. For example, say your utility bills are lower at your temporary residence than what you normally pay. Your insurer may subtract those savings from your additional expenses payment.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, remember that additional expenses generally only kick in for <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">covered disasters</a> that make your home unlivable. If you’re unsure about what triggers your coverage, be sure to, talk to your insurance provider.</p>"

    body: "<p>Even if you're not sure if you have a claim on your hands, it's probably worth giving your insurance company a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentocallyourhomeownersinsuranceprovider\">When to Call Your Homeowners Insurance Provider</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance is often one of those things you hope you’ll never have to use. Sure, it’s good to have coverage if a disaster hits your house, but it’s even better if no disaster happens. The best-case scenario would be if you could just buy your homeowners insurance and never think about it again.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are some situations where you should call your house insurance company. Knowing when it makes sense to pick up the phone can make a big difference in the long-term outcomes of your coverage.</p>\n<p>Even if an incident hasn’t become an insurance claim, it may make sense to call your insurance company to let them know about it. Here are some common incidents that should trigger a phone call.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A guest gets hurt while visiting you</strong>. You don’t need to pick up the phone every time one of your kid’s friends gets a paper cut, but if a guest sustains a more substantial injury, dial up your house insurance company. Why? Because most insurance includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical expenses coverage</a> specifically for these situations. If you eventually try to make a claim, it’s best that your insurance company knows about it sooner rather than later. That makes the claims process run more smoothly.</li>\n<li><strong>Your home is damaged</strong>. If a <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">tree</a> falls through your roof, a pipe bursts, there’s a fire, or any other sort of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">property damage that your insurance policy covers</a>, contact your insurance company. This kickstarts the claims process so you can get the problem fixed and get back to your life.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re robbed or your house is vandalized</strong>. If this happens (and we hope it never does), call the police first. But once you’ve dealt with the criminal side of the issue, get in touch with your insurance company. The property insurance portion of your homeowners policy should cover repairs to property damaged by theft or robbery, so you’ll need to make a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re renovating!</strong> Whenever you make major changes to your house (updating your roof, building an addition, installing custom cabinetry), your insurance provider needs to know about it. You bought the policy for the house as it existed at the time of purchase; if and when the property changes, your insurance may need to be adjusted, too. The good news is some changes, like updating your roof, can actually save you money on premiums.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re getting a trampoline or</strong> <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\"><strong>pool</strong></a>. Both of these features affect the risk profile of your home and may impact your coverage needs. The liability portion of your insurance offers payments if and when guests are injured at your house, so your insurance company needs to know if you’re adding features that make it easier for people to get injured – or easy to get more seriously injured.</li>\n<li><strong>You started a business from home</strong>. This doesn’t just mean setting up a silk-screening operation in your basement. From an insurance company’s perspective, a home business is any activity that brings in revenue and operates out of your house: daycare, piano lessons, <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">Airbnb hosting</a>, consulting, etc. Most homeowners policies exclude coverage for business-related activities carried out on the homeowner’s property, so if you don’t update your coverage, you may be operating unprotected. Worse, you may void other parts of your policy just by operating the business. Ask your insurance company whether it can offer you a business owner’s policy or refer you to a company that can.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re getting married (at your house)</strong>. Or you’re hosting any major event there where people are drinking and celebrating. While most homeowners insurance policies include coverage for the damage a drunk guest might cause after leaving your home, the lines get fuzzy as the crowds get bigger. You may not need any additional coverage, but play it safe and talk to your insurance company before the big event. If your homeowners coverage isn’t up to the job, a special event policy should cover your big day.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think of it this way: if something affects one of the major areas that your house insurance protects, it’s probably wise to loop in the insurance company. At worst, it will be a quick call. At best, you’ll save yourself from having a claim denied down the road because you didn’t update your policy in time.</p>"

    body: "<p>Do you know how much your home is worth? We’re not talking about what you paid for your home – that value has probably changed. Home improvements, a new neighborhood school, and even your landscaping can affect your home’s value.</p>\n<p>Getting your home reappraised is the only way to know what your home is currently worth. Of course, this information is only useful for certain situations. A good rule of thumb is to get your home reappraised when you’re considering making a major life change that involves <a href=\"/faq/trust-owned-home-insurance/\">your home</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the financial, home-related, and external reasons to get your home reappraised.</p>\n<h2 id=\"financialreasonsforahomereappraisal\">Financial Reasons for a Home Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a reappraisal makes sense when you’re about to make a big financial decision. For example, you might get your home reappraised when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You want to sell your home.</strong> A home reappraisal can help you determine the <a href=\"/blog/virtual-stage-your-home/\">listing price</a>. During the appraisal process, your home is typically compared to <a href=\"http://homeguides.sfgate.com/reasons-getting-house-appraisal-1201.html\">homes in your neighborhood</a> with comparable square footage, bathrooms, and other structures, like fencing and sheds. The appraiser then adds or subtracts value depending on additions or faults that don’t appear in comparable homes. Install new piping? Great! Is your home missing an extra closet or two? That may take away from its overall value.</li>\n<li><strong>You want to refinance or get a home equity loan.</strong> If you want to refinance your mortgage, your lender will likely require a home reappraisal. Home equity loans are also based on the value of your home. If you’ve made improvements to your home that add to its value, that can help you out when you refinance your mortgage, for example, if you have an FHA loan and you’re still paying mortgage insurance. Once you have home equity of 20 percent, the lender will often drop the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-mortgage-insurance-and-how-does-it-work-en-1953/\">mortgage insurance requirement</a>, which saves you money each month.</li>\n<li><strong>You want to take out another type of loan.</strong> When it comes to some loan application processes, such as for business or car loans, you may need to put up your home as collateral. In these cases, the lender may require you to get your home reappraised to understand its current value. You’d show the appraisal documentation to the lender to move forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"homerelatedreasonsforreappraisal\">Home-Related Reasons for Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>Updates to the home can increase its value. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In-home repairs.</strong> These may include removing chipped paint, fixing loose floorboards, and updating old fixtures. Many of these are <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">simple DIY projects</a> you can tackle over a weekend. Keep in mind that appraisers also check installed home devices during inspection, so test your carbon monoxide, home security, and smoke alarms, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Large home Improvement and renovation projects.</strong> Appraisers typically value homes in $500 increments. If you’re considering a repair that will cost more than this amount, consider getting your home appraised afterward. For example, large outdoor projects like new landscaping or a new walkway may impact the home’s value, as well as indoor projects like new tiles, new carpet, or windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>G. Stacy Sirmans, real estate professor at Florida State University, recommends that homeowners start with minor improvements to the bathroom and kitchen. He also says that wood flooring, landscaping, and an enclosed garage can drive up appraisal values.</p>\n<p>It also helps to document the improvements with before and after photos. You can show these to your home appraiser to help them make a more accurate estimation of the value these renovations created.</p>\n<h2 id=\"externalfactorsforahomereappraisal\">External Factors for a Home Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>These factors that are outside your control can impact the value of your home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Changes in the neighborhood.</strong> If your neighbors update their houses to add curb appeal, people may pay more to live there.</li>\n<li><strong>Road upgrades.</strong> Updated infrastructure can make a location more appealing to future homebuyers.</li>\n<li><strong>New schools.</strong> Young families may be attracted to areas with nearby schools.</li>\n<li><strong>New local amenities.</strong> The opening of nearby parks, stores, and community centers can make your area more attractive on the housing market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"findingahomeappraiser\">Finding a Home Appraiser</h2>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to do your own research to get a better feel of your neighborhood’s value. Talk to your neighbors about their own home appraisals and what factors the appraiser noted. Home appraisals are often on public record, too.</p>\n<p>Ideally, your home appraiser should live within a 10-mile radius of your home so they are familiar with the area. If they aren’t, don’t be afraid to explain to your home appraiser the selling points of your neighborhood. This may help prevent your home from being undervalued.</p>\n<h2 id=\"willareappraisalincreaseyourhomeinsurancepremium\">Will a Reappraisal Increase Your Home Insurance Premium?</h2>\n<p>A reappraisal will tell you the value of your home, but that isn’t what the cost of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a> is based on. Home insurance companies consider the replacement cost of your home when offering and pricing your coverage. The replacement cost is how much it would be to rebuild your home with similar, new materials. This figure doesn’t take into account the intangibles that make your home appealing to, say, potential homebuyers (such as a good school district or local amenities).</p>\n<p>So regardless of whether your home increases or decreases in value, your reappraisal typically won’t impact your home insurance premiums. However, if your home increases in value because you remodeled the kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances, you should <a href=\"/blog/when-to-call-home-insurance-company/\">give your home insurance company a call</a>. You want to make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> is still appropriate if you ever need to repair or replace those shiny new items.</p>"

    body: "<p>Unlike other major household systems, a roof doesn’t come with a “best by” date. Roofs don’t age consistently, so there’s no set answer for how often a roof should be replaced. A <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-roof-leaks/\">leaky roof</a> is proof enough that you need a repair. But how do you know when it’s time to replace your roof entirely?</p>\n<p>Best practices state you should spot check your roof twice a year, typically in the fall and spring. How often you’ll need a full inspection depends on what your roof is made of. Different roofing materials decay at different rates. Composite, asphalt, and wooden shingles usually need a professional inspection every three years, whereas a tile roof may need one every five years.</p>\n<p>That said, these factors may prompt you to call a professional and get your roof replaced. (Bonus: Doing so can reduce your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a>.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"1yourroofsage\">1. Your roof’s age</h3>\n<p>The age of your roof is a good starting point to determine when it’s due for a replacement. Experts usually say a <a href=\"/blog/how-long-do-roofs-last/\">roof should last</a> about 20 years, but that also depends on the composition of the roof. The list below provides examples of the typical longevity for several types of roofing materials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asphalt roll roof: 5 to 10 years</li>\n<li>Composite shingle roof: 15 years</li>\n<li>Wood shingle roof: approximately 25 years</li>\n<li>Standing seam metal roof: 20 to 50 years</li>\n<li>Wood shake shingle roof: 35 to 40 years</li>\n<li>Clay tile roof / Spanish tile roof: 40 to 50 years (Underlayment lasts approximately 15 years)</li>\n<li>Slate roof: 100+ years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How your roof was installed can also impact its longevity. For example, a roof installed over an existing layer of shingles usually needs to be replaced after no more than 20 years.</p>\n<p>While you may be able to lengthen the life of your roof with spot treatments, these are the ages where the material in roofs starts to fail. Delaying installation greatly increases the risk of water intrusion and other issues that can cause real and lasting damage to a home. So really, you want to start thinking about a new roof before yours hits the upper limits of these ranges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2buckledandcurledshingles\">2. Buckled and curled shingles</h3>\n<p>Your shingles should lie flat against the roof. If they are curling, buckled, or damaged, your roof is showing signs of substantial wear.</p>\n<p>Another way to check? Inspect your gutters and downspouts for shingle granules. Roofs that are nearing the end of their life tend to shed these easily.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3rustedroofvalleys\">3. Rusted roof valleys</h3>\n<p>A roof valley is usually a V-shaped metal channel found in the “folds” of the roof. The valley helps snow and rain flow off your roof into the gutter. If your valleys are rusted, your roof can leak into your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4missingshinglesortiles\">4. Missing shingles or tiles</h3>\n<p>If your roof is missing shingles, tiles, or tabs, at minimum you need to repair the missing components. At worst, this may be another sign your roof’s useful days are numbered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5gapsinchimneyflashing\">5. Gaps in chimney flashing</h3>\n<p>The flashing around the vents, skylights, and chimney on your roof help fortify these openings against leaks. That’s why it’s extremely important to make sure there are no cracks or breaks in the flashing, especially if it’s made of cement or tar, which erodes over time. Metal flashing typically has a longer life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6daylightthroughroofboards\">6. Daylight through roof boards</h3>\n<p>If you’re considering getting a new roof, a trip to your attic is in order. From here, you can check the roof deck and look for daylight through the roof boards – this is a sign that water has an entry point into your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7saggingandmoss\">7. Sagging and moss</h3>\n<p>A roof that’s trapping moisture is usually one that needs a replacement. You can spot signs of moisture in your roof a few ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examine the insulation in the attic – if it’s moist, you likely have a roof leak.</li>\n<li>Check for moss, mold, and fungi on and around the roof.</li>\n<li>Look for sagging in the roof and for rotting boards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, some damage doesn’t necessarily mean you need to replace the roof entirely. But if you see a few of the signs listed in this guide, call a professional to get your roof inspected and to get an expert opinion. If you’re in a hurricane-prone region, this might be a good opportunity for you to make your roof more wind-resistant, too. Read about <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a> for more insight.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoroofsneedtobereplaced\">Why do roofs need to be replaced?</h2>\n<p>A home’s roof protects the structure and its contents from wind, rain, and other elements. It’s a critical component of shelter from the elements, keeping your family and belongings safe, and protecting the rest of your house from damage and decay that weather and other factors can cause.</p>\n<p>That’s probably enough of a reason to replace your roof, but there are other situations where you may want to take a close look at the shape your roof is in. For example, you may want a new roof if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You’re remodeling.</strong> Your roof can look mismatched if you add an addition without installing a new roof.</li>\n<li><strong>You have storm damage.</strong> Like we said, spot repairs may be okay for some damage, but they may not be enough for older roofs, so get a professional to evaluate damage after a storm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like anything else, the materials that comprise a roof break down over time. No matter what material it’s made of, a roof needs to be replaced periodically. Installing a new roof is also an opportunity to check the condition of your sub-roof, repair any hidden damage, and reseal peaks, valleys, vents, and other elements. This helps ensure that your roof will continue to protect your home and its critical systems, allowing your home to maintain its value into the future.</p>\n<p>Are you surprised at how important your roof is?

    body: "<p>Tree maintenance can help prevent damage to your home. Of course, summer is not the best time to prune your trees in most parts of North America, but it is a great season to give them some extra love and attention. This effort may include the application of regular water, a fresh skirt of mulch, and in some cases, selectively trimming a few branches.</p>\n<p>Summertime is a season of extreme weather, and even the hardiest trees may be challenged by hurricane-strength winds or warm conditions that favor pests. Let’s look at summer tree care in more detail, including pruning, irrigation, pest control, and how to prevent storm damage. We’ll also explore a few ways to reduce tree damage risks, even if you have an awesome <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy that may cover this damage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tree maintenance can help prevent damage to your home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"treetrimmingtipstotrimornottotrim\">Tree Trimming Tips: To Trim or Not to Trim?</h2>\n<p>Tree trimming helps manage risk by removing branches that are likely to fall on the roof, smash through windows, interfere with power lines, or otherwise wreak havoc on your property and your life.</p>\n<p>But before taking out your shears, study up on pruning essentials. If you’re new to tree maintenance, the Arbor Day Foundation provides a helpful <a href=\"https://www.arborday.org/trees/tips/\">guide to tree trimming</a> along with instructional videos.</p>\n<p>Summer is not typically the right season to prune your trees, as that’s an activity best reserved for when the trees are dormant in winter, but there are a few situations in which you may want to make cuts during this active season:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the event that a branch breaks or your tree is impacted by a storm, it may be appropriate to minimize tree damage by trimming back the broken area or branches. While you can always clean up after a <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane or severe windstorm</a>, it’s best to lop off any precarious branches as soon as you identify that they may pose a hazard.</li>\n<li>If a tree shows signs of rot or infestation, take action as soon as possible to prevent falling limbs or potential liability for injury or property damage. We're not arborists, but we do know falling limbs are often culprits for claims.</li>\n<li>Trimming your tree is an effective way to redirect growth. In early summer, right after seasonal growth is complete, you may want to trim any new branches that are headed in undesirable directions. This may be because they’re headed toward your home, a power line, or another structure. Or you may want to do this for aesthetic purposes. Both are fair reasons to make cuts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can always hire an arborist or yard specialist to help you out if you don’t feel confident making these changes yourself. Of course, if your plans include trimming back branches that hang over your roof or an insured structure, be sure you hire a qualified, insured professional to assist you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unsure about how to trim your trees to redirect growth? An arborist can help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whentowateryourtrees\">When to Water Your Trees</h2>\n<p>Why water your trees? Dry trees are more likely to catch fire in the event of a lightning strike or live sparks from a power line. Minimize the likelihood of conflagrations with some basic watering.</p>\n<p>It can be hard to know when to water your trees. To check the moisture level in your yard, in most climates, dig a small trough that’s two inches deep. Use your hand to check to see if the soil is dry. If so, your tree may need a drink. In most places, your best options are hand watering with a hose or installing a drip irrigation system to assist with a regular watering cycle.</p>\n<p>Pay special attention to your youngest trees. During the first two years of growth, a newly planted tree may have trouble coping with extreme heat and drought.</p>\n<p>You can ease heat-related stress on trees of any age by watering the tree regularly and <a href=\"https://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-and-plant-advice/horticulture-care/mulching-trees-and-shrubs\">covering the topsoil with mulch</a> to help keep the moisture in the ground. This also helps nurture root growth. Even into July, it’s not too late to add a couple of inches of nutrient-rich material to insulate your tree's roots from extremes.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you live in a dry climate with drought-ready trees, this advice does not apply. Whatever the climate, what’s important is to maintain healthy trees, especially those that could potentially fall onto your insured dwelling or outbuildings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dry trees are more likely to catch fire in the event of a lightning strike.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howtoinspectforpests\">How to Inspect for Pests</h2>\n<p>Pests are dangerous because their activity can hollow out or even kill a tree, making it susceptible to crashing into your home in high winds. Prevent disaster by keeping an eye out for the early signs of unwanted visitors.</p>\n<p>Pest populations largely depend on where you live, but you should be aware of the signs that local pests may be interested in snacking on your trees. There are a few obvious signs of trouble you can keep an eye out for in any regions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your tree didn’t send out new growth this spring or if it’s slower than the rest of the yard to regain its foliage, there may be something wrong. If you have evergreens, you may notice browning or dropped needles. Don’t ignore these signs of distress.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for insects like moths or beetles making their homes in the branches.</li>\n<li>Look for holes or damage to foliage and branches.</li>\n<li>Inspect your leaves and branches for galls (wart-like growths) or other evidence that someone has taken up residence inside the tree itself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Know your regional pests and the signs of their presence. Most state websites offer guides to local agricultural troublemakers, and many of these also have an appetite for foliage. For example, check out <a href=\"http://ipm.ifas.ufl.edu/applying/Florida's_Major_Agricultural_Pests.shtml\">Florida’s list of pests</a> and how to identify them. Floridians, Georgians, and other homeowners on the Gulf Coast should keep an eye out for signs of <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">termites</a>, as they are a known issue in this area. Like many pests that pose a threat to tree health, termites are also potential troublemakers inside your home.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Know your regional pests and the signs of their presence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancestormsandtreedamage\">Home Insurance, Storms, and Tree Damage</h2>\n<p>Storms can cause major damage to your home and the trees around it: <a href=\"/blog/effects-of-thunderstorms/\">thunderstorms</a>, lightning, heavy winds, and floodwaters pose unique threats to your arbor and the things your trees may fall onto.</p>\n<p>You may wonder, “If a tree falls on my insured structure, is it covered?” or “Does homeowners insurance cover tree removal after a storm?” Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If a tree falls in your yard</strong>, it probably doesn’t matter who owns the tree – it could be yours or it could come from your neighbor’s yard. Lightning and wind don’t know whose side of a property line they strike. After a major storm like a hurricane or flood, an insurance company is unlikely to spend time investigating where the tree came from. If your insured structure is hit by a tree, you can usually submit a claim.</li>\n<li>It may be the case, <strong>if the tree came from a neighbor’s yard</strong>, that your insurance company may try to collect from the neighbor’s insurance company through a process called subrogation. Either way, this won’t happen until after they pay your claim.</li>\n<li>You may be covered by your homeowners insurance for some or all of the cost of tree removal <strong>if the tree hit an insured structure</strong>. If no structure was damaged, it’s unlikely you’ll get help with the cost of debris removal or damage to your tree.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If, at the end of this list, you’re still wondering how this would apply to a tree incident you’ve experienced (or fear), here are two more common examples of tree trouble to help you answer the question, “Does home insurance cover…”</p>\n<h3 id=\"exampleadoeshomeownersinsurancecovertreeremoval\">Example A: Does homeowners insurance cover tree removal?</h3>\n<p>An oak tree is struck by lightning and splits in two. Somehow, the tree misses your garage, the car parked in the driveway, and the house. Even if it’s partially obstructing the road and will need to be removed right away, homeowners insurance won’t help you cover the cost of removal.</p>\n<p>If, however, a branch crushed a portion of the <a href=\"/blog/good-fences-make-good-neighbors/\">fence</a> that now needs replacement, you may want to consider submitting a homeowners insurance claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"examplebwhathappenswhenadeadtreefalls\">Example B: What happens when a dead tree falls?</h3>\n<p>This could happen during a storm or on any given day, but when the dead tree in your neighbor’s yard falls onto your fence, it may cause major damage on your property. In this case, let’s say the whole fence line comes down, but that the tree doesn’t hit your house.</p>\n<p>Do you know the answer by now? If you have homeowners insurance and the fence was on your property, it’s likely covered by your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"havetherightinsurancecoveragebeforeastormarrives\">Have the Right Insurance Coverage Before a Storm Arrives</h2>\n<p>The best preventative measure you can take is one this post has already covered: annual tree trimming can reduce the number of weak or damaged branches on your property, which will help reduce the risk of a branch breaking or falling onto an insured structure. There’s not much else you can do to prepare for the unexpected, aside from being properly insured.</p>\n<p>After a storm or damage from weather, be sure to take photos to document any damage to your property. Then call your insurance agent. They’ll be happy to help you work through any questions or claims.</p>"

    body: "<p>People often buy home insurance and then forget about it. They pay their policy premium the same time they pay their mortgage bill and don’t think about it again. Unfortunately, that means they risk being either underinsured or paying for more coverage than they actually need.</p>\n<p>You most likely need to review your coverage whenever you have a major change in your situation. Here are several instances when you may need to update your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1youjustfinishedarenovation\">1. You Just Finished a Renovation.</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> on your homeowners policy is based on your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimate</a> (i.e., what it costs to rebuild your home), and a major renovation or remodeling project can change that amount. For example, you may want to review your home insurance if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade your flooring to hardwood.</li>\n<li>Add square footage.</li>\n<li>Finish your basement.</li>\n<li>Improve your cabinets or countertops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">our handy guide</a> to get a rough estimate of how much dwelling coverage you need after a renovation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2youbroughtanewdoghome\">2. You Brought a New Dog Home.</h2>\n<p>Bringing a dog into your home is a great idea, but it can affect your homeowners insurance. In fact, you can’t assume your insurance company covers your dog at all. Many companies have <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breed lists</a> that make it difficult for some dog owners to get covered. If your dog is on that list, your insurer may not pay claims relating to dog bites or other damage your dog causes.</p>\n<p>Even if your insurance company does cover your dog, it may charge a higher premium. You might also want to update the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> in your homeowners insurance to make sure you have enough to cover the additional risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3youpurchasedsomethingexpensive\">3. You Purchased Something Expensive.</h2>\n<p>Big-ticket items like a new television or expensive furniture may mean you need to review how much <a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">personal property coverage</a> you have. If you don’t have enough for the new items, you’ll want to increase your coverage limits as soon as possible to protect against loss. Certain high-value items such as jewelry or fine art may require a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4youaddedaswimmingpool\">4. You Added a Swimming Pool.</h2>\n<p>A swimming pool may increase the amount of dwelling coverage you need, but it can also mean you need additional liability coverage. Insurance professionals call swimming pools and similar items “<a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a>” because they often invite trouble. Other examples of attractive nuisances include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trampolines.</li>\n<li>Tree houses.</li>\n<li>Playground equipment.</li>\n<li>Water features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can be held responsible if a child is injured by these or similar items, so you may want higher liability limits if you install one or something similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Swimming pools sometimes fall under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5youinstalledasecuritysystem\">5. You Installed a Security System.</h2>\n<p>Installing a security system can help you sleep better at night, but you should also call your insurance agent once it’s in. Many home insurance companies offer discounts for home monitoring and security systems, burglar alarms, and deadbolts or smart locks. Some even offer discounts if you live in a gated community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6yougotawatershutoffdevice\">6. You Got a Water Shut-Off Device.</h2>\n<p>A water shut-off device is another good way to earn a homeowners insurance discount. These devices can automatically turn off the water supply to your house when they detect leaks. Water flow sensors can have similar shut-off features that catch irregular flow through your pipes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7youboughtanewroof\">7. You Bought a New Roof.</h2>\n<p>As your roof ages, it becomes more prone to damage, and that means you’re more likely to file a claim. Your insurance company accounts for this risk by charging a higher premium. But you often see a better rate once you install a roof. You may even see lower homeowners insurance costs if you retrofit your current roof with wind mitigation features like <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8youstartedahomebusiness\">8. You Started a Home Business.</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners policies offer limited coverage for business equipment, so you may have enough insurance if you don’t have a lot of inventory or specialized equipment. That said, liability claims related to a home-based business are almost always excluded. You may be able to fix that with an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a>, but you might also need a separate commercial insurance policy. Either way, starting a business is a good time to review what is (and can be) covered by your home policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9yourentedoutyourhome\">9. You Rented Out Your Home.</h2>\n<p>Once you decide to rent your home, you become a landlord and that usually means you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>. That’s an altogether different type of policy than your homeowners policy, but it’s important to make the change because your risks changed. For example, your liability risk increases because you can’t control the activity that goes on or guests that go into your home when it isn’t your dwelling.</p>\n<p>Landlord insurance also covers the dwelling, other structures, and any personal property you leave on site to service the home. Your tenant’s property, however, is not covered. Policy also may have coverage for unoccupied spaces and for your <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">rental income</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>A home inspection is an essential part of buying a house. This part of the process protects home buyers from unknowingly purchasing property with expensive, hidden issues.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a home inspection reveals problems that sellers don’t want to fix and are deal breakers for the buyer. But how can you tell when an inspection unveils a true lemon?</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at when experts say it’s time to walk away from a property after a <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomeinspection\">What is a home inspection?</h2>\n<p>A home inspection is a non-invasive examination of a real estate property’s condition. The home buyer typically hires the inspector after their offer on the house is accepted.</p>\n<p>The inspector looks the home’s structure and systems, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plumbing.</li>\n<li>HVAC units.</li>\n<li>Electrical panel.</li>\n<li>Appliances.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Roof</a>.</li>\n<li>Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inspector will examine the roof for deteriorating segments and look for water marks on interior ceilings which may indicate leaks. They’ll also check out the foundation for damage or cracks that could indicate serious structural issues for the home.</p>\n<p>Inspections also detail the age and working condition of appliances, including the refrigerator, range, built-in microwave, and water heater. If a washer and dryer are included in the sale, the inspection will list those in the report, too.</p>\n<p>The inspection also notes evidence of infestations, whether that is <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">termites</a> or other bugs and rodents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattoexpectinahomeinspectionreport\">What to expect in a home inspection report</h2>\n<p>Few homes will come away from an inspection without any issues. The general rule is that the older the house is, the more line item issues a home inspection may reveal. But even new homes may have some problems in the inspection report.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s totally normal when a home inspection report notes some issues. In most cases, problems in the report are used for negotiation: the buyer can either ask for the repairs or a credit in escrow to reduce the price of the house.</p>\n<p>Homes are sold “as is” are the exception. This means the seller knows there are things wrong with the home and may even disclose most of them at the onset of escrow (if not before). In “as is” sales, the owner is less likely to negotiate on items already disclosed or noted in a report because they have likely priced the home to account for these issues. When dealing with an “as is” property, buyers should use the inspection report to confirm existing issues and determine if the price of the home makes sense for the work that needs to be done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thingsthatfailahomeinspection\">Things that fail a home inspection</h2>\n<p>It’s important to understand that the inspection report isn’t a pass/fail type of document. It methodically names systems and appliances and their condition. It details problems so that homebuyers have the information to make an informed decision.</p>\n<p>Some issues are bigger concerns than others and may lead to bigger concerns for homebuyers.</p>\n<p>The most common problems that may cause a buyer to walk are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Major mechanical issues with the furnace, A/C, water heater, electrical, or plumbing.</li>\n<li>Structural issues, like bowing foundation, split rafters in the attic, and rotted wood.</li>\n<li>Cosmetic issues, like wear and tear to the siding, roof, and decking.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">Mold</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A “failed” report may cause a buyer to walk from the deal, especially if the seller isn’t willing to address the issues. However, sellers are often motivated to negotiate based on requests of the homebuyer’s inspection report.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reasonablerequestsafterahomeinspection\">Reasonable requests after a home inspection</h2>\n<p>It’s important to manage expectations when making repair requests following your inspection. After a home inspection, you can usually make one of two requests: have the owner fix the problem or get a credit for the repairs in escrow. A savvy realtor can be a big help here: they can help you understand the price of repairs and whether sellers are likely to comply.</p>\n<p>“It’s reasonable to expect the seller to fix any deferred maintenance items,” says realtor <a href=\"http://tamthomes.com/\">Kimberly Mann</a>. “Deferred maintenance is any item that the seller should have been taking care of in the home but hadn't. This often happens when sellers are unaware of what they should be keeping up with.”</p>\n<p>It’s usually reasonable to ask for repairs for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple electrical issues, like changing out old outlets to GFCI outlets.</li>\n<li>Plumbing, like snaking existing plumbing to clear out pipes.</li>\n<li>Termite issues, like tenting the house before escrow closes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally, smaller issues can be dealt with quickly and easily. In most cases, the seller is willing to get it fixed or negotiate a credit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentowalkawayafterahomeinspection\">When to walk away after a home inspection</h2>\n<p>We’ll say it again: there’s no hard and fast rule for when to walk away from a home after an inspection. It completely depends on how much you want the home and how willing you are to make the repairs yourself if the seller isn’t willing to negotiate.</p>\n<p>As real estate investor <a href=\"http://www.717homebuyers.com/\">Josh Eberly</a> says, “You can technically ask for anything during the inspection period even if the house is being sold ‘as is.’ Though the intent of the seller has already been made, it’s not uncommon for there to be major additional issues uncovered during the inspection. Negotiating this can be of advantage to the buyer because the seller may not want to walk away from the deal.”</p>\n<p>As a home buyer, you should have a strategy for the negotiation. Ultimately you have to be comfortable with the cost (or work) of any repairs that a seller won’t do. For someone who is handy, fixing the problem themselves may only require sweat equity and a few dollars in materials or parts. But as the cost of repairs rises, consider whether the value of the home is worth it.</p>\n<p>A home that needs a lot of repairs may not get appraised at the value of the selling price. In a situation like this, you may have no option but to walk away from the property because the loan will not fund.</p>\n<p>“It can be difficult but homebuyers should be prepared for anything until they've had an inspection,” says Jeff Falkowski of <a href=\"https://www.housereportcard.com/\">House Report Card</a>. “You may need to let the deal fall through or renegotiate after you get the results. The home inspection is another step in the home buying process, not the last step.”</p>\n<p>If the seller isn’t willing to negotiate, buyers should consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the cost of the repair?</li>\n<li>Are there unseen potential costs with the repair (e.g., fixing one plumbing issue shows a much bigger problem once a professional opens up the pipes)?</li>\n<li>Are you able to fix the problem with sweat equity?</li>\n<li>Can you afford the house plus the costs of repairs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you answer these questions, you’ll be in a better position to practically determine whether or not you should walk away from the house. If you can’t afford it, it’s a money pit you don’t want. Even if you can afford it, it may not be worth the total price of the house plus fixes and you might be better off buying a home that has fewer headaches.</p>"

    body: "<p>This year has been a busy one for natural disasters. Around the United States, bad weather and bad luck have caused billions of dollars in damage. As a homeowner, you probably hear about these events and wonder: would my <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> cover me for that?</p>\n<p>Let's look at some recent disasters and break down what your home insurance would likely cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverhurricanes\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Hurricanes Florence and Michael battered the eastern United States in late summer, and Hurricane Willa made landfall in October, bringing heavy rain to parts of Texas and Mexico. This makes two consecutive years of seriously damaging hurricanes, and climate scientists agree that this is our new normal.</p>\n<p>So how can you expect your homeowners insurance to behave if you're caught in the path of a hurricane?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wind damage from hurricanes is typically covered</strong>. We tend to think of <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> in terms of water, but they’re also known for high winds. If those winds damage your property (e.g., by ripping off <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof shingles</a>), your home insurance will likely pay for necessary repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Flood damage is not covered</strong>. Homeowners insurance doesn’t offer coverage for water that comes in from outside your home. For that, you’ll need a separate <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just as important as having the right policies, though, is making sure your property is ready to withstand extreme weather. Check out our tips on <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">prepping your home for hurricanes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gasexplosionsfiresaretypicallycovered\">Gas Explosions: Fires Are Typically Covered</h2>\n<p>In September, several homes in Massachusetts caught fire (and a few residents died) when their gas lines exploded because pressure in the pipelines was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pressure-massachusetts-gas-explosions-was-12-times-higher-normal-n910581\">12 times higher than it was supposed to be</a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously, home insurance can’t do anything to fix the tragedy of lost life. But it can respond to other parts of this incident:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire damage is typically covered</strong>. Fires are a covered peril in nearly every homeowners insurance policy, so homeowners can likely make a claim to repair any damage caused by fires the explosions sparked.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use is usually covered</strong>. In cases where a home becomes uninhabitable because of a covered peril, homeowners insurance can typically pay for the residents to live somewhere else until their home is livable again. In the case of the gas explosions, thousands of residents had their gas turned off while the gas company made repairs – meaning no heat, hot water, or cooking gas. Most residents have reportedly opted to live elsewhere, especially as the winter approaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this situation, the gas company is apparently paying for some of these costs (including, in some cases, temporary housing). Regardless of the details of the incident, though, an insurance provider may attempt to recover some expenses from a responsible party (like the gas company), if there is one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"volcanoeruptionslavaisntcovered\">Volcano Eruptions: Lava Isn't Covered</h2>\n<p>In May, a volcano in Hawaii <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/07/636416200/hawaii-volcano-quiets-after-months-long-eruption\">erupted</a>, wiping out roads and entire communities in its wake. But the residents affected by the spewing lava are still living with the consequences. Here’s what their home insurance likely did and did not cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fires and ash-related damage may be covered</strong>. Again, fires are a covered peril in most policies, even if they’re started by a volcano. So a typical policy may pay for damage related to a volcano-ignited fire. It may also pay for removal of ash, which can gather in homes near an eruption.</li>\n<li><strong>Lava flow and other “earth movements” are not covered</strong>. Typical homeowners policies exclude “earth movement,” which is often interpreted as earthquakes, but also includes mudflow and lava flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you live in an area with active volcanoes, contact your insurance provider about additional coverage that would protect you in the event of an eruption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wildfiresandmudslidesitreallydepends\">Wildfires and Mudslides: It Really Depends</h2>\n<p>As of October, wildfires had burned <a href=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm\">more than eight million acres</a> of land in the United States in 2018, and that number is even higher now due to the latest wildfires in California. While homeowners insurance usually covers damage from fires, some homeowners in wildfire-heavy areas may not have this coverage (or may pay a high premium for it). Check your policy when in doubt.</p>\n<p>Also worth noting: Mudslides common in some parts of the country are usually not covered. As with volcanoes, homeowners at risk for “earth movement” may want to seek alternate coverage or invest in infrastructure that could help prevent damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectingyourhomeinadisaster\">Protecting Your Home in a Disaster</h2>\n<p>One of the worst feelings a homeowner can have is finding out that damage to their home is not covered by their policy. Protecting your home starts with understanding the ins and outs of your policy – and shoring it up with additional insurance, if necessary.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the importance of prevention: even the best insurance in the world can’t prevent bad things from happening – and in the case of natural disasters, neither can you.

    body: "<p>Homeowners who get their flood insurance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may see their premiums go up starting on April 1, 2022﹘that is, if they haven’t seen rates increase already. The agency announced a change to its rating system late last year and has been rolling it out ever since.</p>\n<p>The result? Approximately 82 percent of single family homeowners insured through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) have seen or will see flood insurance rate increases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewillnfipfloodinsuranceratesincreasethemost\">Where Will NFIP Flood Insurance Rates Increase the Most?</h2>\n<p>FEMA has provided an <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/44d08581aaf14f39bc0da5d02f378007\">interactive map</a>, developed by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Association of State Floodplain Managers, to help homeowners identify if their property will see a rate increase. Highlights include NFIP flood insurance rate increases for approximately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>89 percent of Texas single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>88 percent of Florida single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>87 percent of Mississippi single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>85 percent of Alabama single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>83 percent of Louisiana single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>80 percent of South Carolina single family homeowners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners in coastal states will likely be hit hardest by the flood insurance rate increase caused by Risk Rating 2.0. This is partly due to the annual hurricane season that generates significant rain and storm surge that make these properties extremely susceptible to flooding. However, floods can happen anywhere it rains, so in reality, <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">flood insurance is for everyone</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a deeper look at exactly what this new rollout is about and how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyarefemafloodinsuranceratesgoingup\">Why Are FEMA Flood Insurance Rates Going Up?</h2>\n<p>The main reason FEMA’s flood insurance rates are going up is because the agency has overhauled the way it sets prices. Called <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating\">Risk Rating 2.0</a>, the new methodology applies what FEMA describes as cutting-edge technology to current flood maps in hopes of creating premiums that better represent policyholders’ actual risk.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s previous rating methodology, which had not been updated since the 1970s, focused on a property’s elevation within a given flood zone as outlined on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). But under that system, certain communities paid more than their fair share of flood insurance premium.</p>\n<p>Risk Rating 2.0 takes into account new ways of understanding flood risk through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private sector data sets.</li>\n<li>Improved catastrophe models.</li>\n<li>Advanced actuarial practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, the new rating methodology reduces rates in areas with less risk for flooding and increases them for areas where floods are more likely. That’s why FEMA refers to Risk Rating 2.0 as “equity in action.”</p>\n<p>The rollout for Risk Rating 2.0 began on October 1, 2021 for new policies and policies up for renewal. Starting on April 1, 2022, the remaining policies will be subject to the new rating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatriskrating20isnotchanging\">What Risk Rating 2.0 Is Not Changing</h2>\n<p>Even though its rating system is changing, FEMA is keeping some elements, particularly those that are required by law. Perhaps the most important of these is the maximum annual price increase of 18 percent for most rates. Flood insurance rate increases will be gradual and always within the mandatory 18 percent cap where it applies.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the FEMA insurance program that won’t change is the use of FIRMs to determine who is required to buy <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. FIRMs will also continue to be used to develop floodplain management building requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, areas that participate in the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management/community-rating-system\">Community Rating System</a> will still be eligible for discounts between 5 and 45 percent based on the community’s classification. Because Risk Rating 2.0 doesn’t use <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a> to determine flood risk, the discounts will be applied uniformly to all policyholders within the community. This means homeowners in Special Flood Hazard Areas may also qualify for discounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidnfipfloodinsurancerateincreases\">How to Avoid NFIP Flood Insurance Rate Increases</h2>\n<p>The most important step you can take to avoid a flood insurance rate increase is to pay attention to your policy’s expiration date. NFIP policies do not automatically renew. Instead, the NFIP sends a renewal notice by mail, and then you contact the entity that sold you your policy. The notice should include any changes to your premium.</p>\n<p>If your renewal notice indicates a significant increase, then you may want to start shopping for private flood insurance. We suggest getting several quotes so you can compare what’s available from private flood insurance providers to the NFIP’s renewal terms.</p>\n<p>For example, you may want to check out our flood insurance endorsement that you can add to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Premiums start at just $175 per year, and the coverage limits are higher than what an NFIP policy usually offers.</p>"

    body: "<p>Florida regularly sits near the top of the list when it comes to home insurance costs. The average annual premium in the state is over $4,000 – or nearly three times the national average, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III).</p>\n<p>That’s enough to create serious sticker shock if you’re a first-time buyer, but Floridians may feel even more dismay come renewal time. The III also reports the average percentage increase for home insurance across the state is 30%.</p>\n<p>Please note that <a href=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/ica/2022propertyinsurancechanges\">recent special legislative sessions</a> addressed several of the issues Florida’s property insurance market faces. We hope these new laws will provide our Florida homeowners some relief from the rising cost of insurance. However, the impact might not be felt immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howarehomeownersinsuranceratesdeterminedinflorida\">How are homeowners insurance rates determined in Florida?</h2>\n<p>As a member-owned insurance company, we want our policyholders to understand what goes into determining fair rates. Some of the laws governing insurance rates in Florida are unique and strict. For example, Florida property insurers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can’t just charge whatever rates they want.</li>\n<li>Can’t exceed a maximum profit of 4.2%.*</li>\n<li>Must set rates that cover reinsurance costs and the number of claims they expect.</li>\n<li>Must get any proposed rate changes approved by Florida’s insurance regulator.</li>\n<li>Must prove that any requested rate change is fair and necessary.**</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also strive to meet our members’ needs by providing home insurance at as low a price as possible while still ensuring we have the financial ability to pay claims and serve our members for years to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatscausingfloridahomeownersinsuranceratestoincrease\">What’s causing Florida homeowners insurance rates to increase?</h2>\n<p>The reasons Florida homeowners insurance rates are going up are complex, but they all point to one general culprit: rising costs. Insurance companies exist to protect customers from the high cost of a devastating loss. But over time their rates have to be higher than their costs, or the insurance companies wouldn't have any capital left.</p>\n<p>In fact, several well-known insurance companies have already gone insolvent or stopped selling home insurance in Florida because of this struggle, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FedNat Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>St. Johns Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>United Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Gulfstream Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Southern Fidelity Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Bankers Insurance Group.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what’s happening in Florida that pushes home insurance rates so high? The reasons are complicated, but we’ve broken them down into five categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinsurance</li>\n<li>Insurance fraud</li>\n<li>Litigation costs</li>\n<li>Catastrophic claims</li>\n<li>Inflation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just about every state has issues with each of these to some extent, but Florida is currently struggling with all of them. Combine these with <a href=\"faq/home-insurance-fees/\">fees assessed by the Florida Insurance Guarantee Association</a> (FIGA) in October 2021 and May 2022, and you can see why Florida homeowners insurance rates are on the rise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reinsurancerisingforall\">Reinsurance rising for all</h2>\n<p>The most important factor contributing to Florida’s rising home insurance rates are recent <a href=\"https://www.artemis.bm/news/reinsurance-rates-need-to-catch-up-at-june-july-2022-renewals/\">increases in reinsurance costs</a>. Essentially insurance for an insurance company, <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">reinsurance</a> is a necessary part of an insurer’s ability to pay claims ﹘ particularly in catastrophe-prone states like Florida. But sometimes the cost of reinsurance goes up, and when it does, so will homeowners insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Reinsurance cost went down between 2006 and 2017, in part because there weren’t many major storms in Florida. But recently, bigger storms have caused bigger losses, and that’s caused the <a href=\"https://www.artemis.bm/global-property-cat-rate-on-line-index/\">cost of reinsurance to increase</a>. In just the first part of January, reinsurance rates in the U.S. went up between <a href=\"https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20230110/NEWS06/912354781/Property-insurance-rates-to-keep-surging-in-2023\">45% and 100%</a>. That’s a cost home insurance companies have to cover when they set their rates.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Florida legislature passed bills to create the Reinsurance to Assist Policyholders Fund (RAP Fund) and the <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Committees/BillSummaries/2022A/html/2878\">Florida Optional Reinsurance Program</a> (FORA). The RAP Fund provides some reinsurance to insurers for free, but only in either 2022 or 2023. FORA, on the other hand, is an optional program that lets insurers purchase coverage at reasonable rates. However, the amount of coverage from these programs is limited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcatastrophicclaimsimpactfloridahomeownersinsurancerates\">How catastrophic claims impact Florida homeowners insurance rates</h2>\n<p>More catastrophic claims cause reinsurance costs to rise, but they also directly impact the <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a>. Essentially, Florida insurance companies must price policies so that they have enough money to cover claims expected from catastrophic losses such as hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Because Florida has the highest risk of catastrophe of any state, <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> typically costs more than the national average. And unfortunately, climate change <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">causes more severe hurricanes</a>. This increases the chance of lots of homeowners experiencing claims all at once, forcing home insurance companies to raise rates to cover the potential claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurancefraudandhomeinsuranceratesinflorida\">Insurance fraud and home insurance rates in Florida</h2>\n<p>While increasing reinsurance costs is the main driver of Florida’s home insurance rate increases, litigation costs are another issue Florida insurance companies have to contend with when pricing <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. And that problem is compounded by fraud, particularly insurance scams involving <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignments of benefits</a> (AOB) and repairs. The scenarios usually go like this:</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario1manufactureddamage\">Scenario 1: Manufactured damage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A contractor sends a solicitation or knocks on an insured’s door saying that he or she has been able to get a “free new roof” for neighbors in the area and they’d like to inspect the insured’s roof</li>\n<li>The contractor goes on the roof and creates “damage” with a hammer or other method</li>\n<li>The contractor tells the insured that they have damage from a prior storm and that the contractor can get them a new roof from the insurance company</li>\n<li>The contractor submits an insurance claim</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"scenario2inflateddamage\">Scenario 2: Inflated damage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A homeowner calls a contractor to fix roof damage.</li>\n<li>The contractor has the homeowner sign an assignment of benefits contract that allows the contract to manage the claim directly with the insurer.</li>\n<li>The contractor inflates the cost of repairs and sues the insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The cost of bad actors and third parties filing false or inflated insurance claims is passed along to all of us,” according to Florida’s Insurance Consumer Advocate. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates insurance fraud costs over <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud\">$40 billion per year</a>. That translates into approximately $700 to $800 in increased annual premium per family.</p>\n<p>And there’s no free lunch when it comes to insurance fraud – the cost almost always gets passed on to homeowners. That’s why we ask our members to help mitigate rate increases by contacting us directly if they have a claim and avoiding attempts by third parties to generate or inflate claims.</p>\n<p>In the December 2022 special session, Florida legislators <a href=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/ica/2022propertyinsurancechanges\">passed a law</a> that could help reduce instances of insurance fraud. Senate Bill 2A (SB 2A) prohibits the assignment of benefits signed on or after January 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>But that date means claims from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole aren’t affected. Those claims are still coming in, so insurers may still be paying for AOB-related insurance fraud.</p>\n<p>The May 2022 special session also brought about a law designed to reduce fraud. Senate Bill 4D (SB 4D) intends to curb contractors’ ability to solicit policyholders by prohibiting contractors from encouraging policyholders to contact a contractor or public adjuster to make a roof claim unless the communication includes the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The policyholder is responsible for paying the deductible.</li>\n<li>It’s insurance fraud for the contractor to pay or waive an insurance deductible.</li>\n<li>Filing a claim with false, misleading, or fraudulent information is insurance fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"litigationcostspassedontopolicyholders\">Litigation costs passed on to policyholders</h2>\n<p>Ever wonder why Florida has so many attorney advertisements on television and billboards that are focused specifically on suing insurance companies? Until the special session this past December, Florida’s incredibly high rate of insurance litigation was driven by a unique Florida law.</p>\n<p>The law, F.S. sec 627.428, created a situation of “one-way attorney fees.” Basically, plaintiff attorneys were rewarded for filing lawsuits against insurance companies without any counterbalancing risk that these attorneys could owe legal costs if their lawsuits are unsuccessful. Because of this, Florida had <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/04/14/609721.htm\">over 76% of home insurance lawsuitst</a>, but only 8% of homeowners claims.</p>\n<p>Worse? Between 2013 and 2020, Florida property and casualty insurers paid $15 billion in claims costs, but only <a href=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/12/28/florida-personal-lines-coverage-reaches-crisis-levels-part-1/\">8% of that went to consumers</a>. Lawyers fees, however, accounted for 71%.</p>\n<p>SB 2A repeals one-way attorney fees. Each party is now responsible for their own attorney fees in many property insurance lawsuits, with a few exceptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inflationhitseveryone\">Inflation hits everyone</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest factors in determining the insurance rate for an individual home is the amount of money it would take to replace that home if it were destroyed. This is currently being significantly impacted by inflation.</p>\n<p>The supply chain issues that plague other industries also impact Florida homeowners insurance rates. Take the cost of lumber for an example. Limited supplies coupled with high demand <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">forced lumber prices to skyrocket in 2021</a>. In turn, those prices drove up homes’ <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimates</a>. And if your home costs more to replace, then your home insurance is going to cost more too.</p>\n<p>Between January 2021 and January 2022, residential reconstruction costs in Florida <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/insurance/gated-resources/360value-quarterly-cost-updates/\">went up 12.4%</a> as of April, according to insurance software company Value360. While that’s not the highest in the country, it does add to increasing Florida homeowners insurance rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whataboutfiga\">What about FIGA?</h2>\n<p>Finally, Florida homeowners are also being hit with an additional fee from the Florida Insurance Guarantee Association (FIGA). This is the state-sanctioned organization dedicated to protecting insurance consumers in the event an <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> is unable to meet its obligations. To do this, FIGA periodically requires its members to collect fees from their policyholders.</p>\n<p>The current 1.3% assessment, ordered on March 11, 2022, is specifically linked to St. Johns Insurance Company entering into receivership, according to a <a href=\"https://figafacts.com/assessments\">statement put out by FIGA</a>. This is on top of a prior 0.70% fee assessed on October 11, 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcanhomeownersdotoreduceinsurancerates\">What can homeowners do to reduce insurance rates?</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, the Florida state government is looking to make home insurance more affordable. In the meantime, there are ways for you to reduce your homeowners insurance premiums. For instance, you might want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask for discounts.</strong> Every insurance carrier has its own list of discounts, so find out what your insurer offers so you can take advantage of as many as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Raise your deductible.</strong> Increasing your deductible often lowers your premium. However, you want to be sure you pick a deductible you can afford to pay.</li>\n<li><strong>Take part in My Safe Florida Home.</strong> This program, which was bolstered by SB 2D, provides homeowners with funds for hurricane mitigation inspections and home-strengthening improvements. You can see if you’re eligible at the <a href=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\">My Safe Florida Home website</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Install wind mitigation features.</strong> Even if you’re not eligible for My Safe Home Florida, you may want to look into hardening your home against wind damage. The right window coverings and roof ties can make a big difference in a storm and could earn you a discount.</li>\n<li><strong>Install security devices.</strong> Deterring crime is a good way to minimize claims, and that can help you lower your home insurance costs in the long run.</li>\n<li><strong>Call your insurance company first.</strong> Don’t fall prey to fraudulent contractors or other parties who may create or inflate a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Comparing rates from multiple insurance companies is also a good way to get affordable coverage. Just be sure you look at the entire offer, not just the price.

    body: "<p>Just the thought of your home and belongings being destroyed by floodwater is enough to fill any homeowner with dread. But don’t worry! If you live in an area prone to storms and heavy rainfall, chances are you already have a crucial appliance in your home that’s got your back. Let us introduce you to the almighty sump pump.</p>\n<p>Sump pumps are devices placed at the lowest point of your house (typically a basement or crawlspace) and are designed to protect the foundation of your home and keep it from flooding. They use sensors to detect elevated water levels and move water away from your home through — you guessed it — an underground pump.</p>\n<p>Do sump pumps need maintenance? You bet they do! As you can imagine, this appliance is an essential part of keeping your home safe after storms or heavy rainfall. You need to keep this appliance in good working order, which means that regular sump pump servicing is crucial.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll discuss <em>why</em> upkeep is so important, as well as <em>how</em> to maintain sump pumps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimportanceofregularsumppumpmaintenance\">The importance of regular sump pump maintenance</h2>\n<p>Sump pump maintenance, not to be confused with sewage pump maintenance, is crucial for a variety of reasons. If these pumps stop working correctly, your basement could flood and cause serious damage to your home.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the purpose your sump pump serves. Your sump pump also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protects your home’s foundation.</li>\n<li>Prevents paint and wallpaper from peeling.</li>\n<li>Improves circulation and air flow in basements.</li>\n<li>Protects basement appliances from corrosion, like washers, dryers and freezers.</li>\n<li>Reduces fungus growth in basements, like mold and mildew.</li>\n<li>Reduces insect infestations, like termites and millipedes.</li>\n<li>Checks a box for flood insurance coverage requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just some of the perks of a functioning sump pump! As you can see, regular maintenance is important, and you should invest in a sump pump inspection at least once per year. If you live in an area with frequent heavy rainfall or snow, you may need to schedule quarterly sump pump maintenance service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6sumppumpmaintenancetips\">6 sump pump maintenance tips</h2>\n<p>While having a professional come out for regular sump pit maintenance is crucial, there are also things you can do to make sure you’re staying on top of your sump pump’s health. Performing inspections yourself every three or four months can pinpoint problems before they morph into something much more severe.</p>\n<p>Here are six essential sump pump service and maintenance tips:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1knowyoursumppump\">1. Know your sump pump</h3>\n<p>Most people don’t know anything about sump pumps — and we don’t blame you! While you don’t need to know all the ins and outs of how your pump works, it may help to understand the basics so you can spot when something’s not right.</p>\n<p>The majority of the time, your sump pump is on standby, ready to jump into action. After heavy rainfall, groundwater from surrounding soil moves into the sump pit below your house and fills it with water. The sensors in your sump pump detect this pressure and rising water levels, and that activates your pump. It starts pumping the water out into a nearby storm drain or detention pond.</p>\n<p>There are two primary types of pumps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Submersible sump pumps</strong>, which can operate underwater so the motor will be positioned within the sump pit.</li>\n<li><strong>Pedestal sump pumps</strong>, which have the motor positioned above the pit and floor level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these differences, both kinds of sump pumps essentially function the same way and come with all the usual parts, ranging from the discharge pipe to the float switch.</p>\n<p>It also helps to know basic information about <em>your</em> specific sump pump, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your pump’s model and age.</li>\n<li>Where you can source replacement parts in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Any previously repaired issues you need to be aware of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sump pumps over seven years old are far more likely to experience problems than newer models. If you’ve purchased a new unit, make sure you have a physical and digital copy of the instruction manual. The instructions tell you how your pump works and this can give clues on what you need to watch out for. If you’re not sure which model you have, look for the model number on the motor. It will help you determine which pump you own and where to find a copy of an instruction manual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2performregulartests\">2. Perform regular tests</h3>\n<p>Just because you’re not a sump pump expert doesn’t mean you can’t learn to perform regular tests on your own. Trust us, when that huge storm hits, you’re going to want to make sure your sump pump is doing its job.</p>\n<p>It’s impossible to predict when water may begin to seep into your basement, so you want to make sure that your sump pump is functioning properly year-round. Luckily, testing this is pretty easy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the power is on and pour a small bucket of water into the sump pit.</li>\n<li>Monitor how the pump performs when it’s running and note any strange noises that could indicate a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it! Set yourself a reminder on your calendar to perform this test every month. If you know there’s a big storm coming, run the test a few times in the days before. It only takes a few minutes to do and it’s well worth it to save your home from permanent serious damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3recognizethesigns\">3. Recognize the signs</h3>\n<p>No one spends more time in your house than you do, which is why you’re the best person to monitor your sump pump. Knowing the most common signs of a problem is a key to good sump pump maintenance. You don’t need to know how to <em>fix</em> these problems, just how to <em>recognize</em> them so you can call in a professional.</p>\n<p>The most common signs of problems, and the issues they correspond to, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rattling or grinding.</strong> These noises occur due to damaged or jammed impellers. Other odd noises may indicate worn-out parts.</li>\n<li><strong>Excessive vibrations.</strong> If your motor is vibrating too much, the impeller could have become deformed or bent.</li>\n<li><strong>Turning on and off.</strong> The internal wiring may be damaged if your pump turns itself on and off randomly.</li>\n<li><strong>Oil leaks.</strong> Leaking oil typically indicates that your sump pump is coming to the end of its lifespan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these problems may indicate that your pump needs professional maintenance. In some cases, a professional may even recommend replacing the pump entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4deepcleanyoursumppump\">4. Deep clean your sump pump</h3>\n<p>As with most things, you can extend the lifespan of your sump pump by cleaning it regularly. Cleanliness increases its efficiency and keeps it performing at full potential. You want to deep clean your sump pump and pit regularly.</p>\n<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch off the pump. This step is very important. Trying to clean your sump pump while it’s connected to its power source is dangerous!</li>\n<li>Ensure that nobody is using any home appliances that could lead to water draining into the pump’s pit, such as the dishwasher or washing machine.</li>\n<li>Take a garden hose and rinse out the pump. If there’s any caked debris, remove it with a putty knife or plastic scraper.</li>\n<li>Use a wet vacuum to remove excess water from your sump pit.</li>\n<li>Wait until the pump has fully dried before reattaching your discharge pipe and plugging it back in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also discover that regular cleaning can alleviate some of the troubling signs we mentioned before. While it isn’t always the case, sometimes all your pump needs is a good cleaning!</p>\n<h3 id=\"5keepyourequipmentcovered\">5. Keep your equipment covered</h3>\n<p>Make sure you have a fitted covering for your sump pump. Basements are magnets for lint, debris, and sediment that could fall into the sump pit. A fitted covering protects your equipment from these as well as insects, and moisture-related problems. Plus it can prevent radon from seeping into your home. The covering should fit perfectly over the top, with the only holes being for the wiring.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that putting a cover over the top doesn’t negate the need for regular cleaning, but it can make the job much easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6inspectthedischargeline\">6. Inspect the discharge line</h3>\n<p>The last step in sump pump maintenance is to inspect the discharge line. If water is draining slowly and your pump is working fine, you may have an issue with your drainage pipes. Carefully remove any blockages you can see. If the problem persists, then you need to call a professional.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourhomewithkininsurance\">Protect your home with Kin Insurance</h2>\n<p>Every homeowner knows that water damage is one of the most severe threats to your home’s foundation. While a sump pump works hard to protect your house, the right equipment doesn’t negate the need for insurance.

    body: "<p>If you own a home in Florida and you feel like you’re paying more for your homeowners insurance than your friends and family around the country, you’re not imagining things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> does cost more than insurance in most of the rest of the country. In fact, the only state where average <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a> are higher is Louisiana at an average of $1,968 per year.</p>\n<p>So what gives? Why are homeowners insurance rates in Florida so high? And more importantly: what can Florida homeowners do to manage those costs? Let’s find out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyfloridahomeownersinsurancecostssomuch\">Why Florida Homeowners Insurance Costs So Much</h2>\n<p>The short answer of why homeowners rates are higher in Florida is not complicated, and it’s probably what you expected: Florida has a higher risk of expensive weather-related catastrophes than most other states in the nation.</p>\n<p>Because Florida sits between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, it has catastrophe exposure on both its east and west coasts (most states don’t even <em>have</em> both an east and west coast!), from two different water bodies that have different weather patterns.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just the fact of catastrophes that pushes Florida insurance costs so high. It’s also the nature of those catastrophes. <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">Hurricanes</a> are unlike other types of damage in that they tend to cause serious damage to large geographical areas.</p>\n<p>For insurance companies, this makes it harder to manage risk: while a theft or house fire can cause serious damage to a single property, a hurricane is likely to harm an entire town. That means an insurance company will likely have lots of claims at the same time, which is both expensive and logistically hard to manage.</p>\n<p>Because of this difficult-to-manage risk, many insurance companies have stopped writing homeowners policies in Florida (or never got into the state to start with). This can drive costs up even more: fewer carriers in the marketplace means less competition, which means higher prices (see Figure 1).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/FL%20Expensive%20Rates.png?width=1938&name=FL%20Expensive%20Rates.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1: Reasons for high cost of homeowners insurance in Florida</em></p>\n<p>So the downside is there are underlying reasons Florida homeowners insurance rates are higher than other parts of the country. But the upside is that there are things Florida homeowners can do to reduce the amount they pay for homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howfloridahomeownerscanfindlowercostinsurance\">How Florida Homeowners Can Find Lower-Cost Insurance</h2>\n<p>We’ll break our cost-savings tips into two sections: tips for those who are currently on the market to buy a home and those who already own a home they plan to stay in for a while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifyoureshoppingforahome\">If you’re shopping for a home…</h3>\n<p>Good news: if you don’t yet own a home and you’re already aware of the high costs of Florida homeowners insurance, you're ahead of the game. Because you know what to be on the lookout for, you may be in a position to manage some of your costs from the get-go.</p>\n<p>As you’re looking at properties, be sure to ask your agent about the history of hurricanes in the area. They should have general information about which areas tend to be hit by storms and how badly. But don’t stop there. It’s also a good idea to take these measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review the seller’s disclosure</strong>. Sellers are required to tell you about past damage to the home. The only problem with this is that the seller may not be aware of damage that happened before their time.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask your insurance provider to pull a</strong> <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\"><strong>CLUE</strong></a> (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Evaluation) for any property you’re thinking of buying. This report will indicate whether the home has ever had insurance claims and can provide additional insight into a seller’s disclosure, especially if the seller hasn’t lived at the property long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Knowing how badly a property was hit by major storms in the past can help you know what to expect in the future – such as high homeowners insurance premiums. It can also help you understand if the property has a history of flooding; if it does, you’ll want to purchase a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policy in addition to your standard homeowners policy, as flood coverage is not included in standard homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to know more about the <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida Homestead Exemption</a> and if you can apply for the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifyouplantostayinyourcurrenthomeforawhile\">If you plan to stay in your current home for a while…</h3>\n<p>If you already have a home and you’re hoping to lower the cost of your homeowners insurance, there are several steps you can take to make that happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update your property so it’s more resilient to storm damage</strong>. In Florida, that typically means making <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind-mitigation</a> upgrades, making sure you have a <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">working sump pump</a> with a backup power source, and mending any external cracks that might let in water. Many insurance companies offer lower rates to homeowners whose properties are best prepared to weather storm damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Check out new home insurance options</strong>. While options may be limited in Florida, it’s still a good idea to see what’s available before renewing your existing policy. Not sure what to look at when you shop around? Check out our <a href=\"/blog/how-to-compare-home-insurance/\">tips for comparing home insurance policies</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Compare premium and deductible costs</strong>. In most cases, opting for a higher policy deductible will yield lower monthly premium costs. Of course, this means that in the event of a claim, you’ll have to pay more out of pocket than you would with a lower premium. Be sure you have a clear understanding of what you’ll be expected to pay before choosing a higher deductible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"protiptrykin\">Pro Tip: Try Kin</h2>\n<p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention that you should consider buying your insurance from us. In fact, <a href=\"/about/\">we founded Kin </a>with the goal of making homeowners insurance more affordable for Florida residents. Today, we’re making that happen via three strategies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reinsurance</strong>. Without getting into the nitty gritty too much, this means we’ve found ways to manage the risk we face internally when major storms hit. So even in the event of a huge disaster, we’ll be able to deliver the service and care – not to mention coverage – our customers expect.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct-to-you model</strong>. We don’t sell Kin policies through agents, which means we don’t have to maintain costly storefronts. And that means we save a lot of money. We pass those savings along to you.</li>\n<li><strong>More data</strong>. A typical homeowners insurance policy uses 30 to 40 data points to evaluate a home’s risk. At Kin, we use thousands. This lets us make more granular risk assessments based on your actual property – not the general neighborhood or area you live in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If our rates aren’t the lowest available, we’ll help you shop around and make an apples-to-apples comparison on your choices. That’s only fair to you.</p>\n<p>In short, do what you can to make your home more resilient to storms and be sure to see what’s out there when it’s time to renew. Your options may surprise you.</p>"

    body: "<p>Have you noticed the electricity in the air? The birds singing with extra gusto? The Gulf sparkling brighter than usual?</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence. Today is a cause for celebration: <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/kin_now_offering_homeowners_policies_in_louisiana/prweb17808298.htm\">Kin has officially arrived in Louisiana</a>!</p>\n<p>We built Kin back in 2016 with our hearts set on one goal: to change homeowners insurance for the better. Since then, we’ve prioritized serving states that need easy, affordable home insurance the most. Perhaps no one knows how important that mission is more than Louisiana homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywechoselouisianaasournextstop\">Why we chose Louisiana as our next stop</h2>\n<p>Louisiana is currently one of the most expensive states in the US for homeowners insurance, thanks to its history of hurricanes and its rapidly disappearing coastline. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes\">843,349 Louisiana single-family homes</a> are vulnerable to a Category 5 hurricane.</p>\n<p>We can’t change the weather, but we can change how insurance is done.</p>\n<p>Picture it: what if instead of ignoring increasingly severe weather for as long as possible, your insurance provider actually helped you prepare for the weather to come? What if instead of increasing prices exponentially, your insurance company got smarter with data and risk modeling to help you save money?</p>\n<p>That’s our whole approach: we use data and technology to make homeowners insurance work for you, not the other way around. The result? You can often save more on home insurance with Kin, even if your home usually has a hard time getting covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ourfavoritethingsaboutlouisiana\">Our favorite things about Louisiana</h2>\n<p>To celebrate our launch in the state, we asked our team to share their favorite things about Louisiana. And yes, nearly everyone said New Orleans, but who can blame them.</p>\n<p>In no particular order, we are smitten with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The icons.</strong> Louisiana is the birthplace of jazz, Louis Armstrong, Brittney Spears, Lead Belly, Anne Rice, Lucinda Williams, Big Freedia, Lil Wayne, and DJ Khaled.</li>\n<li><strong>The festivals.</strong> Mardi Gras (of course), the Louisiana Catfish Festival, the Tennessee Williams / New Orleans Literary Festival, Christmas Eve bonfires on the levee, and the annual Alligator Festival in St. Charles Parish. Even during COVID, Yardi Gras was in full swing, with more than 3,000 homes transformed into stationary “floats.”</li>\n<li><strong>The alligators.</strong> Louisiana has one of the highest alligator populations in the country: an estimated 2 million in the wild and another 300,000 on alligator farms.</li>\n<li><strong>The food.</strong> King cakes. Beignets. Barbeque. Gumbo, étouffée, jambalaya, and po’boys. We could go on, but now we’re hungry.</li>\n<li><strong>The sights.</strong> The French Quarter, Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, National WWII Museum, Avery Island Tabasco Museum, and Congo Square, to name a few.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"faqsaboutourlouisianahomeownersinsurance\">FAQs about our Louisiana homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>At this point, we’re sure you’ve got all kinds of questions about what we do and how we make life easier for the homeowners we insure.

    body: "<p>Over 58,000 wildfires burned 7.1 million acres in the US in 2021, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. One year prior, a similar number of fires burned more than 10 million acres. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate we’re in for much of the same in 2022.</p>\n<p>Living in an area with wildfire risk means you need to take steps to protect your home and family. So let’s take a closer look at these reports and what you can do to be prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"predictionsforuswildfireseason2022\">Predictions for US wildfire season 2022</h2>\n<p>A report from Zesty.ai, <a href=\"https://content.zesty.ai/wildfire-season-overview-2022/#lp-pom-image-20\">A Data-Driven Conversation About Wildfire Risk in 2022</a>, claims that large areas of the US will have a wildfire season similar to 2020 and 2021 – two of the worst wildfire years on record. For example, California, the state with the lion’s share of wildfires, had a particularly devastating season in 2021 where wildfires destroyed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.5 million acres.</li>\n<li>3,629 structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The previous year, 2020, was even worse with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.3 million acres burned.</li>\n<li>11,116 structures destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drought patterns in California, the primary driver of wildfire risk, are nearly the same in 2022 as they were in 2020 and 2021. The report goes on to list several other states where drought increases the chance for wildfires to this year.</p>\n<p>Another report, <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/accuweather-2022-us-wildfire-forecast/1178642\">this one from AccuWeather</a>, echoes the Zesty.ai predictions, anticipating an “intense” wildfire season that could see 68,000 to 72,000 fires and 8.1 to 8.3 million acres burned. In fact, wildfires had already burned more than 1.1 million acres as of May 3, 2022. That’s double the acreage burned by that date last year.</p>\n<p>Historically, wildfire season sits between the months of July and October, when vegetation is at its driest, and temperatures are at their peak. But as we’ve discussed in previous posts, experts now believe that <a href=\"/blog/wildfire-season-is-year-round/\">wildfire season is year-round</a> – especially in the drought-ridden states out West.</p>\n<h3 id=\"climatechangeandwildfireswhatstheconnection\">Climate change and wildfires: What’s the connection?</h3>\n<p>The general consensus in the science community is that climate change is a <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-climate-change/\">key factor in increasing wildfire risk</a>. The ideal situation for a wildfire includes hot temperatures, low soil moisture, and the presence of fuel (e.g., trees and shrubs). Climate change brings higher temperatures and more drought, and the dryer conditions make it easier for fires to start and harder to put out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewildfireriskisgreatest\">Where wildfire risk is greatest</h2>\n<p>Areas with the worst drought conditions have the most wildfire risk. According to the Zesty.ai report, property owners in these states have the most concern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California</li>\n<li>Oregon</li>\n<li>New Mexico</li>\n<li>Texas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the Accuweather report lists additional areas with increased wildfire risk, such as Southern Florida. Western Oklahoma, and parts of North and South Carolina.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverwildfirerisk\">Does home insurance cover wildfire risk?</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> usually covers wildfire risk. Depending on where you live and who your insurance company is, you may be required to create a foliage-free barrier between your home and the grass, trees, and shrubs that surround it. This <a href=\"/blog/defensible-space/\">defensible space</a>, which can be anywhere from 30 to 100 feet, helps reduce the chance of a fire spreading to your home.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> do not cover wildfire risk in some areas. Moreover, some may adjust their underwriting of homes in wildfire zones if the risk continues to increase. This is why it’s important to review your home insurance every year to see if any changes affect your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhomefromwildfires\">How to protect your home from wildfires</h2>\n<p>While your home insurance is there to protect you if you do experience a wildfire, you also want to prevent a loss in the first place. The first step is to create a defensible space which means you should <a href=\"/blog/brush-removal-for-fire-prevention/\">remove brush for fire prevention</a>.</p>\n<p>Another big problem for homes in wildfire areas are embers, so cover attic vents with a fine, metal mesh to prevent embers from entering. Open eaves can be a problem too. The eaves are the section of your roof that extends over the exterior walls. If you can see beams in the eaves, then embers can get caught in your eaves and start your house on fire. Debris in your gutters and on your roof can also increase your fire risk.</p>\n<p>Essentially, look around your home for places where embers might enter and seal them off. These and other <a href=\"/blog/fire-prevention-for-homeowners/\">fire prevention tips</a> can help keep your home and family safe.</p>"

    body: "<p>“We don’t even call it a season anymore. There’s no such thing as a fire season,” Scott McLean, Cal Fire's Deputy Chief of Communications, said in an interview with Yahoo News. “Right now, we’re looking at a fire year. We’re having fires every month of the year.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"whytheresnowildfireseasonanymore\">Why there’s no wildfire season anymore</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a>’s wildfire season typically peaks from May to October, but with every passing year, this timeframe becomes more and more obsolete. Many experts argue there is no longer a single season for wildfires; the risk is year-round in the dry, open spaces of the West. The Camp fire, for example, started on November 8, 2018. It took <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/16/20908291/camp-fire-wildfire-california-paradise-survivors\">17 days</a> to contain.</p>\n<p>While the winter months bring some moisture and make fires less likely and more manageable, it doesn’t stop them from igniting completely. Let’s take a look at why wildfire season is now year round.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1climatechangeiscausingmoredroughts\">1. Climate change is causing more droughts</h2>\n<p>Many parts of the Earth have new normal temperatures <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/\">2.7 degrees Fahrenheit higher</a> than pre-industrial levels. That might not seem like much, but that amount of warming creates a lot of change: heat waves, droughts, water shortages, extreme precipitation, rising sea levels, and fires, to name a few.</p>\n<p>These rising temperatures are the reason California has seen <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/06/weather/california-record-temperature/index.html\">record high temperatures</a> and is still experiencing <a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/states/california\">moderate to extreme droughts in 68 percent of the state</a>. Lack of moisture increases fuel flammability and availability, making a clear link between <a href=\"https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/8/\">increased drought and increased fire risk</a>. Drier conditions also increase forest pests, such as the mountain pine beetle, that can weaken or kill trees. Dead trees become ready-to-burn fuel.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse for Californians, the <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-climate-change/\">Center for Climate and Energy Solutions</a> notes a 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (or 1 degree Celsius) increase could increase the median forest area burned per year by 600 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2theresalotoffuelformassivefires\">2. There’s a lot of fuel for massive fires</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/tree_mortality/california/index.shtml\">Tree mortality in California</a> is at an all-time high thanks to climate change, unprecedented drought, high tree densities, and a bark beetle infestation. Since 2010, California’s national forests have an estimated <strong>129 million dead trees</strong>, many near communities, campgrounds, trails, and power lines.</p>\n<p>That’s ready-made fuel that even the tiniest spark can ignite. Wildfire behavior depends on fuel, weather, and topography. The extreme heat this summer caused more thunderstorms and lightning strikes, offering the initial spark for many fires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3wildfiresarespreadingfaster\">3. Wildfires are spreading faster</h2>\n<p>Not only is it easier for wildfires to start in dry conditions, but they spread faster, too. For proof, look at the CZU Lightning Complex fire in California that began in August 2020. It <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-30/why-californias-2020-lightning-fires-have-grown-bigger-and-faster-than-any-in-state-history\">quadrupled in size in just one day</a>. The SCU and LNU Lightning Complex fires are the second- and third-largest blazes ever recorded in California.</p>\n<p>In September 2020, fire officials in California’s Sierra National Forest dealt with the Labor Day weekend fires that spread through <a href=\"https://apnews.com/dc30bcead69e5b67004711b78bbda868\">15 miles of forestland in one day</a>.</p>\n<p>In the same week, the North Complex fire in Plumas National Forest <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/10/western-fires-fatalities-homes/\">spread 25 miles</a> in one day, consuming <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2020-09-11-western-wildfires-evacuations-oregon-california-washington\">394 square miles of forest lands</a>. Again, hotter temperatures and millions of dead trees helped fuel the blaze.</p>\n<p>And it’s not only acreage that’s in jeopardy – many homes and communities are nestled near the forest and may not have much notice when they need to evacuate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4wildfiresaregettinghardertocontain\">4. Wildfires are getting harder to contain</h2>\n<p>Wildfires are getting more difficult to put out in part because of the abundance of ladder fuels in overgrown forests. These are low-lying tree branches, shrubs, and small and medium trees under the canopy of larger trees. Once a slow-burning surface fire on the ground reaches these ladder fuels, fires can spread rapidly to the entire top canopy. When those big trees are burning, embers blown by the wind can ignite neighboring trees and can be spread further downwind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/the-science-of-wildfires-why-theyre-getting-more-extreme/312B800E-9603-4BBB-8C8C-80503A120D21.html\">Ladder fuels played a key role</a> in the 2018 Camp fire, which blazed through the entire town of Paradise.</p>\n<p>Parts of Northern California also witnessed <a href=\"/blog/fire-tornadoes/\">fire tornadoes</a> this summer. These vortices of flame are formed through extreme heat, uneven terrain, and turbulent winds. Because they create their own weather system, fire tornadoes can be incredibly hard to combat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5currentfirecontrolpolicyisnthelpingandhumansarenteither\">5. Current fire control policy isn’t helping – and humans aren’t, either</h2>\n<p>Fire suppression (putting out fires as soon as they start) is the go-to strategy for land managers, but it interrupts the natural burning cycle. Research shows <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/the-science-of-wildfires-why-theyre-getting-more-extreme/312B800E-9603-4BBB-8C8C-80503A120D21.html\">20 percent of California</a> would benefit from fuel treatments: logging or clearing brush, prescribed burns, and letting wildfires in uninhabited areas run their course under supervision.</p>\n<p>Plus, more people are living in communities against landscapes that have a lot of wildfire activity. Fires are incredibly hard to contain in this region. New housing construction in fire-prone areas means more people will be at risk when fires begin.</p>\n<p>Humans aren’t doing their part to stave off fires, either. Many fires start by human negligence, like pyrotechnics used in a gender reveal announcement, which started the <a href=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7148/55832/\">September 7, 2020, El Dorado Fire</a> that burned more than 14,000 acres.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingfireresilience\">Building fire resilience</h2>\n<p>To protect yourself and your home from wildfires, wildfire insurance is a must. You can also do your part in your community to reduce the likelihood and impact of wildfires by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting against residential development near fire-prone forests.</li>\n<li>Clearing brush and trees near your home.</li>\n<li>Remodeling with fire-resistant design features and materials.</li>\n<li>Making a fire safety plan for your family.</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<p>Florida has had a rough start to spring this year with a barrage of wildfires hitting the state. As of March 11, 2022, the Sunshine State has witnessed nearly 70 wildfires that burned over 36,000 acres. The worst wildfires in Florida so far were three in the Panhandle that burned more than 34,000 acres together.</p>\n<p>Wildfires may not be the first risk people associate with Florida homes, but they are a historical issue in the state. Florida sees fires on a <a href=\"https://www.sjcemergencymanagement.com/wfdepth.html\">three- to five-year cycle</a>, partly due to the tropical atmosphere that puts the state at the top of the list for lightning strikes. Worse, the risk for wildfires may be increasing with climate change. One of the results of more severe hurricanes is more dead vegetation to act as wildfire fuel.</p>\n<p>While you can’t completely protect your home from a wildfire, you take steps to reduce your risk. That starts with fireproofing your home and ends with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> that helps you recover if your home is damaged in a wildfire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofireproofyourhomefromwildfires\">How to fireproof your home from wildfires</h2>\n<p>Let’s be clear: you can’t completely fireproof your home. That said, some homes are better prepared than others to withstand wildfires. Some ways you can better prepare your home for the worst-case scenario include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Installing a noncombustible roof.</strong> The American Society for Testing Methods is one organization that rates roofing materials. Class A denotes the most fire resistant and includes roof materials like concrete and clay tiles, flat or barrel-shaped tiles, and asphalt fiberglass composition shingles.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing eaves.</strong> Stand under the outer edge of your roof and check where it meets your home’s exterior. If you can see the rafter tails, then you may want to close your eaves with a noncombustible material.</li>\n<li><strong>Covering exterior vents.</strong> You can also prevent embers from getting inside your home by covering your exterior vents. Use metal wire mesh that is ⅛-inch or smaller, but also check with a contractor to make sure you aren’t restricting airflow.</li>\n<li><strong>Installing noncombustible exterior wall coverings.</strong> Just like your roof, you want your exterior walls to be fire resistant. Several <a href=\"/blog/house-siding-options/\">house siding options</a>, like metal sheeting, brick veneer, and stuccos, tend to resist fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Removing excess vegetation around the home.</strong> You want at least 30 feet of <a href=\"/blog/defensible-space/\">defensible space</a> between your house and brush. Gravel, brick, and concrete are good options for creating defensible space that reduces combustion risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing your gutters.</strong> We use this tip a lot, but keeping your gutters and roof free from debris like leaves and branches lowers the risk of your roof catching fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Enclosing your foundation.</strong> The <a href=\"/blog/types-of-foundations-for-homes/\">type of foundation</a> your home sits on can also protect against wildfires in Florida. Closing yours off can reduce your home’s exposure to embers. However, you want to weigh your chance for wildfire against your likelihood for floods and choose the foundation type that best protects against your biggest risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Making water accessible.</strong> An external sprinkler system with its own power source can protect your home if other water sources aren’t available. You might also want to invest in a garden hose that’s long enough to reach all parts of your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing out your windows.</strong> Single-pane windows are more likely to break when exposed to extreme heat, so opt for multi-pane windows, safety glass, or fireproof shutters.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps around exterior wall openings.</strong> Exterior walls often have holes for utility connections. Fill any gaps in these with fire-resistant caulk, mortar, or fire-protective expanding foam.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way to protect your home is to pay attention to the <a href=\"https://fireweather.fdacs.gov/wx/fdi-report.html\">wildfire risk</a> in your area. That way you can stay alert for any news that may impact your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverwildfiresinflorida\">Does homeowners insurance cover wildfires in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> covers damage to your home when it’s caused by wildfires. This is automatically part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures coverage</a>. Your policy also has <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> to help pay for damage to your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>But what happens if a wildfire in your area keeps you from returning to your home? How are those expenses covered?</p>\n<p>Whether that is covered depends on the situation. We’ve outlined a couple of examples below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your property is damaged to the extent that you can’t live in it, then you can file a claim for additional living expenses on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>If damage to your neighbor’s property and an authority, like the fire department, restricts access to your home, then you may receive approximately two weeks of civil authority coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note, however, that evacuations prior to damage are not covered by your home insurance, even when a civil authority calls for it.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned about wildfires in your area, talk to your Kin representative to make sure that you have enough coverage with your home insurance. Review your dwelling coverage, other structures, and personal belongings coverages to ensure that you have the right amount of if you experience a wildfire.</p>"

    body: "<p>The 2021 US homeownership rate <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/currenthvspress.pdf\">sits at 65.4 percent</a>, about two percentage points lower than third quarter of 2020. It makes you wonder: what's in store for 2022?</p>\n<p>There are a lot of economic factors at play in that equation –&nbsp;rising interest rates, inflation, and home prices, to name a few – and early predictions say 2022 will see a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/leading-economic-and-housing-experts-predict-multiple-fed-interest-rate-hikes-slowing-inflation-and-home-price-growth\">slight decrease in home sales as mortgage rates tick up</a>.</p>\n<p>But changes this year might make homeownership more accessible for some. In the summer of 2021, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae, started incorporating rental payments into its mortgage application. It believes this could help 17% of eligible first-time buyers qualify for a loan.</p>\n<p>The FHA also updated how it handles student loan debt and estimates that change will impact 45% of the first-time homebuyers who turn to it for loans.</p>\n<p>These changes may impact homeownership rates in 2022. Let's take a look at each in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaschangestostudentloandebt\">FHA’s changes to student loan debt</h2>\n<p>For years, the FHA required lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment as one percent of the outstanding balance if the loan wasn’t fully amortizing or in repayment. That requirement applied even to borrowers who were in approved forbearance or deferment and to those who had relatively small monthly payments under an income-based repayment plan.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this rule made it nearly impossible for many people carrying student loan debt to qualify for a mortgage. And it was particularly burdensome or people of color. According to the Education Data Initiative, Black college graduates owe on average <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race\">$25,000 more</a> than their white counterparts.</p>\n<p>But the FHA’s new rule allows lenders to base their calculations on borrowers’ actual monthly student loan payments, which is often lower than one percent of the total balance.</p>\n<p>This opens the door for many who had an unfavorable debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and is more in line with the FHA’s mission to help more first-time homebuyers get into a home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fanniemaetouserentalpayments\">Fannie Mae to use rental payments</h2>\n<p>Much like people with student loans found it difficult to qualify for an FHA loan, renters with limited credit histories were often frustrated when looking for a mortgage from Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p>As Melissa Gasparek of Inlanta Mortgage explains, “Because landlords do not report rent payments to credit bureaus, even renters with a flawless track record of on-time rent payments weren’t seeing any effect on or benefit to their credit scores.”</p>\n<p>But in August, <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners\">Fannie Mae announced</a> that if a first-time homebuyer has one year’s worth of on-time payments, they may now qualify for a home loan.</p>\n<p>The process begins when a lender submits the original loan application to its automated underwriting system. If the loan is not eligible, the system checks for a 12-month history of rental payments. If it finds evidence of this, the lender can get permission from the applicant to order an asset report from a Fannie Mae-approved vendor. That vendor then sends the new information to Fannie Mae, which may determine the customer is eligible for the loan.</p>\n<p>While this is a lengthy process, Fannie Mae estimates it can help 17% of originally ineligible borrowers get home loans. Moreover, using <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rental-pay-history-should-be-used-assess-creditworthiness-mortgage-borrowers\">rental payments to predict mortgage performance</a> is another important step toward equity in the housing market. According to Fannie Mae, about 20% of the population has a limited credit history, and people of color are disproportionately represented in that group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingintothehomebuyingprocess\">Getting into the home buying process</h2>\n<p>Even with these changes, remember that <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage basics</a> still apply, and that includes meeting other loan requirements.</p>\n<p>For example, Dino DiNenna of <a href=\"https://www.hiltonheadrealtysales.com/\">Hilton Head Realty</a> reminds people that they still want to “carry a credit score of 580 and have a down payment of 3.5%” to secure an FHA loan. And you’ll want to have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less in most cases.</p>\n<p>Essentially, follow all the normal <a href=\"/blog/first-time-home-buyer-tips/\">first-time buyer tips</a>, such as working to improve your credit and eliminating as much debt as possible.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about how the new rules affect you, talk to your mortgage representative.</p>"

    body: "<p>The national quarantine has changed every part of our daily lives. Here's how you can reestablish some normalcy in your workday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostayfocusedwhenworkingfromhomeduringapandemic\">How to Stay Focused When Working from Home during a Pandemic</h2>\n<p>Before coronavirus hit, there were an estimated 4.7 million U.S. workers working from home. Now in light of the pandemic, millions more are being asked – or volunteering – to work remotely in an effort to practice social distancing, stay at home, and “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/\">flatten the curve</a>.”</p>\n<p>Social distancing is meant to prevent the rampant <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-coronavirus/\">spread of COVID-19</a> by pausing crowds and gatherings. That’s because the disease, if left to spread unchecked, would tax our healthcare facilities to the point of chaos – we would not have enough personnel, supplies, or medical equipment to manage the influx of patients.</p>\n<p>So that’s the logic behind the national directive to practice social distancing for now. But how do you continue a normal work life if you’ve never <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-work-from-home/\">worked from home</a> before?</p>\n<p>Here are seven work from home productivity tips to help you navigate the new normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1getyourtechandworkspaceready\">1. Get Your Tech and Workspace Ready</h2>\n<p>Technology makes remote work possible, so bring your laptop, chargers, phone, mouse, keyboard, and monitors from your workplace if you’re able. Many employers will help accommodate your needs, so ask your supervisor or IT department for the equipment you need to do your work.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you also have access to the software or applications you need to do your job. Again, your IT department should be able to install or give you access to the applications you need, like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Office, Google Drive, etc.</p>\n<p>The other part of this equation is establishing physical space in your home as your work area. Choose a room or space away from common areas (like the kitchen) to minimize distractions, especially if your family, kids, or spouse are also home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2planyourworkday\">2. Plan Your Workday</h2>\n<p>Being in an office creates daily routines. Try to maintain those during your work-from-home days by blocking off time to get certain tasks done. For example, if you spend the first hour of your morning checking and responding to emails or returning phone calls, do that at home, too. Make sure to block off breaks and lunch just as you normally would and take them fully away from your laptop.</p>\n<p>It’s also smart to create a list at the beginning of each day to establish what you want to accomplish. Don’t just assume that the workday will be productive because you don’t have anyone in the office stopping by your desk to chat. Unblocked time and lack of clear daily goals can lead to procrastination or staring out the window indefinitely and wondering what comes next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keepyourmorningroutine\">3. Keep Your Morning Routine</h2>\n<p>We can’t stress this enough: sticking to your usual morning routines as much as possible can help create some sense of normalcy amidst the uncertainty. That might mean showering, getting dressed, walking the dog, and reading or listening to the news while you have a cup of coffee or tea.</p>\n<p>It can be easy to skip your routine, grab a coffee and bagel, and sit at the computer. However, the point of a routine is to help prepare you for your day. Don’t cut it short – it’s vital to getting your mind and body ready for work.</p>\n<p>And we’d be remiss if we didn’t include a quick note about pajamas. Do what makes you feel comfortable, but many seasoned remote workers strongly recommend getting dressed each day. You don’t have to dress in formal business attire, but forging the bathrobe and slippers can be a small gesture that subconsciously signals it’s time to work, not unwind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4havescheduledcheckinsandvideoconferences\">4. Have Scheduled Check-ins and Video Conferences</h2>\n<p>Quarantines can be a hard adjustment when you’re used to spending your workday with coworkers, especially if you live alone or aren’t able to visit your friends and family. One study says that an adult can have an average of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113687/\">12 social interactions</a> per day (not just at work), and it’s essential for mental and emotional health.</p>\n<p>Just because you’re working remotely doesn’t mean your work friendships need to fall by the wayside. In fact, your work friendships can help keep you productive by helping you talk through project challenges, allowing you to vent frustrations, or just forcing you to take a small break so your brain can regroup.</p>\n<p>Decide on a channel of communication, such as Hangouts, Slack, or texting, and schedule some online social time to decompress and interact.</p>\n<p>You can also coordinate with your coworkers or team to incorporate video conferences into your workday. Even digital face-to-face interactions can help everyone feel more connected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5feedyourbrain\">5. Feed Your Brain</h2>\n<p>Your brain needs fuel to help you stay productive and focused. Experts recommend <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/ss/slideshow-brain-foods-that-help-you-concentrate\">five things</a> in particular to help boost your concentration: blueberries, green tea, flax seeds, fatty fish, and water.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can still drink coffee. But don’t overdo it with the caffeine. Too much can cause <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-980/coffee\">nervousness and restlessness</a>, and there's already enough of that going around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6communicateoften\">6. Communicate Often</h2>\n<p>Good communication is the key to successfully working remotely, but it might be a skill that needs to be cultivated if you’re not used to this style of work. Stay in touch with your team or your manager – whether that’s through email or Slack – to align on goals and report on progress. Some remote teams find a brief end of day list that details what was accomplished helps keep everyone accountable and creates transparency into how time is being spent.</p>\n<p>Communication can also help you manage expectations. If your children are home and you are working while parenting, your productivity will probably not match your time in the office when the kids are in school.</p>\n<p>These are wild times that call for a little more understanding and empathy. Be open about your circumstance and what you can reasonably accomplish. Chances are your teammates are facing similar realities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7avoidhouseholddistractions\">7. Avoid Household Distractions</h2>\n<p>If you’re like procrastinators the world over, doing the laundry and cleaning the house will never seem more appealing than when you first start working from home.</p>\n<p>Pro tip: Don’t do it.</p>\n<p>Establish office hours and treat your home as though it were your workplace during that time frame. This means letting your now-homeschooled-children and/or significant other know you are working. It means ignoring chores as if you aren’t in the house. Just pretend you can’t see the mess until it’s time to clock out.</p>\n<p>By keeping office hours and not tackling home chores during your workday, you will be less likely to work intermittently for 12 hours. Get the work done and get back to living life.</p>\n<p>Remember: social distancing doesn’t mean you can’t step outside or walk the dog after work; just stay 6 feet away from other people. Getting some fresh air and stepping away from your computer can be a great way to keep your spirits up during this time. We’re all in this together and we’re gonna get through it.</p>"

    body: "<p>There's been a lot of chatter lately about the Florida home insurance market. And rightfully so – it's been in turmoil for a while. Our agents have heard about it directly from our members, but comments have also been spilling over into social media and other public forums.</p>\n<p>In our eyes, that’s a good thing! We want homeowners to be curious about insurance – both in terms of their coverage and the industry as a whole. Understanding how home insurance works is an important part of getting the right protection for any homeowners’ particular situation.</p>\n<p>To help homeowners get a better grip on what’s happening to Florida’s home insurance, our CEO Sean Harper participated in an Asking Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit. Most of the questions Redditors asked fell into three main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unique troubles in Florida’s homeowners insurance market.</li>\n<li>The rising costs of home insurance in Florida.</li>\n<li>How to keep home insurance premiums down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve already read our article on why <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida home insurance rates are going up</a>, then you know these topics are deeply intertwined. Let’s take a look at a few of Sean’s insights on these issues Florida homeowners brought up in his AMA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetroubledfloridahomeinsurancemarket\">The troubled Florida home insurance market</h2>\n<p>Far and away, the question that got the most attention during the AMA was “How soon will the entire homeowners insurance industry collapse because things are not looking good?”</p>\n<p>That’s an unsettling question, but it received 71 upvotes so people are clearly concerned about the situation in Florida.</p>\n<p>But there may be hope on the horizon. As Sean said, there’s a “huge incentive for everyone involved – politicians, regulators, insurance companies, consumers … to take action to avoid such a collapse.” More importantly, he thinks recent legislation, like <a href=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/Division/ICA/2022PropertyInsuranceChanges#2A\">Senate Bill 2A</a>, will be very helpful.</p>\n<p>While he’s confident these reforms will ultimately help Floridians, Sean believes that further work is necessary. He also expects prices to continue to increase and availability to remain stressed until the changes have had a chance to work.</p>\n<p>The reason? Both insurers and <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance/\">reinsurers</a> need data before they can act. Insurance and reinsurance are businesses that require a lot of capital, and the investors who provide it need to know they can get a positive return over time.</p>\n<p>Right now, the cost of capital for an insurance company is approximately 10% – perhaps even higher because the financial markets are so messy. If returns in the market are below that, then companies will likely shrink or go out of business. Above it, and you can start to attract new capital and new companies into the market.</p>\n<p>All said, Sean remained optimistic about the possibility for improvement: “[T]here have been periods of distress in homeowners insurance, and Florida homeowners insurance, but society has always found a way through.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepremiumsinflorida\">Home insurance premiums in Florida</h2>\n<p>High premiums for Florida homeowners insurance have been a problem for years now. Unfortunately, the combination of more extreme weather activity, increased losses across the state (largely the result of excessive litigation), and the cost of capital due to higher interest rates has created a “perfect storm” that pushes premiums even higher.</p>\n<p>One Redditor even noted their rates doubled after Hurricane Sally when they only had $2,800 in damage, and they said they paid $7,900 in total over four years prior with no claims.</p>\n<p>But as Sean pointed out, insurance premiums only consider your claims history to the extent it predicts your likelihood to file another claim. He explained that homeowners don’t have much control over the <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> that could cause a financial loss.</p>\n<p>“Your home could be hit by a hurricane, tornado, neighborhood fire, hailstorms, or earthquake and none of this would be in your control,” he said. “Given that these things are out of your control, your prior claims history plays no part on this portion of your premium’s calculation.”</p>\n<p>It’s also important to remember that the overall characteristics of a home play a big role in its insurance rates. The home’s location is important, but other factors come into play, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The type of home construction (e.g., concrete block versus wood).</li>\n<li>The home’s age.</li>\n<li>The roof’s age and type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Florida homeowners might feel better hearing that premium hikes aren’t their fault. But many are still frustrated with the high cost of insurance – like one Kin member who saw their premium go up by more than 100% at renewal time. That Redditor asked, “Is this a normal thing, for the first year to be essentially a bonus rate and bump up to a more normal rate from then on?”</p>\n<p>Sean assured the member that there aren’t different rates for new and renewal customers. Instead, the recent rate increase is a result of devastating storms that caused big jumps in both reinsurance and repair costs. Insurers are legally required to cover these expenses, so when they go up, so do premiums.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that “it personally feels really awful to raise rates on our members, especially because we have no choice … because our costs have increased. I interact with members who are frustrated every single day, and it stinks.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingcostsdownforfloridahomeinsurance\">Keeping costs down for Florida home insurance</h2>\n<p>So the impact from reforms is likely a way off, and homeowners are still paying high home insurance premiums. That led many of the Redditors taking part in the AMA to ask how they can bring their costs down.</p>\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive, Sean said, but ”we love helping members mitigate their own risk.” Safer homes are a win for everyone because members end up paying lower premiums, and Kin pays less for the reinsurance we need to insure their homes.</p>\n<p>Some suggestions from the AMA to help lower premiums include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mitigating your wind risk.</strong> According to Sean, “a large part of the overall premium is driven by hurricane risk,” so Floridians need to harden their homes against hurricanes by securing their roofs and protecting their windows from flying debris. Not only does this safeguard your home and reduce your hurricane-wind premium, but it could make you eligible for <a href=\"https://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/OIR-B1-1699.xls\">windstorm loss reduction credits</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacing older electrical panels.</strong> Certain brands of <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a> are more likely to catch fire. When our underwriters see this, we let the member know and tell them how to fix it.</li>\n<li><strong>Raising your deductible.</strong> Choosing a higher deductible usually means you have a lower premium. However, you’ll want to weigh what you might save against the reality of paying the higher deductible should you face a catastrophe.</li>\n<li><strong>Thinking about insurance when you shop for a home. “</strong>Homes that were built recently to modern code and are more inland haven’t been as adversely impacted by extreme weather as those closer to the water,” said Sean. He also encouraged homebuyers to identify their <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> and to budget for potential premium increases.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking about discounts.</strong> Like Sean said, safe homes are a win-win, so many insurance companies offer discounts for behavior that safeguards your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacing your roof.</strong> “Just like a lot of things, roofing material keeps getting better,” Sean said. Getting a new roof, installed by a good roofer, can save you money on insurance because most companies in Florida charge a lot more for older roofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Finding a policy with a</strong> <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\"><strong>roof schedule</strong></a> <strong>based on age.</strong> Your auto insurance doesn’t pay for a brand new car if you’re in a wreck. Similarly, Sean recommends getting home insurance that pays a specific percentage identified for your roof’s age. This can save you a lot of money, but it means your payout is lower if your roof is damaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should note that it wasn’t just Sean talking about how important the condition of your roof is to your insurance premiums. One Redditor backed him up by saying “The roof mitigation piece is huge. Our home was built with toe nails, but a quick <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">review of the proper connectors</a>, a hundred bucks at Home Depot, and a weekend crawling and hammering them up in the attic has saved me about $3,500 a year.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>The Florida home insurance market is tricky, to say the least, but there is reason for hope. As Sean said, “There was a healthy insurance market in Florida in the past, and if the legislature continues to pass legislation to address the problems, there will be again.”</p>\n<p>But one thing we really hope our members take away from Sean’s AMA is that we are really motivated to solve the issues surrounding home insurance in Florida. Homeowners in the state deserve better, and we think we’re a company that can bring them the insurance experience they’re entitled to.</p>"
