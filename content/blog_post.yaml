      body: "<p>If you like amazing beaches, favorable taxes, and affordable real estate, the Sunshine State may be the place for you. But where in Florida should you call home? We researched cities from the Panhandle to the Keys to find the best places to live in Florida based on features that are on top of most homebuyers’ minds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwepickedthebestplacestoliveinflorida\">How We Picked the Best Places to Live in Florida</h2>\n<p>We’re big fans of just about every place you can live in Florida, so picking the best wasn’t easy. Ultimately, we came up with these five categories to help us choose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost of living:</strong> A cost of living index compares one area to another based on what people typically spend on basic necessities. Our highest score went to places with an overall cost of living index between 70 and 74. Anything with an index of 115 or higher earned just one point.</li>\n<li><strong>Housing costs:</strong> We gave places more points when the median housing price is below $200,000. Lower scores went to more expensive areas, with a middle range of $300,001 - $330,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Our lifestyle score is based on the cultural, recreational, and entertainment opportunities available in each city.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime:</strong> We used data from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com\" text=\"NeighborhoodScout\" >}} to assess Florida cities’ crime rates. Rates are based on incidents per 1,000 residents of the city.</li>\n<li><strong>Schools:</strong> For schools, we focused on average test scores based on data from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.publicschoolreview.com\" text=\"Public School Review\" >}}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cities could earn up to 10 points in each category for a possible 50 points in total. The chart below lists the total for our top 10 best places to live and the score the cities earned in each category.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"top10bestplacestoliveinflorida\">Top 10 Best Places to Live in Florida</h3>\n<p>| Header | Total | Cost of Living | Housing | Lifestyle | Crime | Schools |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jacksonville | 34 | 6 | 9 | 9 | 5 | 5 |\n| Ocala | 32 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 3 |\n| Tampa | 31 | 4 | 4 | 10 | 7 | 6 |\n| Daytona Beach | 30 | 7 | 9 | 10 | 2 | 2 |\n| Cape Coral | 30 | 4 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 7 |\n| Naples | 29 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 10 | 8 |\n| Pensacola | 29 | 7 | 8 | 7 | 5 | 2 |\n| Fort Myers | 29 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 6 | 5 |\n| Port St. Lucie | 29 | 4 | 4 | 7 | 10 | 4 |\n| Sarasota | 23 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 5 | 7 |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"1jacksonville\">1. Jacksonville</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>Like many Florida cities, Jacksonville boasts beautiful beaches where residents can swim, surf and sail. But the opportunities to get outside don’t stop there. The St. Johns River also flows through the city, and the area has the largest urban park system in the country. Add to this a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/economic-forecast-jacksonvilles-recovery-is-on-the-fast-track\" text=\"growing job market\" >}}, a median home price of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Jacksonville_FL/overview\" text=\"$274,700\" >}}, and a cost of living index of 93.5, and it’s easy to see why Jacksonville is one of the best places to live in Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2ocala\">2. Ocala</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>Located in central Florida, Ocala stands out as the only city on our list that isn’t located on the ocean. The result is a different lifestyle than many of its beach town counterparts. Ocala is best known for its equestrian roots, with rolling hills and green pastures dominating the scenery.</p>\n<p>Housing costs in Ocala are reasonable. The median home sale is {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Ocala_FL/overview\" text=\"$245,000\" >}}, and the cost of living index is 83.8. Ocala’s historic district boasts several unique <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">types of homes</a>, including Queen Anne, Tudor, and Mediterranean styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3tampa\">3. Tampa</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>Tampa is a sports fan’s dream location. Not only do professional football, baseball, and hockey teams call the city home, but several major league baseball teams hold their spring training camps in the area. While the city is a great place for anyone who loves being on the water, it also offers a lively mix of museums, hot night spots, and family-friendly attractions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important qualities are its cost of living index,100.1, and median home cost, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Tampa_FL/overview\" text=\"$350,000\" >}}. You should note, however, that the median cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa home insurance</a> is $2,107, well above the average premium in the US.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4daytonabeach\">4. Daytona Beach</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>There’s more to Daytona Beach than just the Daytona International Speedway, though that is a major attraction for car enthusiasts. Like many people living in Florida, Daytona Beach residents like being outdoors, whether that means fishing, golfing, or just enjoying the beach. However, Daytona Beach balances recreational activities with a vibrant cultural scene that offers several museums and theaters.</p>\n<p>Daytona Beach is also a very affordable city. The median home price is {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Daytona-Beach_FL/overview\" text=\"$210,500\" >}}, and the cost of living index is 85.7.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5capecoral\">5. Cape Coral</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>Dreaming about owning a home on the waterfront? Then Cape Coral may be the place for you. Not only is the city located on a peninsula, but Cape Coral has more than 400 miles of canals for your enjoyment ﹘ many of which take you to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Residents pay for the sights both in terms of median home prices, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Cape-Coral_FL/overview\" text=\"$380,000\" >}}, and cost of living index, 103.9. Moreover, Cape Coral is growing, so you want to get established here before home prices begin to rise even more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6naples\">6. Naples</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>Fashionistas may want to take a closer look at Naples as many high-end retailers have stores in the area. But if browsing boutiques is not your thing, you might still consider Naples for its fine restaurants, amazing beachfront, or world-class golf.</p>\n<p>Living in Naples doesn’t come cheap. As of January 2022, the typical home value in the city is $560,00, and the cost of living is 111.9. That said, Naples is considered safer than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/naples/crime\" text=\"39 percent\" >}} of all US cities, with a crime rate of 15.54 per 1,000 residents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7pensacola\">7. Pensacola</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 30/50</strong></p>\n<p>Located in the Florida Panhandle. Pensacola is known for its emerald green water and white sand beaches. The local architecture and cultural activities highlight the city's Spanish and Native American influences, and as do many of the city’s festivals. Plus, Pensacola is home to the National Naval Aviation Museum and the renowned Blue Angels. All of this also comes with a relatively low cost of living index of 87.3 and median home costs of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Pensacola_FL/overview\" text=\"$249,800\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8fortmyers\">8. Fort Myers</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>Fort Myers is one of the top retirement communities in America, and much of the city's lifestyle reflects an older demographic. However, there are plenty of recreational opportunities for residents of all ages, including fishing, kayaking, hiking, and biking. Moreover, Fort Myers is a fairly affordable city, with a cost of living index of 96.2 and typical home costs of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Fort-Myers_FL/overview\" text=\"$313,800\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9portstlucie\">9. Port St. Lucie</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 29/50</strong></p>\n<p>If chill is your thing but you still want to be close to the bustle of a big city, then you may find that Port St. Lucie is the best place to live. It’s halfway between Miami or Orlando where you can enjoy bars and restaurants by night and amusement parks by day. And you’ll still find people around Port St. Lucie paddleboarding along scenic waterways or playing a few rounds of golf.</p>\n<p>Port St. Lucie’s premium location does mean you’ll pay a bit more to live there. Typical home values are around {{< external-link url=\"https://www.zillow.com/port-saint-lucie-fl/home-values\" text=\"$351,800\" >}} and the cost of living index is 100.7.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10sarasota\">10. Sarasota</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 23/50</strong></p>\n<p>The Sarasota-Bradenton metro area may have a population of 750,000, but Sarasota itself counts just over 54,000 residents. As a result, Sarasota feels like a small town with some big-city amenities, including several performing arts venues. The city is also home to several well-known art festivals, ranging from street painting to improv.</p>\n<p>The median price for Sarasota homes is high, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Sarasota_FL/overview\" text=\"$464,500\" >}}, and the cost of living index, 102.7, is slightly higher than several of the other Florida cities on our list. But the combination of outdoor activities, art, and culture make Sarasota a town worth considering for your forever home.</p>\n<p>If Florida isn’t your cup of tea, then check out our article on the <a href=\"/blog/best-places-to-live/\">best places to live in the US</a>!</p>"

We gave cities with lower median housing costs higher scores.</li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle.</strong> Cities were given a score based on recreation options available in the area, including outdoor activities, arts, and sports.</li>\n<li><strong>Crime rate.</strong> We used crime rates from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com\" text=\"NeighborhoodScout\" >}} to evaluate safety in each city. Higher crime rates resulted in lower scores for this criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Schools</strong>. We focused on testing data from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.publicschoolreview.com\" text=\"Public School Review\" >}} to evaluate each city’s schools. The higher the average test score, the better we ranked the city’s schools.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We added the scores for a total out of 50 to determine our favorite cities in the US. The chart below lists our top 10, along with their total scores and their scores for each criterion.

Austin, Texas</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 40/50</strong></p>\n<p>With a population of nearly 1 million residents, Austin is the largest city on our list of best places. It ranks high for its cost of living index (66.51), which earned the city a full 10 points in our scoring system, and for its schools. However, housing in Austin is expensive. The city’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/austin-real-estate-market\" text=\"median listing price is $579,000\" >}}, well above the nation’s median of $374,900.</p>\n<p>That said, Austins’s hot summers and mild winters gives residents plenty of opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and the many cultural activities Austin has to offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2boiseidaho\">2. Boise, Idaho</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 40/50</strong></p>\n<p>Idaho has been booming for a while now, and Boise is a prime example of how popular the Gem State has become. The city’s population grew by {{< external-link url=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ingowinzer/2021/12/02/boise-is-boomingreal-estate-investors-should-take-note/?sh=692b0e533b66\" text=\"8 percent\" >}} over the last three years, brought on in part by people looking to enjoy the area’s affordability and access to fantastic hiking and biking trails. Moreover, Boise boasts a vibrant cultural scene that includes several museums and a thriving performing arts community.</p>\n<p>However, boomtowns come with boomtown prices, particularly when you look at housing costs. The median listing price reached {{< external-link url=\"https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/boise-real-estate\" text=\"$510,000 in December 2021\" >}}, but you may be able to balance that out through an overall low cost of living index (68.30).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3tampaflorida\">3. Tampa, Florida</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 38/50</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, Tampa benefits from Florida’s beautiful weather and world-class beaches. Locals take advantage of both, whether that means boating, fishing, or golf. But Tampa is also home to a variety of performing arts venues, popular nightlife districts, and sports teams.</p>\n<p>At 75.46, the cost of living index is higher than the first two cities on our list, but the median housing cost is just $351,400. That combined with no state income tax, could make Tampa a budget friendly option. The only dealbreaker might be the cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa home insurance</a>, but we may be able to help you with that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4tempearizona\">4. Tempe, Arizona</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 35/50</strong></p>\n<p>Tempe is where a college town meets industry. Many major corporations call the city home and recruit from Arizona State University. The result is that Tempe’s anticipated job growth for the next 10 years {{< external-link url=\"https://www.bestplaces.net/economy/city/arizona/tempe\" text=\"outstrips the rest of the US\" >}}. The university also attracts artists and performers of all stripes, plus the area is known for exceptional hiking and golf.</p>\n<p>The flip side of that positive job growth and abundance of activities may be the cost of living. Tempe’s cost of living index is 112.6 and {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Tempe_AZ/overview\" text=\"median home price is $475,000\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5bouldercolorado\">5. Boulder, Colorado</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>Boulder, another college town, is an outdoor lovers’ haven. Residents are just minutes away from hiking, rock climbing, and world-class skiing, plus the area’s temperate climate and 300 days of sunshine means they can enjoy the outdoors more often than not. Another benefit? The area’s growth hasn’t diminished its small-town feel where people love being part of the community.</p>\n<p>Expenses, however, are high in Boulder. As of December 2021, the median house listing price was $899,000 with a cost of living index of 167.4. But that may be the tradeoff for a top-notch education Boulder schools’ test scores are in the top 90 percent in the nation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6alexandriavirginia\">6. Alexandria, Virginia</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 34/50</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest draw for Alexandria has to be its proximity to historical landmarks and cultural events. But locals also know the city offers approximately 950 acres of parks, a delightful array of restaurants, and a diverse population. Alexandria also claims the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/va/alexandria/crime\" text=\"lowest crime rate\" >}} out of all the cities on our list of best places to live.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, living in Alexandria isn’t cheap. In May 2021, the average home price {{< external-link url=\"https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/home-and-garden/average-home-price-above-700k-alexandria-va-may-2021\" text=\"skyrocketed to $710,000\" >}}. That settled down to a median of $550,000 in December, but the cost of living index sits at 112.6.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7batonrougelouisiana\">7. Baton Rouge, Louisiana</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>College sports may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Baton Rouge, but the city is also proud of its extensive park system, expanding visual arts scene, and variety of architectural points of interest. Plus, Baton Rouge is probably one of the most cost-effective cities in the country. The median home price in the city is {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Baton-Rouge_LA/overview\" text=\"$244,900\" >}} – $130,000 below the national median – and the cost of living index is 91.7.</p>\n<p>Baton Rouge also offers much of the good food and music found in nearby New Orleans. But this location means the city also sees more than its share of hurricanes, and that typically translates into higher-than-average <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8saltlakecityutah\">8. Salt Lake City, Utah</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 32/50</strong></p>\n<p>Salt Lake City mixes amazing scenery with affordable homes and a growing tech industry. The city’s median home price is $499,900. That’s higher than the national median, but when you add in the reasonable cost of living (64.96), Salt Lake City becomes a viable option for many homeowners, including single professionals and young families.</p>\n<p>Although skiing and snowboarding will always have their place, Salt Lake’s cultural scene is much more than winter sports. Residents can also enjoy professional and amateur theater, several museums, and a host of festivals celebrating the area’s diversity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9desmoinesiowa\">9. Des Moines, Iowa</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>With over 215,000 people, Des Moines is a good-sized city with a diverse population that somehow manages to maintain a sense of community. At least some of that’s due to the city’s cultural events and festivals. Even better? Des Moines may be the most affordable city on our list of best places to live. The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.dsmpartnership.com/living-here/relocate-here/cost-of-living-calculator\" text=\"median home price of $173,000\" >}} is among the most reasonable in the country, and the cost of living index sits at 96.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10pasadenacalifornia\">10. Pasadena, California</h2>\n<p><strong>Score: 31/50</strong></p>\n<p>Pasadena is more than just a college football mecca. Art festivals frequent its parks, and locals are close to great hiking and skiing.

      body: "<p>Whether you’re trying to attract buyers or make your home more inviting to guests, you want your home to be beautiful inside and out. These simple curb appeal ideas can spruce up your home’s exterior in a way that prospective buyers and guests will love.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1chooseuniquelandscaping\">1. Choose Unique Landscaping</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-landscaping.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of colorful flower garden in front of a white house\" title=\"Landscaping improves your curb appeal by framing your house.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Landscaping acts as a frame for your home, so keep it interesting.</small></i></p>\n<p>When it comes to curb appeal, landscaping is of the utmost importance. Your yard frames your entire house, so you want to make sure your lawn, trees, and other greenery are healthy and neat.</p>\n<p>“You want your property to appear well put together, and having interesting trees and plants can make it seem like a unique find altogether,” says Jeremy Yamaguchi of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.lawnlove.com\" text=\"Lawn Love\" >}}. “Trees or plants with unique colors, shapes, or that are simply different from what the surrounding yards have will all work.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"2addpottedplantstoyourentrance\">2. Add Potted Plants to Your Entrance</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-potted-plants.jpg\" alt=\"A cement planter holding purple, yellow, and red flowers on the front porch of a white home\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Potted plants are an inexpensive option for creating curb appeal.</small></i></p>\n<p>Similar to landscaping, potted plants near your door can brighten up what might otherwise be a dull space. Andra DelMonico of {{< external-link url=\"https://trendey.com\" text=\"Trendey\" >}} says this easy curb appeal idea is easy and “breathes life and color into your entry” while also making our home look well cared for.</p>\n<p>“Choose plants that are full and thriving for the biggest immediate impact,” DelMonico recommends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keepyourhedgesneatlytrimmed\">3. Keep Your Hedges Neatly Trimmed</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-hedges.jpg\" alt=\"A row of neatly trimmed bushes along the side of a home\" title=\"Give your hedges sharp edges to keep them looking neat.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Regular maintenane keeps your hedges looking sharp.</small></i></p>\n<p>Taking care of your hedges and bushes is essential to making your home attractive, according to Omer Reiner, a licensed realtor with {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floridacashhomebuyers.com/jacksonville\" text=\"Florida Cash Home Buyers\" >}}. He explains that sharp edges make bushes appear neatly trimmed longer.</p>\n<p>“Trim-looking bushes increase curb appeal and home value quite significantly,” says Reiner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4paintthefrontdoor\">4. Paint the Front Door</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-door.jpg\" alt=\"A white home with a bright teal door\" title=\"Bold colors on your front door create a focal point.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>A brightly colored front door gives your home a focal point.</small></i></p>\n<p>Andre Kazimierski of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.improovy.com/phoenix-painters\" text=\"Improovy Painters\" >}} says using an accent color is a good way to freshen up your entrance while also boosting your curb appeal. He suggests painting your front door a bold color to “give your home a focal point that is so important for first impressions.”</p>\n<p>Remember, however, that you want to coordinate your accent color with the other colors already on your house. Make your siding and trim similar in color so your front door really pops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5addwindowboxes\">5. Add Window Boxes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-window-box.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Window boxes with beautiful flowers can add to the perceived value of your home.</small></i></p>\n<p>Miami realtor Trey Van Tuyl of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.discoverhomesmiami.com\" text=\"DiscoverHomesMiami.com\" >}} thinks window boxes are a great idea for increasing curb appeal. “This might seem a bit old-fashioned,“ he says, “but buyers love to see attractive window boxes full of colorful flowers.They go a long way to adding perceived value to your home.”</p>\n<p>Window boxes are {{< external-link url=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/windows/21016687/how-to-hang-a-window-box\" text=\"easy to install\" >}} and are a relatively inexpensive way to add color to your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6displaynewhousenumbers\">6. Display New House Numbers</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-numbers.jpg\" alt=\"The number 30 on the white column of a house\" title=\"Adding decorative house numbers is easy and inexpensive.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Easy-to-read house numbers make your home more inviting.</small></i></p>\n<p>Have you ever struggled to find an address only to realize that the homeowners don’t have their address on display? Or they used the stick-on variety that often fails to stick? Either way, the result is less than inviting, so Leonard Ang of {{< external-link url=\"https://ipropertymanagement.com\" text=\"iPropertyManagement\" >}} recommends installing new house numbers that are visible from the street on the mailbox and near the garage.</p>\n<p>\"These two things are relatively cheap projects, costing less than $200. However, the curb appeal is priceless,” says Ang.</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to match the numbers to the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">style of your house</a> and to the finish of your outside light fixtures.This helps create cohesion in your home’s appearance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8addhardscaping\">8. Add Hardscaping</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-hardscape.jpg\" alt=\"A two-tiered retaining wall made of stone next to an asphalt driveway\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Hardscaping can be functional and attractive.</small></i></p>\n<p>You can use hardscaping﹘essentially, any part of your landscaping that isn’t living﹘to increase your overall overall curb appeal, according to Thomas Jepsen of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.passionplans.com\" text=\"Passion Plans\" >}}. He suggests “breaking the home's traditional curves” using “natural elements, such as rock.” Combining that with plants like hanging wisteria creates “a fairytale curb appeal” and “a welcoming outdoor space.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"7illuminateyourhomesexterior\">7. Illuminate Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-lighted-entry.jpg\" alt=\"A brightly lit front porch\" title=\"Lighting your home increases both curb appeal and safety.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Lighting your entry helps with curb appeal and safety.</small></i></p>\n<p>Lighting up your home definitely increases its appeal, but that’s only one benefit, according to Dan Belcher of {{< external-link url=\"https://mortgage-relief.com\" text=\"Mortgage Relief\" >}}. He claims the added light increases safety, especially if you rely on new technologies to turn them on and off. “Smart home features are great for additional security since installation can be upgradeable with an enabled camera or fingerprint scan﹘something many homeowners want today.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9drawattentiontoyourwindows\">9. Draw Attention to Your Windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-shutters.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of white shutters and window box with flowers on a bright blue house\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>You can transform your home's exterior with colorful shutters.</small></i></p>\n<p>Shutters add visual interest that can boost curb appeal, plus painting them is another way to add a pop of color to your exterior. But if shutters don’t appeal to you, then you may want to pay attention to your window treatments.</p>\n<p>Granted, most people think of window treatments as part of their <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design</a>, but Rachel Fernie of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.hunterdouglas.com\" text=\"Hunter Douglas\" >}} says you can “bright blinds or curtains to add character” that can transform how your windows appear from the outside. Alternatively, Fernie suggests displaying a piece of statement art in the window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10updateyourmailbox\">10. Update Your Mailbox</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curb-appeal-ideas-mailbox.jpg\" alt=\"A black mailbox with a gold flag in the front yard of a Florida home\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Increase your curb appeal by swapping out your old mailbox for something more on trend.</small></i></p>\n<p>Nothing sours the appearance of your manicured law like a dilapidated mailbox, so Dino DeNenna from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.hiltonheadrealtysales.com\" text=\"Hilton Head Realty\" >}} recommends changing your old one for something new and trendy.</p>\n<p>“A new mailbox installation can cost you around $50-$200, depending on the type of mailbox you need, says DeNenna, and adds that “a warm-colored and posh-looking mailbox increases the home’s curb appeal.”</p>"

      title: "10 quick ways to winterize your home"
      body: "<p>Many parts of the country have already seen their first snowfall of the year, but that doesn’t mean it’s too late to winterize your home. You can still prep your home for cold weather, both inside and out, to reduce your chances of hefty repair bills or <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">insurance claims</a>.</p>\n<p>Get started with these 10 easy ways to winterize your home to keep you cozy until spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1cleanyourgutters\">1. Clean your gutters</h2>\n<p>Winter snow and rain can overwhelm your gutters, especially if they're full of leaves and debris. Cleaning your gutters helps ensure that water from rain and melting snow or ice flows away from your house. While you’re at it, make sure your downspout also pushes water far from your foundation to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">reduce your risk of water damage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2reverseyourceilingfan\">2. Reverse your ceiling fan</h2>\n<p>You may not think about ceiling fans as part of your <a href=\"/blog/prep-your-home-for-winter/\">winter preparations</a>, but they can help with heating. Just reverse your fan so that it rotates clockwise and pushes warm air down. You can usually do this on a pull chain fan by pushing the reversal switch found on the body of the fan. Some fans have reversal switches on their remotes or wall switches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3installnewweatherstripping\">3. Install new weatherstripping</h2>\n<p>Drafts can do a number on your heating bill. But weatherstripping on doors and windows can only eliminate drafts if it hasn’t worn down or fallen off. Take a look at your weatherstripping and replace it if you see missing chunks or light shining through when the door or window is closed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4installelectricaloutletgaskets\">4. Install electrical outlet gaskets</h2>\n<p>Another way to stop cold air from coming into your home (and your hard-earned dollars from going out) is to buy foam rubber outlet gaskets. Outlets typically sit in junction boxes that have holes for wires, and that allows a surprising amount of cold air to sneak in. Prevent air leaks by removing the cover plate, pressing the gasket in place, and replacing the plate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5winterizehomeplumbing\">5. Winterize home plumbing</h2>\n<p>Pipes can freeze during winter months –&nbsp;yes, even if you live in the South. Just look at Texas in February 2021 – a cold snap caused <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/18/texas-winter-weather-frozen-pipes-burst-food-damage-expected/4489631001/\">frozen pipes to burst</a> throughout the state. Surprisingly, homes in warmer climates may have even more risk because builders are less likely to properly insulate pipes.</p>\n<p>Long story short, every homeowner should take steps to winterize their home plumbing. This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insulating pipes.</strong> Cover pipes in exterior walls or uninsulated attics and basements with foam rubber or fiberglass sleeves. These are available at most hardware stores.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave taps on.</strong> If you face a particularly harsh cold snap, you may be able to prevent frozen pipes by leaving faucets on just enough to let out a trickle of water.</li>\n<li><strong>Disconnect and drain outdoor hoses.</strong> Leaving exterior hoses connected may allow ice to build up, which can lead to interior plumbing problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Cover outdoor faucets.</strong> Winter covers for your exterior faucets are an inexpensive way to winterize your home plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you're at it, be sure to {{< external-link url=\"https://www.adbseptic.com/post/how-to-prepare-your-septic-system-for-winter\" text=\"prepare your septic tank for winter\" >}}, too. </p>\n<h2 id=\"6findyourshutoffvalve\">6. Find your shut-off valve</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the easiest way to winterize your home plumbing is to make sure you and everyone living with you knows how to shut off your water supply. Find both the main shut-off valve as well as the shut-off valves on your other fixtures, such as your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water heater.</li>\n<li>Dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Sinks.</li>\n<li>Toilets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granted, this won’t completely save you from water damage, but it can minimize problems if a pipe bursts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7installasmartthermostat\">7. Install a smart thermostat</h2>\n<p>Installing a smart thermostat that keeps your home at the right temperature no matter what’s going on can <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce your energy consumption and your energy bill</a>. Program it to kick in when you’re about to get up in the morning so the home is warm and set it to turn temperatures down while you’re asleep or at work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getaheatingsystemtuneup\">8. Get a heating system tune-up</h2>\n<p>Every aspect of your heating system needs an annual check up performed by a professional technician. Regular maintenance can reduce heating costs, improve air quality, and prevent breakdowns. Most importantly, a professional HVAC technician can identify issues that may lead to carbon monoxide leaks, a problem that leads to {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/copoisoning/index.html\" text=\"430 deaths and 50,000 emergency room visits\" >}} every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9changethebatteriesinsmokedetectors\">9. Change the batteries in smoke detectors</h2>\n<p>Space heaters, candles, fireplaces, and <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">holiday decorations create serious fire risk</a> during the winter months. You already test (or should test) smoke detectors once every month, so why not take the onset of the winter holidays as a cue to change the batteries?</p>\n<h2 id=\"10trimtreesandbranches\">10. Trim trees and branches</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">Trimming trees</a> reduces the chance of a branch breaking and falling on your home, car, or fence. Before the onset of serious snow, late fall or early winter in many areas of the county, is a good time to trim back branches. That’s when many trees are dormant, and trees have bare branches so pruning is easier.</p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances and your policy, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> typically covers the cost of many of the potential claims in this list. However, the last thing you want is to have a claim during the harsh winter months. Do what you can to prevent a claim from happening in the first place.</p>"

      title: "10 tornado safety tips"
      body: "<p>The tornadoes that recently devastated parts of the South and Midwest are a stark reminder of just how deadly and destructive these storms can be. This particular system brought {{< external-link url=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/deadly-tornado-outbreak-numbers/story?id=81742001\" text=\"35 confirmed tornadoes across five states\" >}}, destroying over 1,000 homes in Kentucky alone. Worse, the death toll stands at 90 with over 100 people unaccounted for as of this writing.</p>\n<p>One reason tornadoes are so dangerous is that there’s no “tornado season.” They may be more common in the spring, but they can occur at any time of year and in places far removed from <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley</a>. Moreover, they develop quickly and behave erratically, leaving little time for people to react and take shelter.</p>\n<p>Knowing what to do before a tornado hits can save you precious time. Here are 10 tips to show you and your family how to stay safe during a tornado.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1payattentiontowarnings\">1. Pay attention to warnings</h2>\n<p>The most important tornado safety tip is to stay alert when bad weather moves through your area. That includes tuning in to weather reports, staying alert when there is a tornado watch, and immediately taking shelter when a tornado warning is in effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2movetothebasementquickly\">2. Move to the basement quickly</h2>\n<p>While no space is 100 percent safe during a tornado, rooms below ground like a basement offer you the most protection. If you don’t have a basement, your best bet is a room on the lowest floor of your home, preferably an interior one that doesn’t have windows like a bathroom, closet, or center hallway. You should also avoid sheltering where there are heavy objects like appliances on the floor above you.</p>\n<p>Getting to the lowest floor is also ideal if you’re in a high rise. However, the average lead time for a tornado warning is only about <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2021/06/16/tornado-warning-system-has-come-long-way-but-could-better/5152104001/\">nine minutes</a>, so that may not be possible. Your next option is to find the safest room in your apartment. Again, this could be a bathroom, center hallway, or interior closet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3crouchlowtotheground\">3. Crouch low to the ground</h2>\n<p>When you find a suitable spot to shelter, lay face down on the ground and cover your head with your hands to protect yourself from flying debris. You might also want to get under heavy blankets and pillows. Even winter coats can act as a cushion if anything falls on you, plus they may keep you warm once the storm is over. Avoid laying next to heavy, unsecured objects that might fall on you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getundersomethingsturdy\">4. Get under something sturdy</h2>\n<p>You need to be prepared for the building to collapse. While you don’t want to be next to heavy objects that might fall on you, being under something sturdy like a heavy table, workbench, or desk. This can create a pocket of safety for you if the entire room collapses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5monitorstormalerts\">5. Monitor storm alerts</h2>\n<p>There are several ways to get updates on whether tornadoes continue to pose a danger in your area. Your local news will post updates, as will the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via its network of radio stations. If you haven’t already, you can also sign up for community alerts on your mobile phone. Try to have one of these handy so you know when you can safely go back outside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6donotstayinamobilehome\">6. Do not stay in a mobile home</h2>\n<p>Mobile homes are particularly susceptible to damage in a tornado. Many mobile home communities have storm shelters for their residents. If yours doesn’t, or if you live on private land, then you may need to find other shelter, preferably a building with a foundation. You’ll need to act fast if a tornado is approaching, so identify nearby options now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7goinside\">7. Go inside</h2>\n<p>Being outside makes you very susceptible to being swept up by tornado winds, so you want to find a building to shelter in. If possible, choose a building that has a basement where you will be safer from collapse and debris.</p>\n<p>If there isn’t suitable shelter, or there isn’t enough time to get to it, then go to the lowest ground you can find and lay flat with your hands over your head. Do your best to move away from cars or trees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8donttrytooutdrivethetornado\">8. Don’t try to outdrive the tornado</h2>\n<p>In general, you don’t want to try to outrun a tornado, but some situations may require you to get in your car to drive to a safer location. When that happens, take the most direct route to shelter.</p>\n<p>If you’re caught in your car during a tornado, stay in it with your head below the windows and your seatbelt on. Only leave your car if you can safely get to ground that is clearly lower than your car. Once there, lay face down and cover your head.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9avoidoverpassesifpossible\">9. Avoid overpasses if possible</h2>\n<p>An overpass might look like a safe structure for sheltering, but it can actually put you in greater danger during a tornado. The shape creates a tunneling effect that can increase wind speeds, so do not shelter below overpasses or bridges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10prepareanemergencydisasterkit\">10. Prepare an emergency disaster kit</h2>\n<p>Being prepared for a tornado includes thinking about what you might need after one hits. You have to assume that it may be days before assistance arrives, so you want to <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/owlie/emergencysupplieskit\">build a disaster kit</a> that has important supplies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bottled water.</li>\n<li>Nonperishable food.</li>\n<li>A NOAA radio.</li>\n<li>Bandages, gauze, and other first aid supplies.</li>\n<li>Cell phone charger.</li>\n<li>Prescription medications.</li>\n<li>Cash.</li>\n<li>Copies of your identification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put these and other items you cannot do without in a bag and stash it in the area you’ve designated for shelter.</p>\n<p>While some weather events provide enough warning to prepare for the potential impact, tornadoes can hit within minutes. Having a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> can make the difference for your and your family.</p>"

      title: "11 Things to Consider When You Move"
      body: "<p>Congrats! You’re moving into a new home. This time is exciting…and daunting. After all, there’s a lot to do. You need to complete repairs and projects on the new home, notify utility and billing companies about your new address, hire movers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>And that’s all before move-in day!</p>\n<p>We at Kin understand this, and have put together this new home checklist to keep at your side. These are the top items every new homeowner needs to remember before, day-of, and after the big move.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1tackleyourpunchlist\">1) Tackle Your Punch List</h3>\n<p>If you’re purchasing a newly constructed home, you should ask the home’s builder/contractor for a <a href=\"https://blog.plangrid.com/2017/11/building-101-what-is-a-construction-punch-list/\">punch list</a> - the list of problems that need to be fixed by the builder. Though reputable builders will have already done this, you should never assume.</p>\n<p>Once the contractor has put together the punch list, they’ll flag the issues with red tape and have their workers address each one. Upon completion, the contractor should do another walkthrough to make sure all problems were fixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<h3 id=\"2purchasehomeinsurance\">2) Purchase Home Insurance</h3>\n<p>Though you probably had to apply for home insurance when applying for a mortgage, this step is important for all homeowners no matter their financial situation. Home insurance covers costs for a variety of events related to (or that occur on) your property.</p>\n<p>Most home insurance policies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling Insurance</a>: Coverage for damage to your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other Structures Insurance</a>: Coverage for additional structures on your home, such as a shed or detached garage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal Property Insurance</a>: Coverage for personal belongings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use Insurance</a>: Coverage for expenses incurred while you were displaced from your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability Insurance</a>: Coverage for claims made against you due to events that happened on your property (e.g. injury).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments Insurance</a>: Coverage for necessary medical expenses (i.e. smaller claims) due to an accident that happened on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners should shop around and compare providers before settling on a home insurance policy. Different providers may qualify you for different discounts (e.g. new home, bundling with other products) which may lower your premiums and deductible.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing (e.g. when getting a mortgage)</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"3getahomeinspection\">3) Get a Home Inspection</h3>\n<p>Ideally, you should have your <a href=\"http://www.hgtv.com/design/real-estate/6-things-to-know-before-buying-a-new-home\">home inspected by an independent professional</a> before purchasing. The inspector can identify minor and major issues that you could leverage to save thousands on the home’s final price. Compared to the average inspection cost of $200-300, the potential savings are a bargain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Before closing</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> Before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"4updatemailingandbillinginformation\">4) Update Mailing and Billing Information</h3>\n<p>Alright, now things are starting to sink in. Once you have a move-in date confirmed, you need to notify all major accounts of your change in address. These should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banks and credit card companies</li>\n<li>Employer</li>\n<li>Insurance companies</li>\n<li>Other accounts (e.g. student loan companies)</li>\n<li>Subscriptions (e.g. magazines, memberships)</li>\n<li>Utility companies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also <a href=\"http://www.houseandhammer.com/new-home-checklist-things-new-homeowners-should-do-right-away/\">set up mail forwarding at your post office</a> to make sure you receive all mail over the first few months after the move. Monitoring the mail that gets forwarded will help you take stock of anything that slipped through the cracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"5setupservicesatyournewhome\">5) Set Up Services At Your New Home</h3>\n<p>For your new home, you need to contact utility and service providers to set up start dates. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electric</li>\n<li>Gas</li>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Internet</li>\n<li>Cable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These dates don’t need to align with your move-in date, but instead should be coordinated with when you plan to work on the home. For example, if you plan to paint two weeks before the move-in date, you should have your electric turned on for that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"6hireamover\">6) Hire A Mover</h3>\n<p>Once you have a move-in date, you need to hire a moving company. However, not all moving companies are reputable or may be suited to your needs. To avoid things going wrong on the big move-in day, keep in mind the following tips for hiring a mover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check online sites like Angie’s List to view customer reviews and get a sense of how the mover deals with customers.</li>\n<li>Reputable movers will want to take inventory of all your belongings to estimate moving costs and needed labor/equipment.</li>\n<li>Reputable movers won’t ask for a cash or a large deposit. Instead, they’ll ask for payment upon completion of the move.</li>\n<li>Movers will ask you to sign a contract. Review the contract to ensure it includes all items you’re asking them to handle for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ideal Time To Do:</strong> Once you have a move-in date</p>\n<p><strong>Latest Time To Do:</strong> 1-2 weeks before move-in day</p>\n<h3 id=\"7completehomerepairs\">7) Complete Home Repairs</h3>\n<p>You know what’s better than completing home improvements in your home? Doing them free of furniture and personal clutter. Whether you decide to hire help or take on the improvements yourself, it’s a good idea to handle as many projects as possible before moving in.</p>\n<p>Not only will this remove the stress of protecting your personal belongings, but will also make easier any “behind-the-walls” projects, such as updating wiring or plumbing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafterthemove\">What to Do after the Move</h2>\n<h3 id=\"8changethelocks\">8) Change the Locks</h3>\n<p>Protecting the new home is a top priority for any new homeowner. Changing the locks is the first steps.</p>\n<p>No matter how much you trust the realtor, previous homeowners, or contractors, it’s hard to tell how many copies of your home’s keys are around. After changing the locks, have a few copies made for yourself, the other residents, and a trusted person (e.g. neighbor or nearby friend) for emergencies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9developemergencyplans\">9) Develop Emergency Plans</h3>\n<p>Fires, pipe bursts, blown fuses. Even in a new home, accidents can happen, which is why you should have an emergency plan in place. Specifically, you should do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an emergency contact list, complete with the numbers for local services (e.g. electrician, plumber) and addresses of area hospitals.</li>\n<li>Know the location of your shut-off valves. There are two types of valves: those that service specific appliances (e.g. stove, toilet) and “master” valves that direct water or gas into your home.</li>\n<li>Have a fire plan in place, which should include available exits from every room and a meeting location away from the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"10getasafe\">10) Get a Safe</h3>\n<p>If moving into a new home can show us anything, it’s that we have a lot of important documents that need to be stored properly. Home insurance policies, closing documents, and mortgage records are just a few of the items homeowners may need to have in the event of an emergency. Off-site safes are also good for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have one already, consider getting a safe or filing cabinet to store these items. Other important things to consider adding to the safe could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appraisals and home inventories</li>\n<li>Contractor bills and estimates</li>\n<li>Instruction manual for electronics or furniture</li>\n<li>Tax returns</li>\n<li>Wills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"11createamaintenancechecklist\">11) Create a Maintenance Checklist</h3>\n<p>New homeowners will want to keep their home in as best shape as possible. Creating a maintenance checklist will help do just that.</p>\n<p>Home maintenance checklists are great because they can remind you of infrequent, yet routine, items that are important for your home (think checking the smoke detector or replacing furnace pads). Some great checklist templates are available at <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/home-maintenance-checklist-1388708\">The Balance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mrhandyman.com/blog/2013/march/home-maintenance-checklist-printable-maintenance/\">Mr. Handyman</a>.</p>\n<p>Moving into a new house can be one of the most stressful, yet satisfying, times in your life. After all, it’s a place that’s all your own, a place to call home for yourself and your family. Having a checklist of everything you need will help reduce the anxiety that you’ll feel during the big move and keep you focused on the excitement of waking up in your new home.</p>"

      title: "15 Hurricane Facts | Hurricane Information"
      body: "<p>As an insurance company that serves catastrophe-prone states like Florida and Louisiana, we've seen the power of hurricanes firsthand and have helped our homeowners navigate their aftermath. (Just look at <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">our response to Hurricane Irma</a> in 2017 for a snapshot!)</p>\n<p>So we wanted to share some of our historical hurricane knowledge with you. If these hurricane facts aren't enough to inspire you to <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">prepare for the next big storm</a>, we're not sure what will!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1the2020atlantichurricaneseasonsaw30namedstorms\">1. The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Saw 30 Named Storms</h2>\n<p>The 2005 season had more hurricanes (15), but <a href=\"/blog/atlantic-hurricane-season-2021/\">2020 was the most active year on record</a>, with 30 named storms, 14 of which were hurricanes. And of those 14, seven of them were major hurricanes.</p>\n<p>It's further proof that <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-and-home-insurance/\">climate change is making active hurricane seasons the new normal</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2hurricanescanunleashmorethan24trilliongallonsofrainperday\">2. Hurricanes Can Unleash More Than 2.4 Trillion Gallons of Rain Per Day</h2>\n<p>While hurricane winds that can top 160 mph get most of the headlines, the deluge they bring can be just as damaging. Just take 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as an example. When all was said and done, Harvey dumped {{< external-link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/08/30/harvey-has-unloaded-24-5-trillion-gallons-of-water-on-texas-and-louisiana/\" text=\"33 trillion gallons of water\" >}} on the US – enough to fill a 3.1 square mile cube.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3floridagetsmorehurricanesthananyotherstate\">3. Florida Gets More Hurricanes Than Any Other State</h2>\n<p>Between 1885 and 2020, Floridians have suffered {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/#landfalls-by-state\" text=\"120 direct hits\" >}}, which is about 40 percent of the hurricanes to make landfall in the United States during the same period. The Sunshine State has also seen half of the country’s Category 5 storms (2) and 42 percent of the Category 4 storms (11).</p>\n<h2 id=\"4thelongesthurricanelasted31days\">4. The Longest Hurricane Lasted 31 Days</h2>\n<p>Not only did Hurricane John, a Category 5 storm, last from July 25 to September 13, 1994, but it also traveled 7,165 miles between the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This makes it both the farthest-traveled hurricane and one of a handful that has also been classified as a typhoon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5hurricaneallenreachedmaximumsustainedwindsof190mph\">5. Hurricane Allen Reached Maximum Sustained Winds of 190 MPH</h2>\n<p>This speed gives Hurricane Allen the record for most intense hurricane in the Atlantic if you measure it by maximum sustained winds. Its formation on July 31, 1980, also made it the earliest Category 5 hurricane until 2005, when Hurricane Emily roared to life on July 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6hurricanecomesfromthetainowordhuracan\">6. “Hurricane” Comes from the Taino Word “Huraca’n”</h2>\n<p>The Taino, the indigenous people of the Caribbean, believed the {{< external-link url=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/hurricane-from-the-goddess-guabancex-to-fierce-irene\" text=\"god Juracan caused huraca’n\" >}} through the handiwork of an angry goddess named Guabancex and her companions Guatabá and Coatrisquie. Guabancex brought the wind, Guatabá was responsible for the lightning and thunder, and Coatrisquie caused the floods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7hurricaneswereoriginallyonlynamedafterwomen\">7. Hurricanes Were Originally Only Named After Women</h2>\n<p>In the US, the National Hurricane Center first <a href=\"/blog/how-are-hurricanes-named/\">started naming hurricanes in 1953</a>, but only used female names. Prior to this, hurricanes were designated by Catholic saint days, the places where they made landfall, and sometimes even the property they destroyed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8bobwasthefirstmalenameforahurricane\">8. Bob Was the First Male Name for a Hurricane</h2>\n<p>The practice of only using female names was dropped in 1978, thanks in part to civil rights activist and Florida feminist {{< external-link url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxcy<em>Bolton#Hurricane</em>renaming\" text=\"Roxcy Bolton\" >}}. She persuaded the national weather forecasters to include male names for tropical storms, arguing that associating just women with disasters was regressive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9thenamesofthemostdevastatinghurricanesareretired\">9. The Names of the Most Devastating Hurricanes Are Retired</h2>\n<p>The World Meteorological Organization, which now maintains and rotates through six lists of hurricane names for the Atlantic, has {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\" text=\"retired 93 names\" >}} for the destruction they caused. The 2005 season saw the most names retired – five total, including Katrina and Rita. Laura, Eta, and Iota were all retired after 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10openingwindowsinahurricanedoesnotprotectyourhome\">10. Opening Windows in a Hurricane Does Not Protect Your Home</h2>\n<p>Many people think they need to keep their windows open during hurricanes, believing it equalizes pressure in the house, but that's a myth, and a bad one. Open windows may actually allow debris and water that can cause serious damage.</p>\n<p>Instead, make sure your windows are boarded up with plywood or <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane-protection shutters</a> and close your interior doors. Leaving those open compartmentalizes pressure so wind that does get in doesn’t cause your roof to blow off, according to a {{< external-link url=\"https://ibhs.org/ibhs-news-releases/shutting-the-bedroom-door-could-save-your-roof-during-a-hurricane/\" text=\"press release from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11ahurricaneseyewallpresentsthegreatestdanger\">11. A Hurricane’s Eyewall Presents the Greatest Danger</h2>\n<p>The eyewall is the spiraling bands of wind and rain that radiate from the center of a hurricane that gives these storms their distinctive buzzsaw shape. And just like in humans, you can tell a lot about hurricanes by their eyes.</p>\n<p>A ragged, asymmetrical eye means the storm is struggling to strengthen, while a smooth, round eye means that it’s stable and quite strong. On the other hand, a tiny eye –known as a pinhole or pinpoint eye – is a sign of a very intense storm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12somehurricaneshavetwoeyewalls\">12. Some Hurricanes Have Two Eyewalls</h2>\n<p>This process is known as an “eyewall replacement cycle,” which is where a storm develops a new eyewall to replace the old one. An eyewall replacement cycle usually lessens the intensity of the hurricane, but it also spreads out the eye so the hurricane doesn’t have to get as close to land to cause damage, as seen in {{< external-link url=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-10-nasa-hurricane-matthew-eyewalls.html\" text=\"Hurricane Matthew in October 2016\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13hurricanesspinindifferentdirections\">13. Hurricanes Spin in Different Directions</h2>\n<p>How a hurricane spins depends on which hemisphere it’s from. Hurricanes in the Southern Hemisphere spin in a clockwise direction whereas hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere turn counterclockwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14ahurricanesavedjapanfromattack\">14. A Hurricane Saved Japan from Attack</h2>\n<p>When the Mongols attempted an invasion of Japan in 1281, their attack was {{< external-link url=\"http://www.hurricanescience.org/history/storms/pre1900s/1281/\" text=\"halted thanks to a hurricane\" >}} – technically a typhoon because of its location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15hurricanesoftencausetornadoes\">15. Hurricanes Often Cause Tornadoes</h2>\n<p>The tornadoes that come with hurricanes are usually weaker and last a shorter time than the hurricane-free variety, but they can still do some damage. This is especially true when hurricanes cause multiple tornadoes, like Hurricane Ivan did in 2004. It holds the record for most tornadoes spawned with 120.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that can cover repairs to the home and other structures caused by hurricane winds.

      title: "15% of Homeowners Don’t Know What Their Insurance Covers"
      body: "<p>Knowing what your insurance covers is essential for homeowners. After all, if you understand what’s covered and what’s not, you can make sure you have adequate protection. You can identify the add-ons that fit your unique situation. Plus, you’re less likely to file claims that get denied.</p>\n<p>However, a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/is-your-home-insurance-ready-for-extreme-weather/\" text=\"Realtor.com study\" >}} recently revealed that 15 percent of homeowners not only have no idea what their insurance covers, but they also weren’t even sure what to check. Another 29 percent thought they knew what their policies covered, but learned most of that while shopping for coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5detailstocheckinyourhomeinsurancepolicy\">5 Details to Check in Your Home Insurance Policy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> doesn’t have to be hard – we promise! And to prove it, we’ve laid out some of the key details just as one of our representatives would if you called them on the phone. That means we use easy-to-digest language to explain your policy’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage.</li>\n<li>Deductibles.</li>\n<li>Exclusions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customers who know more about home insurance ask better questions and provide more accurate information when they apply for coverage. By the time you get to the end of this post, we want you to have a solid handle on what homeowners insurance covers so you can buy the right policy for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1coverage\">1. Coverage</h3>\n<p>One of the things that confuses people about homeowners insurance is that it’s a single policy, but it’s typically split into six coverage parts or sections. Each coverage kicks in for a different type of financial loss. The six basic coverages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling coverage</a> insures your home’s physical structure and pays to repair or replace it if it’s damaged by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other structures coverage </a>pays for damage to structures that are on your property but aren’t attached to your home, like sheds and gazebos.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">Personal property coverage</a> covers your belongings like appliances, electronics, and clothing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use coverage</a> pays for your additional living expenses if your home is made uninhabitable by a covered peril.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> helps with your legal costs if you're sued for someone’s injuries or property damages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> pays your guests’ immediate medical costs if they're hurt on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2coveragelimits\">2. Coverage Limits</h3>\n<p>The six coverages in homeowners insurance usually have separate limits, or the maximum amount your insurance company pays in a covered claim. Coverage limits can be a percentage of the limit you have on your dwelling coverage. This is typically true for the coverage limits on your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other structures.</li>\n<li>Personal property.</li>\n<li>Loss of use coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your coverages may also have sublimits. A sublimit is the maximum amount your insurance company pays in a particular type of claim. High-value personal property, like fine art or jewelry, often has a sublimit. So you could have $50,000 of personal property coverage, but your insurance company might limit what it pays for jewelry to just $1,500. That may not be enough to pay for damage to something really valuable, like an engagement ring.</p>\n<p>Moreover, sublimits are usually still part of your coverage limit. This your $1,500 jewelry claim also reduces the amount of coverage you have for any other personal property claims you make during your policy term.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3deductibles\">3. Deductibles</h3>\n<p>A deductible is what you pay for a claim before your insurance policy kicks in. For example, let’s say a fire causes $10,000 worth of damage to your dwelling. Your dwelling coverage limit of $250,000 can easily cover that, but your policy also requires you to pay a $500 deductible. You cover that $500 first, and then your insurance carrier pays the remaining $9,500.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance policies can also have more than one deductible, particularly in areas with unique weather risks. Florida is a good example of this because most <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance policies</a> have both a standard deductible and a hurricane deductible. Louisiana homeowners insurance, however, often has both of those and a <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a>.</p>\n<p>Opting for a higher deductible can help you keep premiums down. However, you don’t want to be stuck paying huge out-of-pocket expenses in a claim, so be sure to choose a deductible you can afford.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4exclusions\">4. Exclusions</h3>\n<p>Your homeowners policy also has perils that it doesn’t cover. These are called <a href=\"/glossary/exclusion/\">exclusions</a>, and home insurance usually handles them in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open perils coverage.</strong> Sometimes described as an “all-risk policy,” an open perils policy covers events unless they are specifically mentioned as excluded in the policy language. Common exclusions include flooding and earth movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Named perils coverage.</strong> This type of home insurance only covers perils that are listed in the policy language. There are usually about 16 perils that are named, and therefore covered, by this policy. Anything else is considered an exclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you commit to an insurance policy, you want to know which type of coverage you're getting. Our policies insure your dwelling on an open-perils basis, which many people prefer because it covers so many more risks. Your personal property, however, is usually covered on a named-risk basis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5endorsements\">5. Endorsements</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">Insurance endorsements</a> are key to making sure your homeowners insurance covers what you need it to because they let you add or change coverage. For example, we offer endorsements that cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">Animal liability</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/golf-cart-insurance/\">Golf carts</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">Water backup and sump overflow</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This checklist should be enough to help you find home insurance that fits your situation. But If you still have questions, don’t be afraid to talk to your insurance representative. We want you to understand what your homeowners insurance covers so you get the right protection.</p>"

      title: "15 Spring Cleaning Tips"
      body: "<p>Spring is the season for renewal, and for a lot of people, that means getting their homes in tip-top shape. Whether you’re looking to do a thorough clean or simply organize your stuff, we’ve got spring cleaning tips to make your work easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeaplan\">Make a Plan</h2>\n<p>Spring cleaning seldom gets done in a day, so create a schedule for getting them done. Walk around your home with a notebook or voice recorder and note all of the tasks you want to accomplish. Once you have a list, decide how you want to tackle it. Many people focus on one room at a time, but others prefer to start with jobs that apply to all rooms. Either way, schedule each spring cleaning task and check it off your list as you complete it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"declutteryourhome\">Declutter Your Home</h2>\n<p>Cluttered rooms are like nails on a chalkboard for some people. But even if you’ve learned to tolerate your messy living room, leaving it that way makes it difficult to clean. Set aside time to rid your home of clutter, and make sure you toss out or donate items you have multiples of or that you haven’t used in a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizeyourstuff\">Organize Your Stuff</h2>\n<p>After you declutter, you still need to organize the belongings you keep. Put these items back in their appropriate location. And if things don’t have their own place, start looking at organization solutions﹘but be careful! You don’t want to buy more storage containers without a plan for where they will go and what you’ll put into them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downloadanapp\">Download an App</h2>\n<p>Technology hasn’t fully conquered housekeeping chores, but there are several <a href=\"/blog/10-spring-cleaning-apps/\">apps that make spring cleaning a breeze</a>. Some apps. like Decluttr, Poshmark, and NextDoor, can all save you from the headache of a yard pile once you have a pile of used items to sell. Another app, Centriq, helps you organize routine household chores by scheduling maintenance reminders and storing appliance manuals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkforwaterintrusion\">Check for Water Intrusion</h2>\n<p>Speaking of routine maintenance, spring is a great time to find pesky water intrusion. Look around under your kitchen and bathroom sinks to see if there is any moisture accumulation, and inspect your water heater for leaks and rust. You should also walk the length of any walls with pipes inside to look for signs of moisture and mold. While your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> typically covers sudden, accidental water damage, you’re better off avoiding trouble in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearoutdrawers\">Clear Out Drawers</h2>\n<p>We all have one﹘that dreaded junk drawer filled with anything and everything that doesn’t have a home. Most of the stuff saved in your junk drawer are things you thought you’d need or hated to throw out. Either way, spring is the time to rethink that choice. Take some time to go through your junk drawer (or drawers, as the case may be) and dump all of the useless odds and ends you find.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleanoutyourpantryandrefrigerator\">Clean Out Your Pantry and Refrigerator</h2>\n<p>Does the food in your fridge remind you of an eighth-grade science fair project? Are some of your products in your pantry older than your oldest child? If so, then it’s time to clean both out. First, toss expired products. Then wipe down shelves and the spouts of condiment bottles. As you go through your pantry, set aside unexpired items that you don’t think you’ll use and donate them to a food bank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startatthetop\">Start at the Top</h2>\n<p>When you’re ready to tackle a room, your best bet is to clean from the top to the bottom. Start the highest fixtures, like ceiling fans, crown molding, and shelves, then work your way down to tables and chairs, and end with the floor. That way, all the dust and debris falls to the ground and you only have to vacuum or sweep one time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"washyourwindows\">Wash Your Windows</h2>\n<p>Most of us clean our floors regularly, but spring’s warmer weather means it’s a good time to wash your window. The first step is to mix two gallons of warm water with a teaspoon of dish soap. Next, head outside a long handled microfiber mop or squeegee. Remove your window screens, dip your mop or squeegee in your cleaning mixture, and scrub your windows clean. Finally, spray them with a streak-free glass cleaner and wipe them with a microfiber cloth.</p>\n<p>The steps are pretty much the same for your window interiors, except you’ll first want to remove window coverings, sweep up any dirt or dust, and wipe down your window frames. While you're at it, you might want to toss your drapes in the laundry and dust your blinds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleanwithsteam\">Clean with Steam</h2>\n<p>Steam cleaners use water vapor at high temperatures to clean and disinfect, so they eliminate the need for harsh chemicals and cleaners. You can use steam to clean floors and counters in both the bathroom and kitchen, assuming the surfaces are sealed. Some people even use them on stainless steel appliances and the inside of refrigerators.</p>\n<p>There are some situations, however, where steam cleaners aren’t the right tool for the job. For example, you probably shouldn’t try to steam clean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsealed surfaces, like natural stone or hardwood floors</li>\n<li>Porous surfaces, like bamboo.</li>\n<li>Surfaces finished with water-based paint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you opt for a steam cleaner, make sure you read the manufacturer’s instructions first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"considerahighefficiencyparticulateairvacuum\">Consider a High-Efficiency Particulate Air Vacuum</h2>\n<p>High-efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuums catch tiny, airborne particles that other vacuum cleaners miss, such as pet dander, dust mites and dust. This makes them a huge boon to anyone who suffers from allergies. Be sure to look for HEPA vacuum where the motor and the bag are both completely sealed with rubber gaskets to keep allergens from escaping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replaceyourairfilters\">Replace Your Air Filters</h2>\n<p>Did you know that the typical house needs new air filters once every three months? Add a pet, and you need to change your air filter every two months. Replacing your air filters is a simple home maintenance task that helps keep your home and the air you breathe clean, so add it to your spring cleaning to-do list. And when you look for a replacement filter, be sure to check its {{< external-link url=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-merv-rating\" text=\"minimum efficiency reporting value\" >}} (MERV). The higher the fitler’s MERV rating, the better job it does of trapping particles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scrubyourbathrooms\">Scrub Your Bathrooms</h2>\n<p>Bathroom’s get cleaned regularly, but spring cleaning is a chance to give yours a major scrub down. Key spring cleaning tips for your bathroom include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work from top to bottom, but also from one end of the room to another so you don’t have to do any cleaning twice.</li>\n<li>Use a mixture of warm water and dish soap to wipe down your bathroom walls, backsplash, cabinets, and countertops.</li>\n<li>Wash your shower curtain in your laundry machine on the gentle cycle, then let it air dry. (If it’s plastic, throw in a few towels to protect it.)</li>\n<li>Soak your showerhead in vinegar overnight and scrub it with a toothbrush to get rid of hard water buildup.

      title: "15 Tips for First-Time Landlords"
      body: "<p>Being a landlord isn’t always easy, especially if you’ve never owned an investment property before. These tips for first-time landlords can help you start off on the right foot.</p>\n<p>Remember, the habits you form at the start of a new venture can establish how much time, money, and frustration you’re spared throughout your career as a landlord. Invest early in creating a tried-and-true system for managing your real estate so you can reach your <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">financial goals</a> faster and be a great landlord. Here are some ideas to get you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1createabookkeepingprocess\">1. Create a Bookkeeping Process</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-to-become-a-landlord/\">Being a landlord</a> is a business, and you’ll need to treat it that way. That means tracking your income and your expenses so you don’t have a mess on your hands during tax season. Creating good bookkeeping habits now can be a huge help.</p>\n<p>Your process can be as simple or as complicated as you want – there’s plenty of accounting software to choose from. The important thing is to keep a good record of your deposits, rents, and expenses, like the mortgage, property taxes, maintenance expenses, and any materials used on the property. For example, if you buy cleaning supplies to clean the property, that’s a deductible expense.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2geteverythinginwriting\">2. Get Everything in Writing</h2>\n<p>You know how important a lease is – you can’t do business on a handshake alone! But don’t assume that a boilerplate lease accounts for everything. Make sure your lease clearly outlines your policies about late rent, subletting, pets, noise complaints, etc.</p>\n<p>Every communication you have with tenants about the property should be in writing, too. This includes giving tenants notice when maintenance workers need to stop by or when you’d like to show the property. If there is ever a dispute, you can rely on these records to show you complied with your state’s notice requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3planfortaxes\">3. Plan for Taxes</h2>\n<p>If you only own one property, it can be easy to forget that you’re technically running a business. But you are, and you need to <a href=\"/blog/tax-planning-strategies/\">plan for taxes</a> accordingly. Remember that rent payments are considered income and what you spend to maintain the property is considered an expense.</p>\n<p>It’s smart to talk with a tax advisor before you become a landlord so that you know exactly what to expect on your taxes. For example, you may need to start paying estimated <a href=\"https://www.thebalancesmb.com/self-employment-taxes-what-you-need-to-know-397678\">self-employment taxes</a> on a quarterly basis. This covers your Social Security and Medicare tax obligations, similar to what your employer would withhold from your paychecks. You’re often required to pay these at the federal, state, and city level.</p>\n<p>You also don’t want to miss out on <a href=\"/blog/florida-property-tax-exemptions/\">property tax exemptions</a> that may help ease your tax burden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4knowthehousinglawsinyourarea\">4. Know the Housing Laws in Your Area</h2>\n<p>You will probably need to apply for a Certificate of Occupancy in the county where your property is. This will often give you a crash course on the housing laws and tenant rights in your area.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t need a COO, make sure you understand your responsibilities to your tenants. At the end of the day, ignorance isn’t a defense if there’s a problem with the property and it doesn’t pass a city housing inspection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5establishbusinesshours\">5. Establish Business Hours</h2>\n<p>Emergencies can and will crop up, but in general, create business hours for yourself and stick to them. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself working around the clock, and that can make any business harder to run.</p>\n<p>Make sure tenants know the days and hours you’re available and give them both your email and phone number. Make it clear that you only respond during business hours unless it’s an emergency, like a plumbing issue with the house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6dontrenttofamilyandfriends\">6. Don’t Rent to Family and Friends</h2>\n<p>It might seem like a win-win situation to rent to someone you already know. But the truth is it’s harder to say no to friends and family, and renting out your property is all about maintaining boundaries. For example, if a friend falls on hard times and can’t pay the rent, they may expect a favor that you wouldn’t give other tenants. The easiest way to treat tenants like clients is to rent to folks you don’t have a personal relationship with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7screenyourtenants\">7. Screen Your Tenants</h2>\n<p>A typical tenant screening usually costs about $50. These often include a credit check, work history, criminal history, and eviction history. Though it’s a little investment, it can help make sure you’re renting to tenants who are financially prepared for their ongoing rent obligations. Calling references can also give you a better sense of who your applicants are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8dontexpectprofitsimmediately\">8. Don’t Expect Profits Immediately</h2>\n<p>If you still have a mortgage on your property, chances are most of your rent payments will go toward the mortgage. Any extra usually goes toward maintenance and upkeep and whatever’s left over is your profit. But even without a lot of profit, your rental property is still valuable. All those rental payments help you build equity, which pays off over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9beclearaboutleaseviolations\">9. Be Clear About Lease Violations</h2>\n<p>Your lease should clearly state what happens when its terms are violated, including late rent, policy violations, and other lease agreements. Clearly outline the process for resolving these violations, such as a written warning, fines, or eviction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10takebeforeandafterphotos\">10. Take Before and After Photos</h2>\n<p>Take before and after photos of the property when tenants leave. While normal wear and tear is to be expected, you want to document damages that the deposit would cover. Photos are your best evidence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11findagreathandyman\">11. Find a Great Handyman</h2>\n<p>Your tenants are entitled to livable space and timely repairs. Even if that weren’t the case, you need to maintain the property to keep up its value. That’s easiest when you have a reliable handyman you can call for maintenance work. They can take care of the little things like leaky faucets or installing a new ceiling fan.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start? Check out this guide for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hiring contractors you can trust</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12installhardwoodflooring\">12. Install Hardwood Flooring</h2>\n<p>Hardwood flooding can be a big selling point for tenants, and it’s easier to clean and harder to stain or damage. Plus, that <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">renovation can increase your property’s value</a>. While you might be required to replace carpets after every few years, you can keep quality hardwood floors for years to come and new tenants will appreciate it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13makeacallonpets\">13. Make a Call on Pets</h2>\n<p>Every animal lover knows that pets can be a handful. Make a call on whether you’ll allow tenants to have pets in your property, and outline those rules clearly in your lease. This might be a no-pet policy or one <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">limiting types of breeds</a> or animals. Or you might allow any kind of pet – your property, your call!</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you’ll need to decide if a pet deposit or pet rent is enough to clean and repair the home after the tenant leaves. The problem is that you really won’t know until after the fact, so it’s something to consider in advance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14prepareforvacancies\">14. Prepare for Vacancies</h2>\n<p>If you go years without a vacancy, consider yourself lucky. Most of the time, you have to prepare for months where you’ll have to cover the mortgage without rental income to offset it. Develop a contingency plan or savings fund for these lean periods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15gettherightinsurance\">15. Get the Right Insurance</h2>\n<p>Protecting your investment property shouldn’t be an afterthought. If you rent out your second home, you might think you just need a regular homeowners insurance policy. But you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> for this situation. It protects the property’s structure, other structures on the premises (like sheds and fences), lost rental income, and liability. Notably, it doesn’t cover all the belongings inside the property – that’s a job for your tenant’s <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">renters policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Need a quote now?

      title: "7 Thanksgiving disasters (and how to avoid them)"
      body: "<p>Thanksgiving is a time to gather and share blessings with family and friends, but extra people around the table often means increased risk for the homeowners. We’ve compiled a list of the most common Thanksgiving disasters so that you can avoid them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1turkeyfryerfires\">1. Turkey fryer fires</h2>\n<p>Each year, more than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2012/11/21/top-10-u-s-states-for-turkey-fryer-fires/\" text=\"1,000 turkey fryer fires\" >}} ruin Thanksgiving. That’s hardly a surprise considering you’re dropping a raw bird into a vat of hot oil. But the potential explosion from not drying or thawing your turkey sufficiently is only one of your risks. Turkey fryers can also start fires if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use too much oil.</li>\n<li>Knock over the fryer.</li>\n<li>Overheat the oil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, deep-fried turkey is delicious and a staple at many Thanksgiving tables. So if you can’t pass it up, you may be able to <a href=\"/blog/avoid-turkey-fryer-fires/\">avoid a turkey fryer fire</a> by thawing the bird completely, keeping flammables a safe distance away, and never overfilling the fryer. While you’re at it, keep the children far from this Thanksgiving tradition. In fact, clear the area when you’re about to plop the bird in the pot.</p>\n<p>If you do have a fire, use a fire extinguisher to put it out – never water. (In case we haven’t made this clear, water and oil don’t mix.) And then call your representative because your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can usually cover the damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2homethefts\">2. Home thefts</h2>\n<p>According to {{< external-link url=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/understanding-the-reality-of-holiday-related-crimes-49947\" text=\"reports\" >}} from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), robberies and personal larceny increase by about 20 percent during the holiday season. While this statistic focuses on the December holidays, it all starts with Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>Thieves know that you’re buying presents and may have more cash on hand. Plus, people are away from their homes more during the holidays, and that gives criminals ample opportunity to break in or swipe packages off of porches.</p>\n<p>You can protect yourself in a few different ways, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting a security system.</strong> This not only deters criminals, but it may earn you a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discount on your homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Using lights with timers.</strong> You can give the impression that you’re home pretty easily with today’s smart technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Canceling your mail.</strong> If you go away, even for a weekend, halt mail service or ask a friend to pick up your deliveries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is burglarized, your homeowners insurance may be able to provide coverage for what was stolen, including items that were in your car away from your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3foodpoisoning\">3. Food poisoning</h2>\n<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/index.html\" text=\"48 million people\" >}} get sick from foodborne pathogens every year. And with the number of amateur chefs making full-blown feasts, Thanksgiving may be the national championship of food poisoning.</p>\n<p>The most likely culprit of this Thanksgiving disaster is probably undercooked turkey. It can easily spread bacteria through much of your Thanksgiving dinner if you’re not careful about cross-contamination.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the CDC provides a host of food safety tips to keep your guests safe, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thaw your turkey safely and completely.</strong> Turkeys generally take 24 hours per pound to defrost, so buy your bird early. And never leave it on the counter. The safest way is in your refrigerator, but you can also defrost it in a leak-proof bag in a sink full of cold water as long as you change the water every 30 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Handle your turkey safely.</strong> You need to wash your hands thoroughly before handling raw turkey, and never let any utensil, cutting board, dish, or other surface that’s touched raw turkey come into contact with any other part of your meal, whether it’s cooked or not.</li>\n<li><strong>Cook your defrosted turkey completely.</strong> To kill any bacteria in your turkey, make sure that it is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. You can check this by putting a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of your turkey’s breast, wing, and thigh.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4kitchenfires\">4. Kitchen fires</h2>\n<p>Kitchen are busy places on Thanksgiving Day, and it shows in an increase for fire risk. US fire departments responded to approximately {{< external-link url=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/snapshot_thanksgiving.pdf\" text=\"2,400 residential fires\" >}} on every Thanksgiving Day between 2014 and 2016. That’s more than double the average number of residential fires on all days.</p>\n<p>Protect your home and your loved ones by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watching where you set down towels and other flammable items.</li>\n<li>Never leaving food cooking on your stovetop unattended.</li>\n<li>Keeping a lid near your stove as you cook so you can put out a fire.</li>\n<li>Asking someone to keep children and pets out of the kitchen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fire in your home can be absolutely devastating, but your homeowners insurance can help you recover. Once you pay your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>, your insurer helps pay to repair damaged parts of the kitchen and replace destroyed items like pans and appliances. And if you have to temporarily relocate, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> can help with additional living expenses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5animalliabilityincidents\">5. Animal liability incidents</h2>\n<p>Of course, your furry friend is a total sweetheart! But sometimes our pets’ behavior can be unpredictable. The increase in guests and busy scenarios that normally accompany the holidays can often trigger unexpected reactions. In fact, dog bites are likely more common than you think - according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/dog-bite-prevention\" text=\"more than 4.5 million people\" >}} are bitten by dogs each year.</p>\n<p>To help keep your pet and your guests safe, work on socializing and training them before the big day. During the celebrations, make sure you know where they are at all times and monitor their body language so you can remove them from any stressful situations. And before any gatherings, make sure to check that your policy includes <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability coverage</a> in case the unexpected does happen!</p>\n<h2 id=\"6cloggeddrainsandsewerbackups\">6. Clogged drains and sewer backups</h2>\n<p>You may know the rules in your own home, but do your guests? Maybe they’re used to having a garbage disposal when you don’t have one, or maybe they think it’s ok to put a little grease down their drains sometimes. They might even occasionally flush things in the toilet that belong in the garbage can.</p>\n<p>While a small drain mishap could make for a funny Thanksgiving story later, a big clog or backup could be a major headache. Luckily, if one of your guests makes a costly mistake, your home insurance may cover the damage with a <a href=\"/glossary/water-backup-coverage/\">water backup endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7guestinjuries\">7. Guest injuries</h2>\n<p>Burns from turkey fryer fires aren’t the only injury risk at your gathering. Guests could slip on frosty walkways outside, trip over loose rugs, or they might even just tip over after a little too much wining and dining.</p>\n<p>We know you’ll keep an eye on your loved ones to try to prevent any disasters, but accidents happen! Your home insurance can likely help pay the costs of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical expenses</a> like ambulance rides and emergency room visits if someone gets hurt during the celebration.</p>\n<p>With a little forethought and planning, you can avoid most Thanksgiving disasters. But if something bad does happen, your homeowners insurance policy may be able to help.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in November 2021.

      title: "48% of Homebuyers Don’t Factor in Climate Change"
      body: "<p>Buying a home is a big deal, so people usually have a lot of questions before they make an offer. They worry about affording the mortgage, and wonder if it’s near good schools. They look for a place that’s close to work and has all the rooms and space they need. And they want to know if the house is in good shape or if they’re going to have to get a new roof in a couple of years.</p>\n<p>All of these are smart questions to ask when buying a home, but there’s one more factor to consider: climate change. Our changing climate is causing stronger hurricanes, increased flooding, and more extreme temperatures, yet a recent survey showed that {{< external-link url=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-insurance-protect-against-extreme-164904980.html\" text=\"48 percent of new homeowners\" >}} don’t think about that before they buy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homebuyersignoreclimatechangedespitenaturaldisasterconcerns\">Homebuyers Ignore Climate Change Despite Natural Disaster Concerns</h2>\n<p>There appears to be a pretty big disconnect between the concerns homebuyers have and the actions they take when choosing where to live. While nearly half say climate change isn’t a factor in their decisions, the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/is-your-home-insurance-ready-for-extreme-weather/\" text=\"Realtor.com survey\" >}} also discovered that significant portions do have concerns about natural disasters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>39 percent worry about tornadoes.</li>\n<li>38 percent worry about floods.</li>\n<li>29 percent worry about hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s not just this survey that's sounding an alarm. In an interview with CNBC, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman claimed {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/homebuyers-not-worried-about-climate-change-redfin-ceo.html\" text=\"homebuyers aren’t taking climate change seriously\" >}}.</p>\n<p>The problem with this, as Kelman pointed out, is that buyers “keep marching into the jaws of destruction,” even if their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> doesn’t cover the havoc that ensues. Plus, as more people move into high-risk areas, insurance companies have to cover more frequent and more expensive claims. This drives up premiums, sometimes to the extent that homeowners can’t find the coverage they need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretobuypropertywithclimatechangeinmind\">Where to Buy Property with Climate Change in Mind</h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">major report</a>, the climate is changing everywhere, so how can you decide where to buy property? You may want to start by identifying what areas of the country interest you and researching what experts have to say about the impact climate change may have on them.</p>\n<p>SafeHome.org compiled data from Climate Central and came up with a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.safehome.org/climate-change-statistics/\" text=\"Climate Change Rate Index\" >}} to evaluate states by five major risk categories and their effects: extreme heat, drought, wildfire, coastal flooding, and inland flooding. It found the five states with the lowest Climate Change Rate Index were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vermont (30).</li>\n<li>New Hampshire (63).</li>\n<li>Massachusetts (99).</li>\n<li>Minnesota (104) .</li>\n<li>Colorado (106).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the states with the highest risk are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida (308).</li>\n<li>South Carolina (282).</li>\n<li>Louisiana (281).</li>\n<li>North Carolina (276).</li>\n<li>Mississippi (270).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>States in the Northeast have the lowest risk, with an average Climate Rate Index of 123, followed by the Midwest (147) and West (166). The South, with an average Climate Change Index of 226, has the greatest risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsuranceforpropertieswithclimaterisk\">Home Insurance for Properties with Climate Risk</h2>\n<p>Once you have an idea of how climate change may impact the area where you want to buy property, you can identify the specific risks you’re most likely to face and determine if homeowners insurance covers your potential catastrophes.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how home insurance covers some of the more common natural disasters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wind damage, including that from tornadoes, is typically covered.</strong> However, if you live in a hurricane-prone area you may have a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> on top of your standard deductible. Some insurance companies also add a <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a> in certain areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Water damage is usually only covered if it’s caused by a sudden, internal accident, like a burst pipe, or occurs because of damage caused by another</strong> <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\"><strong>covered peril</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Flooding from storm surge, overflowing rivers and streams, and other external sources almost always requires <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. Flood insurance may also be required if you live in a high-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wildfires are being excluded by more and more insurers,</strong> so you may find it hard to get home insurance if you’re in a known <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire zone</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Snow and ice damage is often covered,</strong> but you may see your claim denied if you allow snow or ice to build up, and it causes water to seep into your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Areas such as Utah can get both severe winter blizzards and seasonal thunderstorms that produce significant flooding. The Midwest has seen serious flooding in both 2019 and 2020, and large swaths of California, Colorado, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas all saw {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn\" text=\"wildfires in 2021\" >}}.</p>\n<p>When you find a home you want to buy, ask the real estate agent about climate change and natural disasters common in the area. Will rising ocean levels pose a problem to your land? What drainage features exist to prevent flooding with significant rainfall? Do you have to be concerned about hurricane season each year? If so, in what ways?</p>\n<h2 id=\"isclimatechangeadealbreakertobuyingahome\">Is Climate Change a Deal Breaker to Buying a Home?</h2>\n<p>Knowing the facts about <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change and how it might affect a new property</a> doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. But you do need to be fully aware of the risks you face so you can make an educated decision.</p>\n<p>There are many things you can do to reduce the potential effects of climate change disasters on your new home. Arm yourself with the data so that you can research mitigation options for your property. In the end, you may still feel it’s worth the risk to buy a dream home, but at least you’ll be prepared for the worst case scenario.</p>"

      body: "<p>To celebrate Black History Month, we built a list of Black interior designers who are shaping modern home trends and making history as we speak. Find out what inspires these influential designers and the trademarks of their unique styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1chanaerichards\">1. Chanae Richards</h2>\n<p>Prior to opening {{< external-link url=\"https://www.olorointeriors.com/\" text=\"ọlọrọ interiors\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/olorointeriors/\" text=\"@olorointeriors\" >}}), Chanae Richards had no idea she even wanted to be in design. Her degree was in public financial management, but curating a friend’s gallery ignited her interest in design, and her success in the project drove her to make a business of her new-found passion.</p>\n<p>Richards does not share photos of the work she does for clients. She describes her own style as minimalist, but don’t mistake that for boring. Her goal is to bring richness to minimalism, and she does so with bold colors, striking patterns, and strong lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2leydenlewis\">2. Leyden Lewis</h2>\n<p>Brooklyn-born Leyden Lewis is the founder and creative director of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.leydenlewis.com/\" text=\"Leyden Lewis Design Studio\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/leydenlewisdesignstudio\" text=\"@leydenlewisdesignstudio\" >}}). He’s also a trained architect and artist, but his list of accomplishments doesn’t end there. Leyden Lewis Design Studio made Elle Decor’s list of 125 top interior designers in 2019 and 2020 and Architectural Digest’s AD100 in 2021. Add to that the titles of educator, art consultant, and founding member of the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.badguild.info/\" text=\"Black Artists and Designers Guild\" >}}, and you can see why Lewis is so influential.</p>\n<p>Lewis’ background in fine arts is evident in his design aesthetic, where he weaves contemporary artwork and sculptural pieces to create meaningful spaces for his clients. Ultimately, he combines his expertise in each discipline in dramatic yet functional design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3nicolegibbons\">3. Nicole Gibbons</h2>\n<p>“Approachable sophistication” is perhaps the best way to describe Nicole Gibbons’ ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicolegibbonsstyle\" text=\"@nicolegibbonsstyle\" >}}) design style. Her work combines classic lines and neutral tones with rich pops of color for a light atmosphere with a modern edge.</p>\n<p>Gibbons has taken the fun, collaborative attitude of her full-service design firm {{< external-link url=\"http://www.nicolegibbonsstyle.com/\" text=\"Nicole Gibbons Style\" >}} to several other endeavors, including her lifestyle blog and modern paint brand Clare. When Gibbons isn’t working as an interior designer, she’s sharing tips and trends on top media outlets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4jeaninehaysbryanmason\">4. Jeanine Hays &amp; Bryan Mason</h2>\n<p>Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason on the husband-and-wife team behind {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aphrochic.com/\" text=\"AphroChic\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/aphrochic\" text=\"@aphrochic\" >}} ), a blog-turned-brand that marries modern design with history and global culture. The couple’s interests span several creative fields, including interior design, fashion, and content creation, and in 2019, they launched AphroChic magazine to bring all of these onto one platform.</p>\n<p>As interior designers, Hays and Mason work to tell a story through a neutral palette highlighted with colorful accent pieces, antiques, and global artifacts while maintaining a modern aesthetic. In addition to being named one of New York’s top interior design firms, AphroChic styled the first ever African American concept house on the west coast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5carmeonhamilton\">5. Carmeon Hamilton</h2>\n<p>Carmeon Hamilton ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/carmeonhamilton\" text=\"@carmeonhamilton\" >}}) is known for several achievements. Not only is she a top interior designer, content creator, blogger, public speaker, and merchandise consultant, Hamilton won HGTV’s “Design Star: Next Gen” and currently hosts the network’s “Reno My Rental.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton describes herself as a modern bohemian, a concept that shines through in her work as the creative lead of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.carmeonhamilton.com/nubiinteriors\" text=\"Nubi Interiors\" >}}. By laying muted colors, bold patterns, and earthy textiles, she creates designs that evoke a sense of serenity and wellbeing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6tiffanybrooks\">6. Tiffany Brooks</h2>\n<p>Tiffany Brooks ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiffanybrooksinteriors/\" text=\"@tiffanybrooksinteriors\" >}}) is a passionate designer based in the suburbs of Chicago. She founded her firm {{< external-link url=\"https://www.tiffanybrooksinteriors.com/\" text=\"Tiffany Brooks Interiors\" >}} in 2007 with the mission to create stunning living environments that encompass clients’ individual needs and unique styles.</p>\n<p>Since launching, her work has been featured in Architectural Digest, HGTV Magazine, Essence, Domino, Forbes and elsewhere. She is also the host and designer of HGTV’s Smart Home, and in 2013 she was named the winner of competition show HGTV Design Star.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7brigetteromanek\">7. Brigette Romanek</h2>\n<p>Brigette Romanek ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/brigetteromanek/\" text=\"@brigetteromanek\" >}}) is one of Los Angeles’ most sought-after interior designers and the founder of {{< external-link url=\"https://romanekdesignstudio.com/\" text=\"Romanek Design Studio\" >}}.

      title: "5 Grass Alternatives so You Can Sell Your Lawn Mower"
      body: "<p>For some homeowners, a well-maintained lawn is just as important as a white picket fence and two-car garage. But for all the joyful moments that patch of grass may bring, it can cause just as many headaches. Traditional grass lawns take a lot of work, and much of that effort damages the environment through pesticides, fertilizer, and wasted water.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are plenty of grass alternatives that look beautiful, are easy to maintain, and minimize your impact on our planet. We investigated alternatives to lawns and came up with seven options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1ornamentalgrass\">1. Ornamental Grass</h2>\n<p>Drought-resistant and incredibly low-maintenance ornamental grasses, like New Zealand flax or Mexican feather grass, are ideal for homeowners who want to feel like their home sits in a beautiful field. There are several varieties, some of which can grow up to 15 feet tall, so you want to research what works best for your zone.</p>\n<p>Once planted, ornamentals don't need to be mowed and almost never require fertilizer. The one downside is that you can’t really walk on. That means you either need to keep your yard off limits or build a path through it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2moss\">2. Moss</h2>\n<p>Moss may be the perfect option if your yard doesn’t get a lot of sun. It’s already a drought-resistant plant, and with the right amount of shade, moss doesn’t need watering. Moreover, moss is resilient and can handle some foot traffic, making it more like a traditional yard. These characteristics make moss a good choice for areas where severe drought conditions occur regularly.</p>\n<p>You can choose from dozens of moss varieties, and most never grow higher than one inch. That eliminates the need for mowing. Even better, moss is one of the few grass alternatives that is super easy to install.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3groundcover\">3. Ground Cover</h2>\n<p>Ground cover is a term that describes plants, often perennials, that creep along the ground but don’t grow in height. Because they stay low to the ground and grow with a minimal amount of effort, most are excellent to use as an alternative to a lawn. Common examples of plants used a ground cover include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clover.</li>\n<li>Hosta.</li>\n<li>Creeping myrtle.</li>\n<li>Wild violet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ground cover often has other benefits. For example, flowering ground cover can attract pollinators. Again, ground cover describes several types of plants, so be sure to research what’s appropriate for your zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4flowerandshrubbeds\">4. Flower and Shrub Beds</h2>\n<p>You most likely wouldn’t replace all of your grass with flower and shrub beds, but using them in your yard reduces the amount of space dedicated to a traditional lawn. The other big benefit here is curb appeal. Brightly colored flowers and shrubs of various heights can add visual interest that people find attractive.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that the degree of maintenance required depends on the types of flowers and shrubs you plant. You could be watering just as much as you would a lawn unless you try your hand at <a href=\"/blog/sustainable-gardening-ideas/\">sustainable gardening</a>. For example, choosing native perennials usually means you need less water and fertilizer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5nograssalternatives\">5. No-Grass Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Some homeowners have found that the best grass alternative is no lawn at all. In many cases, this means adding simple hardscaping that can <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">boost your curb appeal</a>, like a :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Path out of gravel or stone.</li>\n<li>Rock garden.</li>\n<li>Retaining wall.</li>\n<li>Patio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But some forgo grass altogether, opting instead for yards filled with gravel or sand. Another option that may work if you’re looking for something with absolutely no maintenance is artificial turf. Once you install it, there’s no water, sun, or weeding required. The big downside to artificial turf is the cost, which can be anywhere from five dollars to $20 per square foot. However, artificial turf can last a long time, keeping its appeal for up to 25 years.</p>\n<p>A yard without any grass isn’t for everyone, but the idea is becoming more popular in areas where drought makes it difficult to keep a lawn looking healthy. Artificial turf, rocks, and other nonliving grass alternatives are great options in many areas of the country.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that no one is asking you to give up your yard completely. Simply adding one or more of these grass alternatives can make your lawn easier to maintain while you also help out Mother Nature. One note of caution before you make the switch: your homeowners association may have rules about your yard, so check with it first!</p>"

      title: "5 Halloween Safety Tips to Keep Scares Away"
      body: "<p>From pumpkin carving to crowds of ghosts and goblins descending upon your street, Halloween is fun for all ages. But the tendency toward mischief can mean extra risk for homeowners. Protect your home and family from trouble (and <a href=\"/blog/halloween-home-insurance-claims/\">halloween insurance claims</a>!) with these seven Halloween safety tips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1guardagainstvandalism\">1. Guard Against Vandalism</h2>\n<p>Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you may actually get tricked if you don’t hand out treats. And while a smashed jack-o’-lantern is annoying, it’s nothing compared to the damage some vandals can do on Halloween night. Protect against these nighttime mischief-makers by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping your porch lights on.</li>\n<li>Taping over your mailbox.</li>\n<li>Parking your car in the garage.</li>\n<li>Sitting outside during trick-or-treat hours.</li>\n<li>Installing motion sensor lights and cameras.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a bonus, a well-lit home and walkway reduces the chance of injuries for trick-or-treaters and visitors you actually want to stop by on All Hallow's Eve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2placepumpkinsproperly\">2. Place Pumpkins Properly</h2>\n<p>Jack-o’-lanterns make great decorations, but they can tip over easily and cause a fire, so you want to be smart about where you put them. Setting candle-lit pumpkins along your walkway when you expect kids in costume to come by is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n<p>The safer bet is to use glow sticks or flameless candles, and make sure you clear the area of debris so there’s less flammable material around. Or better yet, keep the lit jack-o’-lanterns inside your home. Either way, never leave a lit pumpkin unattended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keeppartygoerssafe\">3. Keep Partygoers Safe</h2>\n<p>For the over-21 crowd, Halloween night rivals only New Year’s Eve and St. Patrick’s Day as an occasion to imbibe. But having friends over for a few libations can actually turn into a lawsuit for the homeowner. Not only can you be held responsible for a friend’s injury if they’ve been over-served, but in some states, you can be held liable for your inebriated partygoer’s actions beyond your house.</p>\n<p>You can minimize this trouble by having hearty appetizers on hand and offering nonalcoholic drinks. Another tip: refrain from drinking yourself.

The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/foodallergies/index.htm\" text=\"most serious allergic reactions\" >}} in the United States are caused by milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts.

Pay Attention to Costume Safety</h2>\n<p>Dressing up is a big part of Halloween fun, so don’t let the good times be marred by a costume that puts you or your little ones at risk. Pick a costume that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fits well.</strong> Baggy or oversized costumes are a tripping hazard.</li>\n<li><strong>Doesn’t limit vision or restrict breathing.</strong> Make sure you try on masks so you know if you can see and breathe well.</li>\n<li><strong>Is flame retardant or resistant.</strong> A store-bought costume should have this phrase clearly stated on the label. Otherwise, consider clothing that is polyester or nylon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you can’t find a flame-resistant costume, you may want to try this do-it-yourself solution to increase your safety:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine seven ounces of Borax with three ounces of boric acid in two quarts of warm water.</li>\n<li>Dip your costume in the mixture until it is fully saturated and wring out by hand.</li>\n<li>Hang to dry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mixture <strong>does not</strong> make your costume fireproof, just fire retardant (i.e., slow to burn when exposed to flame). It also only lasts until the fabric is washed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5takecareoffido\">5. Take Care of Fido</h2>\n<p>Trick-or-treaters may bring you all kinds of joy, but your dog might not love it when the doorbell rings fifty times in one night. The onslaught of visitors can make your furry friend anxious, so make sure they’re locked up safe and sound throughout All Hallow’s Eve to minimize the chance of Fido making a break for it while you’re handing out candy. Doing so can also keep tiny hands safe from fear-driven bites and you safe from a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"/blog/halloween-safety-tips-covid-19/\">COVID put the kibosh on last year’s festivities</a>, 2022 is the year for people to go out and enjoy again﹘assuming, of course, your local health department has given its okay.

      title: "5 Roof Shapes Every Homeowner Should Know"
      body: "<p>Most homeowners don’t think much about the shape of their roof. After all, as long as it looks good and doesn’t leak, everything should be fine, right?</p>\n<p>The truth is your roof shape affects <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">your home’s ability to withstand high winds</a> and other natural hazards that may be common in your area. In fact, you’ll often see more of a certain type of roof shape in a particular area because of the climate. Gable roofs, for example, are more common in rainy climates because the steep pitch prevents water from getting in the house.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the following roof shapes to understand how yours might affect you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gable\">Gable</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/gable-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Gable roofs are one of the most common types of roof shapes you’ll find on a home, in part because they have a simple design and are affordable to build. They have two sloping sides that meet at the top ridge to form a triangle. Essentially, the house with a gable roof has two walls that are rectangular and two walls that are triangular to meet the pitch.</p>\n<p>These are additional styles of gable roofs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>False-front gable roof:</strong> This type of roof uses one or more gables to give the appearance of a gabled roof, typically to improve curb appeal by extending the roof line above the actual shallow-pitched roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-gable roof:</strong> A roof is called cross-gabled when it has two or more gable roof lines that intersect. The ridges typically run perpendicular to each other to form an L- or T-shaped roof.</li>\n<li><strong>Shed roof:</strong> Instead of two sections meeting at a point to form a triangle, a shed roof, also called a skillion, slants in one direction. Think of it as a high back wall with a steep pitch coming forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Gable with curves:</strong> Adding curved elements to a gable roof, like eyebrow dormers, create softer lines in the overall look of the house. However, doing this means you can’t use metal roofing that comes in panels. Shingles in most materials should work fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A gable roof’s pitch means it’s a pretty good choice for rainy climates because the slop helps the house shed water. Unfortunately, they aren’t great in hurricanes. In a significant storm, gable roofs are more susceptible to wind damage than other types of roofs, so having one can affect your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hip\">Hip</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/hip-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A hip roof is similar to a gable roof except that the hip roof has four sides that slant downwards. This makes for an interesting look, plus there are no valleys where leaves can collect, which helps with maintenance.</p>\n<p>Hips roofs are sturdy and wind resistant, so you often see them in areas where there are frequent storms. Because the roof is four-sided, wind pressure is spread evenly throughout the perimeter of the roof, unlike a gable, which concentrates wind pressure in its topmost point.</p>\n<p>However, you should note that hip roofs cost more to build than a gable roof and home prices will reflect that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gambrel\">Gambrel</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/gambrel-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Though technically a type of gable roof, these deserve their own mention. Also called a barn roof, gambrel roofs have two different slopes and are often used in Dutch Colonial and Georgian <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">style homes</a>. The top sloping section is usually less steep than the bottom sloping section to maximize living space under the roof. Gambrel roofs also have narrow eaves that are heavily slanted.</p>\n<p>Because of their open shape, gambrel roofs aren’t ideal for homes in high-wind regions. Like gable roofs, high winds can get leverage under the roof and force it upward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flat\">Flat</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/flat-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As its name suggests, a flat roof is, well, flat. These roofs have nearly no pitch, which allows for extra living space, like a rooftop garden. However, the lack of pitch also makes these roofs susceptible to damage from heavy rainfall or the weight of ice and snow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mansard\">Mansard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/mansard-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>From the ground, a mansard roof looks like a lot like a hip roof with four steeply sloping side. However, it actually has another section that has a gentler pitch at the top. This is a common feature in French-styled homes. The low-pitched top section makes mansard roofs a good option in areas that get a lot of snow.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a house, you definitely want to pay attention to the available roof shapes and look for one that provides both style and the appropriate protection. And if you’re already a homeowner, you can check out some <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">additional tips for making your home more wind resistant</a>.</p>"

      body: "<p>Experiencing a flood is devastating for homeowners. Not only is the damage expensive and extensive, but floodwaters can make an area dangerous.</p>\n<p>How can you ensure your family is safe to return home after a flood? These five pointers can help you build a plan of action to get repairs underway and get back on your feet after a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Please remember:</strong> Don’t return to your home if the evacuation order is still in effect. Wait until authorities give the all-clear before you head back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1figureoutifyoureinadisasterarea\">1. Figure out if you’re in a disaster area</h2>\n<p>If your region is considered a disaster area, you will have access to more resources to help accelerate your hazard-free move in. These may include financial services, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\" text=\"assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\" >}} (FEMA), and public services to help shoulder the cost of flood repairs and cleanup.</p>\n<p>FEMA has several {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual/program\" text=\"programs for individuals and households\" >}} that can help you recover from a flood. For example, you may be able to get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funds for temporary housing.</li>\n<li>A temporary housing unit.</li>\n<li>Money to help you repair or replace your home and personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Hazard mitigation assistance to make your home stronger and more durable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information at {{< external-link url=\"http://www.disasterassistance.gov/\" text=\"DisasterAssistance.gov\" >}} or by calling FEMA at 800-621-3362.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2waitfortheallclear\">2. Wait for the all clear</h2>\n<p>You need to wait for the authorities to give you an all clear before you return to your home. That will tell you the imminent danger of the flood is gone and you can safely return to your home.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that cracks in your foundation can cause gas leaks and other issues. As a precaution, have your gas supplier shut off the gas until the property has been investigated for leaks. Your water supplier can also let you know when the water is safe to consume again.</p>\n<p>Anything that plugs into an electrical outlet needs to be inspected, thoroughly cleaned, and dried by an electrician before you try to use it. This can prevent electronics shorts and possible electrocution from damaged items. If you are unsure how high the water rose, err on the side of safety before using any electronics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3contactyourinsurancecompany\">3. Contact your insurance company</h2>\n<p>You must have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> in place before your home experiences a flood to draw on your coverage. This protection is the difference between resuming your life as quickly as possible and struggling to make the expensive repairs needed to make your home habitable again.</p>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> does not provide flood coverage. Most insurers sell this coverage as a separate policy (Kin adds flood insurance as an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your homeowners policy). If you have <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a>, consider getting this coverage as soon as possible. Don’t wait until after a flood has occurred – your coverage can’t retroactively cover flood damage.</p>\n<p>Payouts for severe damage can take up to six months, so it’s best to call your insurance company as soon as you know you will need to make a flood claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4surveythewaterdamage\">4. Survey the water damage</h2>\n<p>Whatever you do, don’t wade or swim through standing water. If your home has standing water, make accommodations to stay elsewhere until the home is drained and accessible.</p>\n<p>Once the home is safe to survey, assess the damage. Some common issues to look for after a home is flooded include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A cracked foundation.</li>\n<li>Jammed windows and doors.</li>\n<li>Soaked insulation.</li>\n<li>Weak drywall.</li>\n<li>Wrecked electrical systems.</li>\n<li>Ruined appliances and furniture.</li>\n<li>Moldy carpets.</li>\n<li>Warped wooden floors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these issues may be hard to spot on your own, such as the foundation and insulation. However, take note of the problems you can easily spot without putting yourself in harm’s way. Stay away from the electric (you’ll want to leave that to a professional), but do note which outlets were underwater – they will need to be replaced.</p>\n<p>There are things you can do to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prevent-mold-after-a-flood/\">prevent mold after a flood</a>. However, if you encounter black mold, document it and call a professional to get it removed right away.</p>\n<p>Also be aware that infestations are common after a flood (like snakes – yikes!). Wear rubber gloves and boots while you survey the damage and keep an eye out for unwelcome critters.</p>\n<p>Lastly, ensure water coming from your faucets is not toxic. Your utility company can confirm when the water is safe again. Until then, boil water before drinking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5documentthedamage\">5. Document the damage</h2>\n<p>Before you start repairs, document the damage that has been done to your home. Take pictures or use video to document what will need to be replaced. This will help you make the case for maximum coverage for your lost items.</p>\n<p>During a crisis, it’s important to have a plan to avoid further danger or losses. Make sure good insurance coverage is part of that plan. Be sure to go over your recovery plan with your family so they know what to expect after a disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in August 2018.

      title: "5 Types of Foundations for Homes"
      body: "<p>Your home’s foundation does more than hold your house above ground – it can also keep out moisture, resist earth movement, and help insulate the home. It’s called a foundation for a reason – it’s the most important structural component of the home! Different types of foundations for homes may serve different purposes, and knowing which yours has may be helpful when you apply for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore the different types of foundations and how you can identify which your home has.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1concreteslabfoundation\">1. Concrete Slab Foundation</h2>\n<p>Concrete slabs are one of the most common and most cost-effective types of foundation for homes. Builders clear and level the ground, and then pour anywhere from four to eight inches of concrete and install drainage pipes and steel rods to reinforce the foundation. This prevents the concrete from cracking later on. The structure is then built directly on the concrete slab.</p>\n<p>You know if you have a concrete slab foundation because there is no space between the cement and the floor. This type of foundation is also fairly low, so you need good drainage to prevent flooding. That said, concrete slab foundations are good for preventing mold and pests because there’s no air between the home and the foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2crawlspacefoundation\">2. Crawlspace Foundation</h2>\n<p>A crawlspace foundation is commonly used where the soil is difficult to dig. It raises the home upon concrete pillars that provide just enough space for someone to crawl under the house﹘usually four feet or less. This is how homeowners get to their plumbing or electrical components. Homes on crawl space foundations are less likely to see significant damage in areas where the groundwater is high. By lifting the living area of a home above the waterline, the owner can save on costly repairs or avoid making <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">home insurance claims</a>.</p>\n<p>A homeowner can usually tell that they have a crawlspace foundation if they have several steps leading to their front door. A quick look under the house also reveals the pillars the structure sits on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3elevatedpierspilingsfoundation\">3. Elevated Piers/Pilings Foundation</h2>\n<p>Similar to a crawl space, a piers or pilings foundation raises a home up, but as the name suggests, it uses piers or pilings to do it. Builders drive the pilings into the ground and place pile caps, typically made of concrete, across several pilings so that the weight of the structure is distributed among them.</p>\n<p>This type of foundation is commonly used where putting in other foundations isn’t possible, like the side of a hill where digging uniform sections is difficult or coastal areas where the soil shifts. They’re a durable way to secure a home and prevent flood damage because everything is elevated. Workers also have an easy time accessing home systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4basementfoundation\">4. Basement Foundation</h2>\n<p>Basement foundations are built by digging down about eight feet and either pouring concrete or laying bricks or concrete blocks. The space typically matches the footprint of the home and can be used for storage or made into additional living space. In fact, you can tell you have a basement because you can easily maneuver around it, walking freely under your house.</p>\n<p>Aside from storage and additional living space, most builders also put the electrical, plumbing, and heating systems in the basement. Basements help keep a home cooler during warm weather by providing a place for air to flow. However, basements are more expensive than other foundations and require maintenance to prevent moisture, structural deterioration, and mold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5elevatedwithenclosurefoundation\">5. Elevated-with-Enclosure Foundation</h2>\n<p>An elevated-with-enclosure foundation raises a home above ground level and leaves an area of usable space. A good example is a home built over the garage or workshop. The space under the home is enclosed, may have a separate entrance than from the main home, and is often not a livable area. Additionally, the foundation may have flood openings.</p>\n<p>This is a good foundation type for areas that work with the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> and have a <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevation</a>. If water levels rise, the main living area is typically protected from damage.</p>\n<p>Before you apply for home insurance, take a quick look at your foundation. The more accurate you are when answering questions about the type of foundation your home has, the more accurate your quote will be.</p>"

      title: "9 Florida ghost towns to visit this fall"
      body: "<p>Looking for the perfect Halloween adventure? Take a trip to some of the eeriest abandoned towns in the Sunshine State. These Florida ghost towns are filled with history and intrigue – and probably a few spirits, too. Enter if you dare!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1anonainpinellascounty\">1. Anona in Pinellas County</h2>\n<p>While the town established by Captain John Thomas Lowe disappeared into nearby Largo, you can still visit several remaining structures. These include a still-active church and the cemetery where many of its original settlers are buried.</p>\n<p>A short drive takes you to Heritage Village where you can tour the {{< external-link url=\"http://www.pinellascounty.org/Heritage/lowe_house.htm\" text=\"Lowe House\" >}}, a classic example of a homestead house. This simple and efficient <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">type of home</a> was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century and can usually be identified by its gabled roof and batten siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2slaviainseminolecounty\">2. Slavia in Seminole County</h2>\n<p>Slavia was established by Slovakian immigrants who banded together to purchase the plot of land and move their children away from the temptations found in large cities. The hard work of turning wet woodlands into successful farms drove many of the new settlers aways, but those who stayed were able to create the community they sought.</p>\n<p>Today, no residents live in Slavia, but you can visit its oldest remaining building: St. Luke’s Lutheran Church. Built in 1912, the church building was originally a worker shack. This structure has been renovated several times and still sits at the edge of Slavia’s cemetery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3zioninpalmbeachcounty\">3. Zion in Palm Beach County</h2>\n<p>Zion is probably best known for being the site of one Florida’s Houses of Refuge. Beginning in 1870, these houses were essentially life-saving stations for sailors shipwrecked along Florida’s mainly barren eastern coast. Zion’s Orange Grove House of Refuge #3 was in service for 20 years. The government rented the building to new settlers until 1927 when the structure was destroyed in a fire.</p>\n<p>Zion may also be one of the few Florida ghost towns with the potential for actual ghost sightings. Orange Grove House of Refuge #3 is also where {{< external-link url=\"https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/13412\" text=\"barefoot mailman\" >}} James “Ed” Hamilton stayed the night before he disappeared near the Hillsboro Inlet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4holopawinosceolacounty\">4. Holopaw in Osceola County</h2>\n<p>In 1928, JM Griffin Lumber Company bought a plot of land near the Florida East Coast Railway Kissimmee Valley extension and opened a sawmill. Next came housing, which the company leased to its employees and ultimately became the town of Holopaw, a Creek word that means “walkway” or “pavement.”</p>\n<p>The town thrived with the lumber industry, hitting a population of 2,000 at its peak. But then the timber ran out, the railroad discontinued service, and Holopaw dwindled into a ghost town. It’s remained that way since the Great Depression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5olympiainmartincounty\">5. Olympia in Martin County</h2>\n<p>Olympia may be the only Florida city that has never been anything but a ghost town. It was the grand idea of a banker who hoped to build a Greek-inspired second Hollywood during Florida’s real estate boom of the 1920s.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his timing was terrible. The boom went bust just a few years after architect Maurice Fatio began working on the project, followed by a hurricane in 1928. The remnants of this Florida ghost town are mainly found in streets named for Greek and Roman gods throughout Old Hobe Sound.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6fortdadeinhillsboroughcounty\">6. Fort Dade in Hillsborough County</h2>\n<p>Fort Dade was built in 1899 on Egmont Key to defend the Tampa Bay area during the Spanish-American War. But even before that, the stretch of land was home to a lighthouse, a series of military outposts, and an internment camp for Seminole prisoners. The city had over 300 residents at one time, plus a hospital, jail, bowling alley, and more. Now people can explore four abandoned fort structures by taking a ferry or boat to Egmont Key.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7okeelantainpalmbeachcounty\">7. Okeelanta in Palm Beach County</h2>\n<p>Okeelanta was founded in 1913 with the intention of converting Everglades into usable farmlands. After some initial struggle farming in wetlands, the original settlers were successful with a variety of crops, including sugarcane, corn, beans, and tomatoes, and the town grew.</p>\n<p>However, Okeelanta’s 200 residents routinely battled floods and freezes, and the town’s population began to move away. Okeelanta was ultimately destroyed in 1928 by a hurricane. City founder Thomas Will attempted to rebuild but failed to get financing and Okeelanta ultimately disappeared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8kerrcityinmarioncounty\">8. Kerr City in Marion County</h2>\n<p>Kerr City was founded in 1884 as a stage coach stop for travelers commuting from the St. Johns River to Ocala. The town had 100 people at one point, as well as a hotel, general store, drug store, school, church, and post office.</p>\n<p>After the Great Freeze killed all the citrus plants in 1894 and 1895, most people moved away. The hotel burned down in 1907, while the post office operated until 1941 and is still standing. Many of the old homes have been renovated in recent years and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, the town is fenced off and visits by the general public aren’t allowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9hopewellinhillsboroughcounty\">9. Hopewell in Hillsborough County</h2>\n<p>Hopewell (originally named Callsville) was founded as a plantation shortly before the Civil War. When the slaves were freed, the plantation was divided into smaller homesteads. Eventually, the town was abandoned - but no one seems to know why.</p>\n<p>Now it’s surrounded by citrus groves and the only buildings that remain are the church and cemetery, McDonald House, and the Hull House. Most of the town’s buildings have been overtaken by trees and vines, but some of the homes are still in decent shape for curious visitors.</p>\n<p>Were these abandoned places a little too tame for your taste?

      title: "7 Home Insurance Myths Busted"
      body: "<p><strong>“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” — Arthur Conan Doyle, <em>The Sign of Four</em></strong></p>\n<p>You shouldn’t have to be a super sleuth known for deductive reasoning to discover what your home insurance covers. But with all the conflicting information out there, how else can you tell fact from fiction?</p>\n<p>Put on your deerstalker hat and Inverness cape – the game’s afoot! Join us as we bust the seven most common home insurance myths and uncover the truth once and for all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth1homeownersinsuranceisrequiredbylaw\">Myth 1: Homeowners Insurance Is Required by Law</h2>\n<p>Having <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is important, but it isn’t required by state or federal law, despite what many people think. That said, you may still be required to get a policy if you have a <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>. Most lenders require home insurance because they have a financial interest in the property and want to protect it. If something were to happen to the home, they want to make sure that it gets repaired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth2homeownersinsurancecoversflood\">Myth 2: Homeowners Insurance Covers Flood</h2>\n<p>Home insurance policies typically exclude flood damage, but it’s easy to see why so many homeowners assume it’s covered. Most have been told their policy includes water damage, and what is a flood if not a whole lot of water? But in insurance, “<a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a>” generally means damage caused by water originating in your house, like a broken freezer or a burst pipe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is an expensive myth to fall for. When you consider how common and expensive flood damage is, <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood insurance is really for everyone</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth3anythingthatisstoleniscovered\">Myth 3: Anything That Is Stolen Is Covered</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance does cover stolen items, but there are limits to how much coverage is available. The first limit is how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> you decide to carry, which is usually between 20 to 50 percent of their dwelling coverage. So let’s say your policy ends up with $20,000 in personal property coverage. If a burglary at your home ends up costing more than $20,000, the difference won’t be covered.</p>\n<p>But there may be other limits on your personal property coverage, and that’s for certain high-end items. Many insurance companies have additional limits for particularly expensive property, such as jewelry, furs, rugs, and artwork, and those limits are often not enough to cover the loss. For example, you might only have $1,500 of coverage for fine jewelry, so you would be underinsured if you had any valuable jewelry.</p>\n<p>The solution is to increase the limits available in your homeowners policy when you have big-ticket belongings. You can do that with a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth4theonlywaytopaylessistogetlesscoverage\">Myth 4: The Only Way to Pay Less Is to Get Less Coverage</h2>\n<p>Most people assume that skimping on coverage is the only way to save money on your home insurance. That’s probably because many of the factors used to determine your premium are beyond your control, such as your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">Replacement cost estimate</a>.</li>\n<li>Location.</li>\n<li>Age.</li>\n<li>Size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you may find that many insurance companies offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>, especially to responsible homeowners. Another option is to increase your deductible. This increases your costs if you file a claim, but insurance companies typically reward this with a lower premium.</p>\n<p>If push comes to shove, however, you may want to shop around for a new insurance company. Granted, most insurers consider similar factors when setting your premium, but they can weigh them differently. Or perhaps just <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote</a> from us. We base your premium on <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">thousands of data points</a> to get a better understanding of the risk you present and a more accurate premium to cover it. Homeowners usually save money when they switch to us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth5selfinsuringismoreaffordablethaninsurance\">Myth 5: Self Insuring Is More Affordable Than Insurance</h2>\n<p>Self-insurance simply means that rather than buying a home insurance policy from a company, you decide to save enough money to pay for any damages you experience. That choice might be tempting if you’re particularly handy or work in construction. But while you may have no problem making small repairs, you might not be able to cover the costs of rebuilding your entire house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth6youmustinsureyourhomeforitsmarketvalue\">Myth 6: You Must Insure Your Home for Its Market Value</h2>\n<p>Believing in this myth may cost you quite a bit of money because it can lead you to pay for coverage you don’t actually need. The problem is that your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">market value and replacement value are seldom the same</a>. For example, a home you paid $500,000 might only cost $200,000 to rebuild. Insuring it for its current market value would result in too much home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"myth7homeinsurancecoverspestinfestations\">Myth 7: Home Insurance Covers Pest Infestations</h2>\n<p>Home insurance typically does not cover damage caused by termites, mice, bats, and other vermin. The issue for the insurance company is that infestations develop over time, so it expects you to deal with pests before they can damage your home. Essentially, dealing with rodents is part of regular home maintenance, and insurance companies don’t pay for damage caused by neglect or <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">normal wear and tear</a>.</p>\n<p>Regular upkeep on your home may seem daunting, but it’s an essential part of protecting your investments.

      title: "7 Interior Design Trends 2021: What’s In?"
      body: "<p>The pandemic forced many of us to stay home more than we usually would, and the interior design trends of 2021 reflect that. People want to create comfortable living spaces that also incorporate the realities of their new work-from-home lifestyle, according to many of the experts we asked. Here are seven of their interior design tips for staying on trend this year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1japandi\">1. Japandi</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/japandi.jpg\" alt=\"A japandi-style kitchen with wooden cabinets and island and muted tones\" /></p>\n<p>Japandi combines a Japanese esthetic with Scandinavian coziness and functionality.</p>\n<p>Because many of us are still working and living in one space, minimalist designs will stay popular, according to Tom Lawrence-Levy of {{< external-link url=\"http://naturalasthetik.com/about\" text=\"Natural Astehtik\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/naturalasthetik/\" text=\"@naturalasthetik\" >}}): “I really feel like in 2021 we'll continue seeing a lot of wabi-sabi and Japandi (Japanese-Scandinavian fusion) influence.”</p>\n<p>Japandi style combines Japanese minimalism with Scandinavian functionality, and tends to be warm and comforting. This means a design focus on natural elements﹘think lot of woods and muted color palettes﹘and cozy comfort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2cheerfulcolors\">2. Cheerful Colors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/colorful-home.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a living room with a bright yellow wall\" /></p>\n<p>Adding a pop of color, like the bright yellow wall in this living room, can lift your mood.</p>\n<p>You likely won’t see people opting to do a modern kitchen in all gray right now. People are looking to brighten their moods by using color in the spaces they spend the most time.</p>\n<p>“Colors indeed make us feel happy and positive. Recently, we are seeing more cheerful hues dominating the home,” says Emily Perez of {{< external-link url=\"https://kitcheninfinity.com/\" text=\"Kitchen Infinity\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/kitchen<em>infinity/\" text=\"@kitchen</em>infinity\" >}}). “Combinations of …yellow and gray and shades of blue and green are also trending in a big way.” Luckily, adding a fresh coat of paint is an easy and <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">inexpensive way to redecorate your home</a> and take part in this interior design trend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3lightandbreezyfabrics\">3. Light and Breezy Fabrics</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/curtains-living-room.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with pale gray transparent curtains, a velvet gray couch, and bright velvet throw pillows\" /></p>\n<p>The light curtains in the living room pair compliment the velvet of the couch.</p>\n<p>What your skin touches and your eyes see can greatly affect your mood. This is where fabric comes into play for design trends this year. According to Andra DelMonico of {{< external-link url=\"https://trendey.com/\" text=\"Trendey\" >}}, “Because people are spending more time at home, they are paying closer attention to the fabrics and materials in their homes. Popular fabrics in 2021 are those that are light and breezy.”</p>\n<p>Ideally, fabrics should have texture but still be soft to the touch. Even better, the texture should be visible and incorporate natural elements such as floral patterns. DelMonico says the goal is to create “visual interest in the room while adding a feeling of coziness.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"4maximalism\">4. Maximalism</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/maximalist-design.jpg\" alt=\"A a maximalist living room with multiple colored rugs, striped curtains, and several wall hangings\" /></p>\n<p>Maximalism embraces more of everything, including colors and patterns.</p>\n<p>Andre Kazimierski of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.improovy.com/\" text=\"Improovy\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/improovyit/\" text=\"@improovyit\" >}}) says he’s seeing minimalist designs being converted into maximalist designs. “Maximalism is seen through having a lot of decor, colorful paint, and an overall unique design.” He believes that minimalism popularity was driven by influencer trends but now people are “looking for ways to express their individualism and creativity.”</p>\n<p>One way to embrace maximalism and still have your room look organized is to pick just a few colors to use for emphasis. Repeat these colors throughout your space to create cohesion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5mixandmatchkitchens\">5. Mix-and-Match Kitchens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/mixed-metal-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"A kitchen with stainless steel appliances and gold metal light fixtures\" /></p>\n<p>This kitchen mixes stainless steel appliances with gold light fixtures.</p>\n<p>Adam Graham of {{< external-link url=\"http://fixr.com/\" text=\"Fixr.com\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/fixr<em>com/\" text=\"@fixr</em>com\" >}}) tells us, “There is a move away from installing only stainless steel, but instead having different metal appliances and finishes, such as a sunset bronze refrigerator for a cost of anywhere between $1,000 and $12,000, mixed with different finishes for sinks, faucets, cabinet hardware, and lighting fixtures.” This combined with new, vibrant color schemes on your walls gives your kitchen a complete, modern overhaul.</p>\n<p>However, much like with maximalism, you risk a sense of disorganization if you mix and match too much. Your better option is to pick a main finish and add one or two complementary ones as accents.You could try this by keeping your big-ticket appliances, like your refrigerator and stove, but switching out your cabinet hardware. That’s just one of <a href=\"/blog/easy-home-projects/\">several easy DIY projects</a> you can do when stuck at home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6vintage70slook\">6. Vintage 70s Look</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/retro-living-room.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with retro leather chairs, wood paneled floors, and colorful mod vases\" /></p>\n<p>Design elements from the 1970s are great in small doses.</p>\n<p>While you might not normally seek out an avocado green refrigerator, don’t rule out the color schemes and styles of the 1970s. Mark Cutler and Nichole Schulze of Cutler Schulze believe there are a lot of reasons the 70's are making a comeback.</p>\n<p>The biggest factor is “ongoing supply chain issues” that make it difficult for people to buy new. This has people “turning to local sources like vintage stores and swap meets to redecorate.” The vintage 70s look is a great way to add character to your home, mixing a bit of the old with a bit of the new (such as appliances).</p>\n<h2 id=\"7timelessdesignselements\">7. Timeless Designs Elements</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/timeless-design.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with a black wall, black couch, and bold pink, textured accent rug and throw pillow\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless design elements help make your home your own.</p>\n<p>Many of us are seeing less value in following the latest trends and more value in making a home reflect who we are. “Timeless design elements encompass statements of personal identity,” according to Amanda Eirich of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.bfr.com/\" text=\"Brook Furniture Rental\" >}} ({{< external-link url=\"https://www.instagram.com/bfr<em>brookfurniturerental/\" text=\"@bfr</em>brookfurniturerental\" >}}). “It's always appropriate to curate your home with the items that you are drawn to and love.”</p>\n<p>Eirich emphasizes that it’s okay to experiment until you find something you love. Play with lighting to improve your mood and freshen up a room. Look for centerpieces that mean something to you, like a dining room table that invites people to sit and talk. It’s all about finding pieces that speak to you that won’t lose their appeal when the next trend comes around.</p>"

      title: "8 Types of Plumbing Pipes You Find in Homes"
      body: "<p>Plumbing is probably something you only think about when something goes wrong, but it’s actually one of the most important systems in your home. In fact, it’s so important that the types of plumbing pipes you choose can have a dramatic impact on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s right, the type of plumbing pipes in your home could actually mean some insurance companies won’t offer you a homeowners policy. Here’s what you need to know about the plumbing pipes that you find in your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1pex\">1. PEX</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-if-pipes-pex.jpg\" alt=\"PEX pipes attached to the basement ceiling of a home, angled view\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Flexible PEX pipe can weave throughout walls, ceilings, and crawl spaces.</small></i><p></p>\n<p>PEX is a type of plumbing pipe that is made of cross-linked polyethylene. This material makes it strong enough to handle water pressure while also being flexible so installation is easy. You can even form 90-degree curves with it. Unfortunately, it’s not part of building codes in all U.S. cities and counties, so you should check with a building inspector prior to installing PEX.</p>\n<p>Where it is allowed, PEX costs up to $2 per foot, making it a cost-effective solution to replace copper or galvanized steel. Some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> may hesitate to offer coverage to a home with PEX plumbing, particularly where the building codes do not allow it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2pvc\">2. PVC</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-pvc.jpg\" alt=\"Image shows a plumber's hands installing white PVC pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>PVC pipe is inexpensive and easy to use but should be installed by professionals.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes are used as drain or vent lines. Builders like it because it’s lighter and less cumbersome than working with steel or copper, but homeowners like it for the price. PVC pipes cost about $1 per foot, and a small home with five to 10 fixtures typically costs about $1,800 to fit. Joints are glued together which makes a well-installed system a good option; however,</p>\n<p>Like PEX, PVC is not approved for home use in all states. You’ll want to check with a contractor to determine the viability of using it in your home. Plus, installing PVC pipe is probably not a DIY-kind of job because poor installation can lead to leaks in critical areas. Most insurance companies don’t have an issue with PVC pipes, but it’s important to have a professional install them or you may have frequent leaks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3copper\">3. Copper</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-copper.jpg\" alt=\"A closeup of thin copper pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Copper pipes are high quality, but their rigidity can make them difficult to work with.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Copper is the most expensive type of plumbing pipe available. It costs at least $4 per foot, and repiping a home with copper can cost up to $20,000. But many homeowners prefer copper pipes because they don’t come with the health concerns that some other pipes may have ﹘ an important quality for water intake lines.</p>\n<p>Plumbers also like the quality of copper pipe but concede that it is difficult to work with. Because it is so rigid, working it throughout a house can be problematic. You have to cut copper pipes with a hacksaw or specialized copper tube cutter, and then solder the joints together. This requires experienced tradespeople. However, insurance companies almost always have a preference for copper because it lasts long and traditionally has fewer risks for leaks when installed properly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4abs\">4. ABS</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-abs.jpg\" alt=\"Stacks of black ABS pipes\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Like PVC, ABS pipes may not be allowed in your town.</small><i></p></p>\n<p>Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe has a lot of similarities to PVC pipe. They look alike, both used as drain and vent pipes, and cost just about the same. And as with PVC and PEX pipes, ABS is a type of plumbing pipe that is not permitted in all cities and counties, so you need to check local building codes before installing it.</p>\n<p>That said, ABS is black and slightly softer than PVC pipe. It's also stronger and handles cold temperatures well ﹘ although it can warp in higher temps. More importantly, ABS pipes are hardened using bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical that may cause negative side effects on fetuses, infants, children, and animals. Insurance companies typically insure homes with ABS pipes where the pipes are included in building codes. However, some may be concerned about the possibility of leaks forming in certain climates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5flexibleconnectors\">5. Flexible Connectors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-flex.jpg\" alt=\"Two silver flexible connectors on a white background\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Flexible connector pipes are usually small, connecting appliances to the water supply in a wall.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Flex connectors are used for linking appliances to the main intake lines throughout your house. For example, you can usually find them connecting your ice maker, dishwasher, or water heater to the main kitchen line.</p>\n<p>Flex pipes cost more than other types of plumbing pipes, but they’re useful, even necessary, in small areas that require a pipe of an unusual shape. Homeowners can get frustrated with flex pipes as they are thin and prone to cracking, which also means they should be checked periodically. Using flexible connections most likely won’t hurt your home insurance rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6galvanizedsteelandcastironpipes\">6. Galvanized Steel and Cast Iron Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-galvanized-steel.jpg\" alt=\"A bundle of galvanized steel pipes in a warehouse yard\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Galvanized steel pipe sometimes carries gas, but it should never be used for water supply.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>You may see galvanized steel pipe in older homes, but it’s much less common now. It fell out of favor because the zinc coating and pipe can corrode, resulting in a build up of lead that may end up in your water. Moreover, galvanized steel pipes connect by screwing threaded ends together or into connecting fittings. This makes the pipes difficult to install.</p>\n<p>Cast iron pipes are more common than galvanized steel and are often used for sewer and drainage purposes. Like galvanized steel, cast iron pipes are difficult to install, but in this case, that’s because the pipes are heavy and hard to cut. Cast iron also rusts, which can lead to significant leaking problems if not properly maintained. Insurance companies may insure a home with galvanized steel or cast iron pipes, but the risk they pose for water damage could mean a higher premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7leadpipes\">7. Lead Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-lead.jpg\" alt=\"Red water valve on an old lead pipe\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Lead pipe, while uncommon, may still be in homes built before 1986.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Homes built prior to 1986 may have lead pipes that have not been replaced. That’s a big problem because lead plumbing systems can cause serious health problems. In fact, the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all new plumbing materials be lead-free. If your home still has lead plumbing, insurance companies, including Kin, are unlikely going to offer you a policy until your plumbing is replaced with safer materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8polybutylenepipes\">8. Polybutylene Pipes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/type-of-pipe-polybutylene.jpg\" alt=\"Man manual cuts off a piece of pplastic pipe for installation water line\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Polybutylene pipes tend to fail, so most home insurance companies won’t insure them.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Polybutylene pipes are made from a type of plastic resin and were commonly installed in homes from 1978 through 1995. They are no longer used because the disinfectants used to clean public water supplies cause microfractures in polybutylene. As a result, polybutylene pipes have a tendency to become brittle and fail, which can lead to extensive damage costing thousands in repairs.</p>\n<p>Like most insurance companies, we won’t offer homeowners policies if your home still has polybutylene pipes. During your <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>, you want to look for polybutylene pipes. They’re typically gray or white and have a dull finish rather than a shiny one.</p>"

      title: "9 Home Insurance Mistakes You Can Totally Avoid"
      body: "<p>Homeowners insurance has a reputation for being complex. And historically, it has been. Usually it's full of legalese that's incredibly hard to parse. It's little wonder so many folks are in the dark about what their insurance actually covers.</p>\n<p>In fact, a {{< external-link url=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-insurance-protect-against-extreme-164904980.html\" text=\"recent study from Realtor.com\" >}} found that only 56 percent of homeowners know what to look for when buying a policy. Ouch.</p>\n<p>But that's where we can help. Let's recap the nine most common homeowners insurance mistakes so you can better understand your coverage and avoid confusion when it's time to file a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake1assumingfloodsarecovered\">Mistake #1: Assuming Floods Are Covered</h2>\n<p>Home insurance typically covers water damage related to something like a burst pipe, but it seldom pays claims for water coming into your house from an external source. This means storm surge during a hurricane is usually excluded, as is water damage from flash flooding, broken levies, and broken sump pumps.</p>\n<p>Long story short, <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">most people need flood insurance</a>. You can usually add our <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance endorsement</a> to your policy for as little as $175 per year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake2failingtocompareoffers\">Mistake #2: Failing to Compare Offers</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance premiums can fluctuate from company to company. In fact, one insurance company may be too expensive one year, but affordable the next, so you want to compare rates when you shop for coverage.</p>\n<p>As you shop, make sure you compare apples to apples. Price is important, but you only know if you’re getting a deal if you also check the coverage amounts and <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> or add-ons. Otherwise, you may pick the lowest premium only to find out that you’re one of the <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">64 percent of homeowners who are underinsured</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake3insuringyourhomeformarketvaluenotreplacementvalue\">Mistake #3: Insuring Your Home for Market Value, Not Replacement Value</h2>\n<p>Confusing your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">fair market value and its replacement cost</a> is one of the most common homeowners insurance mistakes. The limits on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> should be the amount it would take to rebuild your home, not what someone would pay to buy it. A home’s market value can be higher or lower than its replacement cost, so it’s not an accurate reflection of what your insurance company needs to make you whole after a loss.</p>\n<p>Your insurance representative can explain how your insurer calculates dwelling value. Most companies use a similar formula that looks at your home’s square footage, building materials, and other features as well as the construction costs based on your location. Understanding this calculation can help insure your home for the proper value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake4choosingtoohighofadeductible\">Mistake #4: Choosing Too High of a Deductible</h2>\n<p>You can save money on your home insurance if you choose a higher <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. This increases your responsibility in a claim, and that ultimately saves the insurance company money. However, you want to be cautious if you go this route. Raising your deductible reduces your premium, but you also have to come up with that amount if you have a claim.</p>\n<p>Before committing to a deductible, do the math on how much savings you’re really getting. At some point, the savings may not be worth it if you don’t have an emergency fund to pay for losses. One tip people use is to take the savings from a higher deductible and put that into an emergency fund to build that nest egg. But you have to be disciplined to do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake5notgettingsewerbackupcoverage\">Mistake #5: Not Getting Sewer Backup Coverage</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies automatically exclude losses resulting from a sewer backup. That’s right! Damage to your newly-renovated bathroom may not be covered if a flood causes sewer water to back up into your home. Luckily, most insurance companies offer an endorsement that covers this event for as little as $40 per year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake6underestimatingthevalueofpersonalbelongings\">Mistake #6: Underestimating the Value of Personal Belongings</h2>\n<p>People often grossly underestimate the value of the contents of their home; some even do it on purpose in hopes of saving on their insurance. But think about that might cost you in a total loss. When you add up the value of everything inside your home, from electronics to appliances, clothing, and home goods, you could be looking at more than $100,000 in stuff.</p>\n<p>One way to get a better handle on what your personal belongings are worth is to conduct a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a>. Use a <a href=\"/images/checklist/personal-property-inventory-checklist.pdf\">checklist</a> to properly record and categorize your stuff, and then store a copy away from your home so you can access it if there’s a catastrophe. You’ll be glad you have a complete list of lost items that includes serial numbers and receipts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake7keepingtheminimumliabilitycoverage\">Mistake #7: Keeping the Minimum Liability Coverage</h2>\n<p>The default <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">limit for liability coverage</a> in a homeowners insurance policy is usually $100,000, and that may be enough for some people. But others, like homeowners with an attractive nuisance or who host large parties, may have a greater risk of being sued and might want to consider increasing their liability coverage.</p>\n<p>There is no requirement or law that says how much coverage you need; it’s up to you to determine what’s appropriate for you. More importantly, increasing your liability coverage won’t dramatically increase your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake8forgettingtonotifyyourinsurerofmajorchanges\">Mistake #8: Forgetting to Notify Your Insurer of Major Changes</h2>\n<p>Certain changes in your home life merit a call to your insurance representative because they impact your coverage. For example, let your insurer know if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get married or ask someone to move in.</li>\n<li>Get a dog on a <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breed list</a>.</li>\n<li>Remodel your kitchen.</li>\n<li>Add a second bedroom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes like these can mean you need additional coverage, and if you don’t notify your insurance carrier you risk having a claim denied because the new detail wasn’t part of the original coverage. Don’t feel like you’re burdening your insurance agent with phone calls. They need to know and appreciate the heads up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mistake9thinkinghomeinsurancecoversmaintenanceissues\">Mistake #9: Thinking Home Insurance Covers Maintenance Issues</h2>\n<p>As a homeowner, you’re responsible for maintaining your home. That includes issues that might cause damage if you ignore them. like <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">getting a new roof</a> when necessary or <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">dealing with pests</a>. If you don’t take care of these kinds of problems, your insurance may deny a claim for any resulting damages.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say the railing on your staircase has rotted, and gives away when your neighbor grabs it. While your homeowners insurance usually covers a visitor’s injuries, it would most likely deny this claim because you failed to take care of the railing.</p>\n<p>Once you know the basics, getting homeowners insurance is pretty easy. All you have to do is answer a few simple questions and you can have your policy in just minutes. But if you still have questions, our representatives are also ready to help.</p>"

      body: "<p>Replacing your windows goes a long way towards giving your home a fresh, new look. New windows can usually improve your home’s energy efficiency, increase safety for people with children and pets, and possibly even help with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> (check with your insurer).</p>\n<p>But the different types of windows have advantages and disadvantages to consider. We took a look at several window types and styles to help you figure out what makes sense for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1singlehungwindows\">1. Single-hung windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/single-hung-window.jpg\" alt=\"Single white window on teal house with window box full of flowers\" /></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever seen a child’s drawing of a home, then chances are you have an idea of what single-hung windows are. They’re the type of window that opens by raising the bottom panel, and they’re the most common windows on the market.</p>\n<p>Single-hung windows have fewer features than double-hung windows, so they cost less. They’re also easier to replace because they’re so common. However, you can only lift the bottom sash, and that limits the amount of ventilation they provide. The outside of single-hung windows can be difficult to clean, and slipping can become a problem over time.</p>\n<p>Cost: $250 to $600 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Difficult to clean exterior |\n| Easy to replace | Slipping can be a problem |\n|  | Limited ventilation |</p>\n<h2 id=\"2doublehungwindows\">2. Double-hung windows</h2>\n<p>Double-hung windows look a lot like their single-hung friends, but these windows open from both the top and bottom sashes. This makes them great for ventilation. Most also tilt, which makes cleaning them very easy.</p>\n<p>That extra feature, however, ends up increasing the price. And slipping can still be a problem if these windows are not properly maintained. That said, double-hung windows are a great space saver because they don’t protrude from the wall.</p>\n<p>Cost: $300 - $700</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Easy to clean | Difficult to clean exterior |\n| Great for ventilation | Slipping can be a problem |\n| Good for saving space | More expensive than single-hung |</p>\n<h2 id=\"3casementorcrankwindows\">3. Casement or crank windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/casement-window.jpg\" alt=\"Casement windows in a modern loft apartment\" /></p>\n<p>Casement windows sit on a hinge so you open them by turning a crank that swings the window out. This is easy to do and creates a good deal of airflow when opened. However, what’s easy for you to open may also be easy for a burglar. Moreover, the mechanical parts are subject to more wear and tear than some other types of windows.</p>\n<p>Cost: $300 to $750 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Great for ventilation | Easy to break in to |\n| Easy to open and close | Prone to wear and tear |\n| Weathertight seal | Expensive |</p>\n<h2 id=\"4picturewindows\">4. Picture windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/picture-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of modern home with picture window\" /></p>\n<p>Picture windows frame a view that you want to capture from inside your home. They let in a lot of light and can make the interior feel connected to the outside, all of which can make a great impression. However, picture windows are sealed in place, so they don’t help with ventilation, and they may also allow heat to escape even with their weathertight seals.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $400 to $800 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Unobstructed views | No ventilation |\n| Increased natural light | Not energy efficient |\n| Weathertight seal | Difficult to clean |</p>\n<h2 id=\"5slidingwindows\">5. Sliding windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/sliding-window.jpg\" alt=\"White wall with an open sliding window\" /></p>\n<p>Also called gliding windows or sliders, sliding windows are a lot like a double-hung window laid on its side. This makes sliding windows ideal for long, horizontal spaces. Even better, a tilting slicing window can also be easier to clean than other types of windows. They don’t require a crank so they’re more durable than casement windows, and they generally have better seals than double-hung windows. However, sliding windows are seldom available in wood, and people often complain about sticky sliders.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $400 to $900 per window</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Low maintenance |\n| Some are easy to clean | Prone to sticking |\n| Energy efficient | Limited materials |</p>\n<h2 id=\"6awningwindows\">6. Awning windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/awning-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of a gray house with a close-up of an open, white awning window\" /></p>\n<p>An awning window is similar to a casement window except its hinges are at the top of the frame. When you turn the crank, the window frame swings open from the bottom. This makes awning windows good for security, but that narrow opening makes exiting in an emergency difficult. Additionally, cleaning the exterior isn’t easy, and the mechanical components can break.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $350 to $900 to install.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Inexpensive | Prone to wear and tear |\n| Good for security | Difficult to clean |\n| Easy to open | Can be damaged if left open |</p>\n<h2 id=\"7baywindows\">7. Bay windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/bay-window.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of a red brick house with a white bay window\" /></p>\n<p>Bay windows usually consist of a series of flat windows that project from the side of your home and allow plenty of natural light to enter from multiple angles. The windows are grouped in a way that creates a shelf inside your home while also improving curb appeal.</p>\n<p>The amount of light they let in means bay windows probably aren’t the right choice for bedrooms, plus it can be hard to find window treatments for them. Moreover, bay windows don’t open and close, though some homeowners will use casement or double-hung windows on the side panels to improve airflow. Even without this addition, bay windows require professional installation, and that increases the cost.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $1,200 t0 $3,500</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Allow lots of natural light in | Expensive |\n| Increases interior square footage | Difficult to install |\n| Boosts curb appeal | Difficult to find window treatments |</p>\n<h2 id=\"8skylights\">8. Skylights</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/skylight-window.jpg\" alt=\"A white framed skylight looking out towards blue skies and a flowering tree\" /></p>\n<p>Skylights are windows that are installed into the roof to allow a maximum amount of natural light into a room. They’re particularly useful for lighting up a dark, interior room. You can choose skylights that are fixed, or one that’s vented that you can open to allow in fresh air. Placed in the right position, skylights can actually help keep your house warm.</p>\n<p>Skylights, however, are not cheap. They should be professionally installed, and you have to take good care of them. Leaky skylights can cause damage to your roof.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $900 to $2,150 per skylight.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Allows lots of natural light | Expensive |\n| Provides indirect solar heat | May result in leaks and roof damage |\n| Can help with ventilation | Difficult to clean inside and out |</p>\n<h2 id=\"9transomwindows\">9. Transom windows</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/transom-window.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional transom window with black ironwork\" /></p>\n<p>Transom windows that sit on top of interior and exterior doors and windows are mainly decorative elements, but they also let in additional natural light. Today, most transom windows don’t open and close, which means they can make rooms stuffy from radiant heat. The ones that do open allow air to flow through the home without opening all the doors and windows.</p>\n<p>Depending on the size and type, transom windows can be difficult to maintain and clean. Prices can also vary.</p>\n<p>Cost estimate: $200 to $600 per installed window.</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Increases sunlight | Most limit airflow |\n| Inexpensive | May increase heat |\n| Stylish | Difficult to clean |</p>\n<p>One final note: Depending on where you live (We’re looking at you, South Florida!) you may need <a href=\"/blog/impact-resistant-windows/\">impact-resistant windows</a> and <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a>.

      title: "Aging in place: Remodeling tips for seniors"
      body: "<p>After all the effort we put towards turning our houses into homes, it’s little wonder that most of us hope to stay in our homes for as long as we can. But the physical changes that come with growing older can create safety concerns for seniors hoping to age in place.</p>\n<p>The solution? Aging in place remodeling. With a little planning, you can modify your home so it’s safer for you as you age.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisaginginplace\">What is aging in place?</h2>\n<p>Data shows that {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aarp.org/home-family/your-home/info-2021/home-and-community-preferences-survey.html\" text=\"77% of adults\" >}} over the age of 50 want to age in place, meaning they want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. That number has stayed more or less the same for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of good reasons someone might choose to age in place, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comfort.</strong> We all feel better being around things we are familiar with, and aging seniors often like the familiarity and memories that their homes provide.</li>\n<li><strong>Independence.</strong> Being able to contribute to society and maintaining a sense of autonomy can go a long way to preventing depression.</li>\n<li><strong>Pets.</strong> Sometimes assisted living facilities prohibit certain types of animals. Keeping your beloved pets helps you get exercise while also providing companionship.</li>\n<li><strong>Community.</strong> The relationships you’ve built with your neighbors are important to staying active and healthy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all of the benefits, staying in your home for the long term does have risks. People often develop mobility and balance issues as they age. These plus poor hearing and eyesight can make it difficult for older adults to age in place.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s important to think about the accommodations you might need and to start remodeling now. Doing what you can now may increase the likelihood of you staying in your home as you age.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aginginplaceremodelingtips\">Aging in place remodeling tips</h2>\n<p>While aging in place is a priority for many older adults, understanding what that entails may not be on everyone’s radar. Only {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/community/info-2021/2021-home-community-preferences.html\" text=\"34% of older adults\" >}} realize they’ll need to make physical changes to their homes in order to remain in it as they age.</p>\n<p>Most homes require some modifications to make them safe for seniors. Here’s our list of aging in place remodeling tips to get you started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installsmarttechnologydevices\">Install smart technology devices</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-smart-tech.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Installing smart technology may make it easier for seniors to age in place.</em></p>\n<p>Smart technology may be one of the simplest ways to make aging in place a reality. Installing it in your home now means you can likely use your smartphone or virtual assistant to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn on the lights.</li>\n<li>Lock your doors.</li>\n<li>Raise and lower the temperature.</li>\n<li>Control appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even find <a href=\"/blog/smart-bathroom-technology/\">smart technology for your bathroom</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"makeyourbathroomsmoreaccessible\">Make your bathrooms more accessible</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-accessible-bathroom.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Zero-entry showers, handrails, and shower seats can minimize falls.</em></p>\n<p>Falls are a big concern for seniors, so many of our remodeling tips focus on minimizing your chances of falling. For example, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Convert your bathtub into a walk-in shower.</strong> This eliminates that first awkward step into a tub where you could easily lose your balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Add handrails or a grab bar.</strong> That way you have something to hold on if you do get wobbly.</li>\n<li><strong>Opt for a permanent shower seat.</strong> This can reduce your fall chances even further.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another area of concern in the bathroom is the floor. While no flooring is completely slip resistant, some do provide better protection from falls. Vinyl, natural stone, cork, and bamboo are all options to consider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"updateyourcountertops\">Update your countertops</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-rounded-counters.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Rounded countertops may reduce injuries for seniors aging in place.</em></p>\n<p>You may want to install kitchen and bathroom countertops with rounded corners if you plan on aging at home. Not only can an older person hit their head on a sharp corner in a fall, but they may suffer bruising if they bump into one. Another option might be to use a corner guard to soften edges.</p>\n<p>While you’re thinking about countertops, you might also want to consider getting some with multiple levels. A standard 36-inch counter could make up the majority of your workspace, but adding shorter levels would give you an option for sitting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thinkaboutmobilityaids\">Think about mobility aids</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-pull-out-shelf.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Pull-out shelves minimize can be a big help for seniors with limited mobility.</em></p>\n<p>As it gets harder to move about, many of us will end up using mobility aids, such as wheelchairs and walkers. Installing a ramp is the first step to making the home more accessible. Even if you don’t need a wheelchair, a ramp can be easier than climbing porch stairs.</p>\n<p>But there are likely other areas of your home that could use similar treatment. For example, take a look at your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bathroom.</strong> A roll-in shower eliminates the curb at your shower entrance, making it easier for someone in a wheelchair to get in.</li>\n<li><strong>Doorways</strong>. Door openings need to be at least 32 inches to give a wheelchair sufficient room. (Check the space allotted in your garage, too. You typically need five feet of space to get wheelchairs and other assistive devices out of cars.)</li>\n<li><strong>Cabinets.</strong> Pull-out shelves in lower cabinets and pull-down shelves in upper cabinets can make it easier for people with limited mobility to find what they need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"addachairlift\">Add a chair lift</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-chair-lift.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Chair lifts give seniors access to upper levels in their homes.</em></p>\n<p>Older people who live in multi-story buildings often put everything they need on the main floor of their home. That way, they minimize the amount of time they spend using the stairs and reduce their fall risk.</p>\n<p>However, that’s not possible in every home so another option is a chair lift. This gives you access to the upper levels of your home, while also protecting you from falls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjustlightswitchesandoutlets\">Adjust light switches and outlets</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aging-in-place-electrical-outlet.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>Moving outlets can make them more accessible for seniors.</em></p>\n<p>You can hire an electrician to move light switches and outlets to a height that works for you. That may mean lowering switches so you can easily reach them from a seated position or raising electrical outlets so you don’t have to bend over to plug something in. Another good idea is to put electrical outlets on countertops or in backsplashes.</p>\n<p>One final tip: be sure to check your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> whenever you remodel. The changes you make may increase the value of your house, so you want to check that you have enough coverage when it’s time to renew.</p>"

      title: "Are FEMA Flood Maps Accurate? "
      body: "<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed flood maps to help communities better understand the risk of flooding in their communities. For decades, FEMA flood maps were the basis for flood regulations, building standards, and, until recently, National Flood Insurance Programs (NFIP) flood insurance rates.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s recently implemented Risk Rating 2.0 to update its methodology for pricing NFIP policies and deliver rates that actually reflect a property’s true risk. While its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-map-zone\" text=\"are no longer the most significant factor in rating premiums\" >}}, they are still used to determine which properties must have flood insurance.</p>\n<p>And that can be a real problem. FEMA’s maps are outdated and don’t reflect the <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">impact of climate change</a>, which is making more and more homes vulnerable to flooding. That could create a false sense of security for homeowners outside of FEMA-designated high-risk flood areas that aren’t required to have flood insurance.</p>\n<p>In other words: it may be part of the reason so many homeowners are utterly <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-flood/\">unprepared for a flood</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femafloodmapsfailtoreflectclimatechange\">FEMA Flood Maps Fail to Reflect Climate Change</h2>\n<p>FEMA flood maps are supposed to show how likely an area is to flood. Areas that FEMA predicts to have more than a one-percent chance of flooding in a year are considered high-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>. These areas typically have flood insurance purchase requirements as well as building regulations to minimize damage.</p>\n<p>FEMA bases its predictions and designations partly on historical data. That would be perfectly fine except it doesn’t reflect the impact of climate change, which means it doesn’t account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher water levels.</li>\n<li>More intense precipitation.</li>\n<li>More frequent hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The New York Times {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/29/climate/hidden-flood-risk-maps.html\" text=\"reports\" >}} that new calculations from the First Street Foundation estimates that at least 14.6 million properties across the US are at risk for flooding, compared to the 8.7 million FEMA flood maps show.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of properties that may have more flood risk than anyone realizes. In Chicago alone, First Street’s data shows over 75,000 properties with flood risk that have gone unrecognized on FEMA flood maps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femafloodmapsareoftenoutdatedorincomplete\">FEMA Flood Maps Are Often Outdated or Incomplete</h2>\n<p>Originally, predicting the impact of climate change wasn’t an exact science, but {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/how-climate-models-got-so-accurate-they-earned-a-nobel-prize\" text=\"models are getting more accurate every year\" >}}. However, not accounting for climate change is only one of the problems with FEMA flood maps. The maps are also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Badly outdated.</strong> According to the National Resources Defense Council, two-thirds of FEMA flood maps {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/joel-scata/femas-outdated-and-backward-looking-flood-maps\" text=\"haven’t been updated in five years\" >}}, a cadence that’s required by federal law. Some haven’t been updated in more than 30 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Incomplete.</strong> Scientific American {{< external-link url=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/studies-sound-alarm-on-badly-out-of-date-fema-flood-maps/\" text=\"reports\" >}} that only one-third of streams and 46 percent of coasts have been mapped by FEMA. Moreover, when data for an area isn’t updated at the five-year mark, the flood risk is considered “unknown.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flood risk is constantly evolving, so flood maps need to be updated regularly to incorporate new flood information and risks. But the cost (between {{< external-link url=\"https://asfpm-library.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/FSC/MapNation/ASFPM<em>MaptheNation</em>Report<em>2020.pdf\" text=\"$3.2 billion and $11.8 billion\" >}} to finish mapping the US, according to the Association of State Floodplain Managers) and the fact that FEMA is responsible for approximately {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema</em>adoption-flood-insurance-rate-maps-participating-communities_bulletin.pdf\" text=\"22,000 communities’ maps\" >}} makes regular updates nearly impossible. This forces FEMA to focus on more populous areas with more risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimpactoffemafloodmapissues\">The Impact of FEMA Flood Map Issues</h2>\n<p>The outcome of having outdated and incomplete flood maps is that people don’t know the risks they face. As a result, they may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unknowingly move to areas with a high risk for flood.</li>\n<li>End up underinsured when a flood hits.</li>\n<li>Build homes that can’t withstand flooding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An unprepared community can also mismanage its resources. Take for example the record-breaking downpours in Tennessee in August 2021. Not only were {{< external-link url=\"https://www.air-worldwide.com/blog/posts/2021/9/tennessee-flooding-underscores-insurance/\" text=\"few homeowners covered by the NFIP\" >}}, but officials were unprepared for the floods that followed 17 inches of rain.</p>\n<p>The opposite can happen, too, as it did with Hurricane Ida. FEMA predicted a storm surge of up to nine feet in Houma, Louisiana. But because flood maps weren’t updated to account for the city’s 13-foot levee system, the city used valuable resources to guard against flooding that never happened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingbetterfloodmaps\">Building Better Flood Maps</h2>\n<p>Put simply, flood maps need to accurately reflect today’s risk. The first step is to include climate change data, much like First Street’s {{< external-link url=\"https://floodfactor.com/\" text=\"Flood Factor\" >}} does. It’s an interactive website where homeowners can enter their address to see what their risk is based on current and historical data that incorporates the location’s chance for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-intensity rainfall.</li>\n<li>Overflow from rivers and streams.</li>\n<li>Coastal storm surge.</li>\n<li>High tides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Association of State Floodplain Managers also recommends flood maps for all populated areas as well as those with potential for population growth. As flood maps are updated, they need to account for any measures taken to reduce flood risk, such as levees and dams.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s not an inexpensive undertaking to develop these maps. But catastrophic floods are even costlier. Plus, as the association notes, accurate flood maps keep people from building in risky areas so fewer homes suffer the direct cost of flood damage. Most importantly, accurate flood maps could help keep more people safe.</p>\n<p>Homeowners also need to know that there’s really no such thing as a flood-free zone. In fact, FEMA makes a regular point of noting that 25 percent of flood claims come from areas with low-to-moderate risk. And that means <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood insurance is for everyone</a>.</p>"

      title: "Atlantic hurricane season: 2021 outlook"
      body: "<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> The 2021 hurricane season officially ended on November 30, 2021. In total, there were 21 named storms, making 2021 the third most active year on record in terms of named storms and the sixth consecutive above-normal hurricane season.</p>\n<p>In 2021, hurricanes collectively caused more than $70 billion in damage in the United States, and more than 90% of it caused by Hurricane Ida. Ida reached top wind speeds of 150 mph when it made landfall in Louisiana. Then the storm system headed north to New York City, where it flooded city streets and subways. All told, the storm caused more than $60 billion damage and resulted in more than 90 deaths in the United States.</p>\n<p>Every year, the Atlantic hurricane season brings dangerous storms along the Atlantic coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. This year looks to be similar to last year where we had a record-breaking number of hurricanes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"predictionsforthe2021atlantichurricaneseason\">Predictions for the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season</h2>\n<p>As of August 4, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) experts predict an above-normal season for the Atlantic with {{< external-link url=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/atlantic-hurricane-season-shows-no-signs-of-slowing\" text=\"15 to 21 named storms\" >}} (i.e., winds of 39 mph or more) in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Of those named storms, seven to 10 could have winds of 74 mph or more, making them hurricanes. They also anticipate between three and five hurricanes to be Category 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>Colorado State University (CSU) researchers, on the other hand, recently {{< external-link url=\"https://engr.source.colostate.edu/csu-researchers-continue-to-predict-active-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season-2/\" text=\"reduced their predictions for the 2021 season\" >}}. However, their predictions still fall in line with NOAA’s predictions for an active Atlantic hurricane season for 2021 with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>18 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CSU team also reports on the probability of hurricanes making landfall. Where the full-season average for the last century is 52 percent, the chance for landfall for the 2021 season is 65 percent. For Florida’s Gulf coast, where the full-season average has been 30 percent, CSU puts the probability for landfall at 41 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atlantichurricaneseasonofftoabusystart\">Atlantic hurricane season off to a busy start</h2>\n<p>We were only about a month into the 2021 season when we saw our first hurricane. Elsa reached Category 1 status on July 2, which is six weeks earlier than the average date for the first hurricane. Moreover, Elsa was the earliest fifth-named storm ever recorded in the Atlantic waters.</p>\n<p>But Elsa was not the first named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Prior to it, we also had tropical storms Ana, Bill, Claudette, and Danny. Ana was classified as a tropical storm on May 22, ten days before hurricane season.</p>\n<p>But is this different from previous years? Last year, the Atlantic hurricane season set a record with 30 <a href=\"/blog/how-are-hurricanes-named/\">named storms</a>, 14 of which became hurricanes, including seven major ones. And while scientist aren’t predicting as much activity in the 2021 season, there are a few interesting facts to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both the 2020 and 2021 Atlantic hurricane seasons saw five named storms by the first week of July.</li>\n<li>This year is the seventh in a row where we had a named storm prior to the start of the hurricane season.</li>\n<li>We’ve had five straight years of above-average hurricane seasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s probably too soon to call that a pattern. The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\" text=\"Center for Climate and Energy Solutions points out\" >}} that there’s no clear consensus on whether climate change will increase the frequency of hurricanes. But it also notes that climate change creates conditions that lead to more intense hurricanes, which ultimately means people need to be ready for this new normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beingpreparedforhurricaneseason\">Being prepared for hurricane season</h2>\n<p>If you live in an area where hurricanes are likely, then you need a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">hurricane preparedness plan</a> that covers both sheltering in place and evacuating your home. Planning for both scenarios is important because you don’t know what your real risk is until shortly before a hurricane hits.</p>\n<p>You also want to check if you have sufficient <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Your policy most likely covers wind damage from a hurricane, but storm surge and flooding are another story. This type of loss is only covered by specialized <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policies.</p>\n<p>Anyone looking for home insurance during the Atlantic hurricane seasons – June 1 through November 30 –&nbsp;should also work quickly to secure coverage. Insurance companies generally place <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-moratorium/\">moratoriums</a> on writing new policies when a storm is on the way, which can delay getting your policy bound.</p>\n<p>Questions about your hurricane coverage?

      title: "Beginner’s guide to granny flats"
      body: "<p>Granny flats are becoming more popular for families all across the country – and for good reason! Not only can a granny flat help aging loved ones maintain a sense of independence, but they can also offset the high cost of buying a home.</p>\n<p>But adding a granny flat isn’t a <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">simple DIY home project</a>. Let’s dig into what granny flats are and what you need to know before you decide if it’s the best option for your household.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagrannyflat\">What is a granny flat?</h2>\n<p>First thing’s first: a granny flat is a small space, typically designed for just one or two people to live in. This may be a studio apartment or small one-bedroom structure, and it may be part of your primary residence or a separate building altogether.</p>\n<p>We’re calling this kind of space a granny flat, but the more official name is “accessory dwelling unit” (ADU). You might also have heard granny flats referred to as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mother-in-law cottages.</li>\n<li>Granny pods.</li>\n<li>In-law suites.</li>\n<li>Coach houses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the name suggests, a granny flat is typically built for elderly family members so they can live on the same property as their adult children and grandchildren. However, many homeowners use these spaces for adult children or domestic employees. Some even rent them out, but that depends on local laws – more on that later.</p>\n<p>Granny flats are often designed as self-contained areas, so they include most of the amenities you’d expect in a full-sized home, like a kitchen and a bathroom, only smaller. But you may see in-law suites that are actually apartments within a home. These types of granny flats usually have separate entrances from the rest of the house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethebenefitsofgrannyflats\">What are the benefits of granny flats?</h2>\n<p>Building a granny flat has a lot of benefits for homeowners. The first, and probably the most obvious is that an ADU can mean extra living space for the family. That, and the security of knowing your older family members are close by, can be enough of a reason to build a granny flat.</p>\n<p>But there are some monetary benefits, too. One study found that ADUs can add as much as {{< external-link url=\"https://www.appraisalinstitute.org/accessory-dwelling-units-may-have-higher-values-when-using-income-approach-the-appraisal-journal/\" text=\"34% to your assessed property value\" >}}. Another potential bonus is rental income. Many homeowners use their granny flat to offset their mortgage payment by using them as long-term and short-term rentals.</p>\n<p>If you want to use your ADU for extra income, then you really want to take a close look at home insurance. Most homeowners policies don’t cover short-term rentals. (Learn why in our article <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">Does Home Insurance Cover Airbnb?</a>) For long-term rentals, you may need to get a <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5thingstoconsiderbeforeaddingagrannyflattoyourproperty\">5 things to consider before adding a granny flat to your property</h2>\n<p>While you may see plenty of advantages to having a granny flat, you want to think carefully before you add one to your property. Here are five things to consider before building a granny flat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost\">Cost</h3>\n<p>There’s no way around it: adding a granny flat isn't cheap. How much one costs depends on any number of factors, but the most important one is probably the type. Building any structure from the ground up can be costly, but this one needs to be a livable space. That means it needs plumbing, gas, and electrical added to make it a liveable space. But don’t forget to factor in the cost of construction and permits, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zoning\">Zoning</h3>\n<p>Check your local building codes to make sure ADUs are allowed in your area. Many places may allow single-family dwelling properties to add granny flats, but not all do. You certainly don’t want to spend the time and money building something that is against zoning laws!</p>\n<p>While you're at it, you might want to check with your homeowners association (HOA) rules.Some may forbid you from adding an ADU.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insurance\">Insurance</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> will likely be affected if you build a granny flat. Generally, a stand-alone ADU built on the grounds of a single-family home is typically covered as an other structure under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>. However, a granny flat that is freestanding and has a separate postal address, while uncommon, usually needs its own policy where it could be covered by <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>.</p>\n<p>The other option is remodeling your home to add a granny flat. If you create an in-law suite in your primary residence, then it’s most likely covered by the dwelling portion of your home insurance policy. Either way, you may want to talk to your insurer to make sure you have sufficient coverage.</p>\n<p>One more caveat: a granny flat that you use to generate income to others typically requires a different type of insurance and may not be covered by your homeowners policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"size\">Size</h3>\n<p>Size impacts costs, but it can also determine whether or not you can legally build a granny flat. Some states have laws restricting how big your granny flat can be. California, for example, only lets you build an ADU that’s {{< external-link url=\"https://edringtonandassociates.com/adus/accessory-dwelling-units-frequently-asked-questions/\" text=\"1200 square feet or less\" >}}, assuming there are no local laws that limit size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"permits\">Permits</h3>\n<p>You’ll likely need permits to build a granny flat. Your contractor should be able to help you pull the right ones. Don’t start work until you have the permits in hand or you risk having construction shut down.</p>\n<p>Despite these factors, adding a granny flat (ADU, carriage house, or whatever you like to call it) is definitely achievable. All it takes is a little imagination and a lot of planning, but in the end you could have a beautiful space for your family to stay.</p>"

      title: "Beginner’s guide to sustainable gardening"
      body: "<p>Gardening may be one of the healthiest hobbies a homeowner can pick up. Not only does gardening get you outside in the sunshine and fresh air, but it can boost your mood and give you a dose of exercise to boot!</p>\n<p>But for all of these pluses, gardening can hurt the environment. That’s why more people are looking for sustainable gardening practices that let them reap the benefits while still protecting the earth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatissustainablegardening\">What is sustainable gardening?</h2>\n<p>Sustainable gardening is a set of practices where you grow plants, fruits, and vegetables while avoiding actions that can damage the environment. This might mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding pesticides.</li>\n<li>Selecting a variety of native plants, or plants that occur naturally in your area.</li>\n<li>Encouraging pollinators, like birds, butterflies and bees.</li>\n<li>Conserving water.</li>\n<li>Composting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to be a good steward of the earth and all of its flora and fauna.</p>\n<p>With Earth Day just around the corner, the time is ripe to start your first sustainable garden. Here are some steps to get your garden blooming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1choosetherightsite\">1. Choose the right site</h2>\n<p>Picking a location is the first step no matter what kind of gardening you plan to do. If you’re looking to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden/\">start a vegetable garden</a>, then you want to find a level spot that has six to eight hours of direct sunlight. Level ground is preferable for flower gardens, too. However, some flowers grow better in partial shade. Either way, you also want to avoid areas near a tree’s root system. The tree’s roots may compete with your garden for water and nutrients.</p>\n<p>If your yard is small, or you don’t have a yard at all, you could opt for a container garden and still practice sustainable gardening. Select pots or small plant boxes that are durable or made out of renewable materials, such as clay or bamboo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2knowandtestyoursoil\">2. Know (and test!) your soil</h2>\n<p>Soil is where your plants get their nutrients, so it’s clearly an important part of your garden. However, many new gardeners don’t realize there’s more than one kind of soil, and for sustainable gardening, you have to match what you have with what you plant. Some common types of soil include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loam.</strong> Loam is equal parts sand, clay, and silt so it drains well and is good for most plants.</li>\n<li><strong>Sandy.</strong> When soil has a lot of sand, it becomes dry and not very nutritious, but you may be able to use it with root vegetable or flower bulbs if you add in organic fertilizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Chalky.</strong> You might not know if your soil is chalky by looking at it, but it will bubble when you pour white vinegar on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Peat.</strong> Peat contains decomposed organic matter and feels sort of spongy. The acid in it can make it less nutritious.</li>\n<li><strong>Clay.</strong> Clay soil is often wet and sticky. Certain types of shrubs can grow in clay soil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another important detail about soil? Many types of flowers and vegetables grow best in soil that’s somewhat acidic. You can usually get your soil tested for free at your county’s extension services office or a nearby university. Once you have your results, you can follow the recommendations to help avoid over fertilizing your garden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3picknativeplants\">3. Pick native plants</h2>\n<p>Most gardeners have a favorite flower or vegetable, but selecting plants that grow naturally in your area is a better way to go. This helps ensure that your plants thrive without needing additional watering or fertilizers that may have a negative effect on the environment. The goal is to make your garden approximately 70 percent native plants.</p>\n<p>Take some time to explore your options at a <a href=\"/blog/home-and-garden-curb-appeal/\">home and garden show</a> or ask the experts at your local garden center. While you’re at it, try to take home several varieties. The more diverse your sustainable garden is, the more pollinators it will attract.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4conservewater\">4. Conserve water</h2>\n<p>Watering a garden can be tricky. Too little water and your flowers wilt, but too much can flood roots and cause rot. And from a sustainable gardening point of view, overwatering is just wasteful. Many sustainable gardeners choose drip irrigation systems because it saves water while making sure that the soil stays nice and moist all the time without watering the leaves.</p>\n<p>You can also conserve water by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gathering rainwater in barrels or buckets.</li>\n<li>Allowing swales to collect and redistribute rainwater.</li>\n<li>Adding mulch beds to retain moisture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number one rule for conserving water, however, is to only water your garden when you need to. Check the soil with your fingers, and skip watering when it’s moist.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5feedyourgardenorganically\">5. Feed your garden organically</h2>\n<p>Over fertilizing is a no-no for sustainable gardening, but that doesn’t mean you can’t ever fertilize your garden. Organic fertilizer can be part of the process, especially if your soil needs it or you have plants that require a lot of nutrients, like sunflowers and broccoli. Moreover, your plants may need food more frequently in the middle of their growing season. If plants start to look weak, it might be time to fertilize them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6startcomposting\">6. Start composting</h2>\n<p>Composting is a great way to feed and improve your garden’s soil while reducing the amount of waste you and your family produce. The most basic steps to creating a compost pile are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a pile of both brown (e.g. fallen leaves, cardboard, newspaper) and green (manure, kitchen scraps) materials.</li>\n<li>Lightly watering that pile.</li>\n<li>Giving the pile oxygen over once per week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the size of your pile, the elements being broken down, and how often you turn it, this can take anywhere from two weeks to two years. You’ll know it’s ready when it has a rich brown color and the consistency and texture that you’d expect from soil. Sprinkle a six-inch layer of compost on your plants to give them the healthiest environment possible.</p>"

      title: "Best Home Insurance Deals and Hidden Gems"
      body: "<p>Did you know your home insurance policy could do this?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thingsyoudidntknowhomeinsurancecovers\">Things You Didn't Know Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>As we’ve mentioned before, going to your local homeowners insurance agent may not be your best bet if you’re looking for a deal on the cost of your coverage. But let’s take a look at some of the best deals the typical homeowner gets in their insurance policy, including little-known coverage types and special features you can ask about.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personalliabilitycoverage_away_fromhome\">Personal Liability Coverage <em>Away</em> from Home</h3>\n<p>Most people know that their homeowners insurance offers <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability protection</a> for damage they cause to other people and their property at their home. But many homeowners policies also offer a limited amount of protection when you’re away from your home.</p>\n<p>So if you’re at a charity ball in a museum and knock over one of the sculptures on display and the nonprofit or the museum sues you, your homeowners insurance may cover the legal costs. Whew!</p>\n<h3 id=\"medicalexpensescoverage\">Medical Expenses Coverage</h3>\n<p>If someone gets hurt on your property and needs medical attention, your homeowners insurance likely offers coverage for the cost of those bills (see: <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments insurance</a>). This is a hidden gem of homeowners insurance policies. Insurance companies offer it because it’s usually more cost effective to deal with injuries immediately than to let them go untreated and develop into more expensive conditions.</p>\n<p>In other words, your home insurance company would rather pay to send someone to the ER in an ambulance, which might be a couple thousand dollars, than pay for a three-week hospital stay the guest needs after ignoring the injury for a few days.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacementcostpropertycoverage\">Replacement Cost Property Coverage</h3>\n<p>When choosing which kind of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">property insurance</a> to include in your homeowners policy, the best deal is usually replacement cost coverage. If anything happens to your stuff, your insurance company can provide you with enough money to replace damaged items with new equivalents.</p>\n<p>So say your TV is 10 years old but was top of the line 10 years ago. If it’s destroyed in a covered property event, you’ll receive as much money as you need to buy a new top-of-the-line TV.</p>\n<p>The alternative is actual cash value coverage, and it’s usually not a great deal. Yes, it will save you some money on your premiums, but in the event of a claim, you’ll only get enough money to cover the current cash value of whatever items you own. So you’d have the funds to find a 10-year-old TV to put in your fixed-up living room.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slanderandlibelcoverage\">Slander and Libel Coverage</h3>\n<p>We’re not suggesting you go out and defame anyone here, but homeowners insurance policies may offer advertising injury protection as part of your personal liability coverage. This means that if someone sues you for slander or libel (making false claims in speech or writing), your homeowners insurance may help with the legal bill.</p>\n<p>That coverage typically includes payment for your defense and settlements (up to your policy limit).</p>\n<h3 id=\"safetydiscounts\">Safety Discounts</h3>\n<p>Making your home safer benefits everyone: your property is less likely to be damaged or burglarized, which means you’re less likely to make an insurance claim, which means your insurance company is less likely to have to pay out on that claim.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember about <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">safety discounts</a> is that they vary from one insurance company to another. So before investing in any major upgrades, check with your insurance carrier to see whether you qualify for a discount for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Installing a security system</strong>. Most home insurance companies offer a premium discount for a security system, but check with your carrier to make sure your specific system qualifies.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining other safety features</strong>. Smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, smart appliances – all these things can make your home and your family safer, which means an insurance company may tie them to lower premiums.</li>\n<li><strong>Getting a new roof</strong>. Depending on where you live, updating your roof so that it’s resistant to tornadoes, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, or hail can qualify you for a deal on your insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"formoregreatdealsjustask\">For More Great Deals, Just Ask</h2>\n<p>We can’t emphasize enough that the coverage and discounts available to you depend almost entirely on your insurance carrier. If you’re looking for ways to save money on your homeowners insurance or to add more coverage, call your provider and ask about what's available. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you learn.</p>"

      title: "Best Time to Sell a House: Is 2021 Your Year?"
      body: "<p>We’ve been in a real estate seller’s market for all of 2022, which simply means there are more people who want to buy a home than there are houses up for sale. It’s hard to say when the market might cool, but does that mean you should list your house today? This guide can help you decide if this truly is the best time to sell a house.</p>\n<p>For those of you on the other side of the equation, check out our tips on <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a home in a seller’s market</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentosellyourhouse\">When to Sell Your House</h2>\n<p>Unless you have to relocate for work or family reasons, the decision to sell your home can be very personal. Your home is likely filled with tons of memories, and realtor {{< external-link url=\"https://cameronmiller.ca/\" text=\"Cameron Miller\" >}} points out, this “requires the courage to let it go and the patience to anticipate a probable buyer.”</p>\n<p>In addition to emotional preparedness, there are other practical and financial indicators that tell you it’s a good time to sell, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have either too much or not enough house.</strong> Are you an empty nester who wants to lower your mortgage payments? A new parent who just realized they need a bit more space? Big life changes often mean rethinking what you want out of your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Your home is worth more than you owe.</strong> You can figure out if you’ve built enough equity in your home by subtracting your mortgage balance from your home’s estimated value. If the difference is enough to pay off your mortgage and provide a decent down payment on your next home, you may be ready to sell.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest rates have dropped.</strong> This means that new home buyers can probably buy a more expensive home, and you can afford the rates on a new mortgage after the sale.</li>\n<li><strong>You have money in the bank.</strong> You also want to have enough cash for selling and relocating, and it’s probably best to be out of debt. This puts you in the best position to buy a new home, pay the movers, and handle repairs your buyer requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you have cash on hand when you sell, it’s also a good idea to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-budget-after-buying-a-house/\">budget for repairs</a> and upgrades to your new home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebesttimeofyeartosellahouse\">The Best Time of Year to Sell a House</h2>\n<p>Most of the real estate agents we asked noted spring as the best time to sell a house. Ron Wysocarski of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.ronsellsthebeach.com/\" text=\"Wyse Home Team Realty\" >}} in Port Orange, Florida says the first two weeks of May are particularly strong. “Typically, a property listed during this time gets sold 18.5 days faster. Also, you can expect 5.9% more money.”</p>\n<p>However, that tip may be specific to Florida. Sean Kaufman, an agent with the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.compass.com/agents/sat/\" text=\"Shii Ann Huang Team\" >}} at Compass in New York City, finds March to be “ideal for families, since the winter holidays are over and there are several months before the children are all home from school again.”</p>\n<p>This means you really need to research your local market to get an idea of when the best time to sell a house is for your area. An experienced realtor is a good way to make sure you have a solid understanding of your area’s real estate market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebestdaytolistyourhouse\">The Best Day to List Your House</h2>\n<p>Again, the real estate agents we asked were generally in agreement that closer to the weekend tend to be the best days for listing your home. Some, like Robi Schreckhise of {{< external-link url=\"https://exprealty.com/\" text=\"eXp Realty\" >}} think Friday is best: “Over the past year, homes have been receiving multiple offers in the first two to three days of being listed.” Listing on Friday, he says, “gives sellers all weekend to show the home and accept an offer by Sunday night.”</p>\n<p>Others, however, prefer Thursday. Like Omer Reiner of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floridacashhomebuyers.com/fort-lauderdale/\" text=\"Florida Cash Home Buyers, LLC\" >}} says, “That’s just before the weekend when potential buyers are more likely to view listed houses so the house is more likely to sell.” Moreover, Wednesdays and Thursdays top the lists for the best days to get a quick sale and to get an above-list sale in many areas of the country.</p>\n<p>This is another decision where a licensed real estate professional can be a great deal of help. Someone who knows your market can help you figure out what’s going on and how to get the most out of your home.</p>\n<p>It also means sellers probably want to have their homes ready for weekend showings by midweek. Keep your home clean and ready to show prospective buyers. This may be difficult to manage with all the responsibilities of the week, but well worth it when you look at the trends.</p>"

      title: "How to buy a house in South Carolina: A comprehensive guide"
      body: "<p>In recent years, there have been two significant factors that have caused more people to consider relocating and buying a home in different parts of the country that they may not have considered before.</p>\n<p>The first reason is the trend toward remote work. Working from home has allowed people to choose where they want to live for reasons other than their job.</p>\n<p>The second reason? Real estate prices have skyrocketed in metropolitan areas throughout the United States, causing many people to look at areas with a lower cost of living.</p>\n<p>Buying a house in South Carolina can be an excellent choice for the reasons listed above. Real estate values and living costs across the state are relatively affordable compared to other areas. Combine those benefits with the Palmetto State’s mild climate, natural beauty, and historic charm, and you see why South Carolina is a great choice when looking to buy a home.</p>\n<p>In this article, we explain how to buy a house in South Carolina and what cities you may want to consider when buying a home there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thingstoconsiderbeforebuyingahouseinsouthcarolina\">Things to consider before buying a house in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>Before you begin searching for houses, you need to think about where in the state you want to live. Living along the coast is a different experience than choosing a home in the Blue Ridge Mountains in terms of both climate and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>You also need to think about your career and job prospects in that area. This might be less of a concern if you’re a remote worker, but you still need to consider what you want out of the location you pick. Are you drawn to the quiet of a small town? Do you want to enjoy the amenities of a larger city? These are important questions to answer before you search for houses in South Carolina for sale.</p>\n<p>If you're already from South Carolina and are simply looking to relocate within the state, you’re probably already familiar with different regions and cities. But if you’re new to South Carolina,you want to consider which part of the state appeals to you most.</p>\n<p>For example, Clemson is a popular city for young professionals that offers affordable homes with a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Clemson_SC/overview\" text=\"median sold home price of $265,000\" >}}. Another option is the smaller city of Greenville, which has a thriving business district.</p>\n<p>South Carolina also offers many areas that may appeal to people looking to enjoy outdoor lifestyles and activities. With 78 acres of parks and greenways, the city of Mauldin is a good example that’s just about an hour away from Greenville. Median home prices in Mauldin are a bit higher than in Clemson, but you generally get more house for your dollar.</p>\n<p>Whatever you're looking for in a new home, South Carolina likely has something for you. But it’s essential to understand exactly what you want out of your new community first before deciding on a home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findingahouseinsouthcarolina\">Finding a house in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>There are several tools you can use to help you find currently listed homes in South Carolina. One of the best ways is to work with a local realtor who has experience in the state and the specific cities you are interested in.</p>\n<p>This is especially true if you’re coming from out of state. The internet can be a great resource for finding information on various cities, but nothing beats the advice of someone with years of experience in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Try to find your own realtor instead of simply working with the listing agent for the home you are considering. The listing agent works for the seller, so you want to balance the equation by getting an agent who will keep your best interest in mind during negotiations..</p>\n<p>Of course, you can use sites like Zillow and other popular real estate portals to do your own research. But when it comes time to look at houses and make offers, working with a professional real estate agent typically produces the best results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stepstotakebeforebuyingahomeinsouthcarolina\">Steps to take before buying a home in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a home</a> in South Carolina may have aspects unique to the state, many of the steps listed here are typical no matter where you’re looking. Use them to make your experience as smooth as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startbuildingyourdownpayment\">Start building your down payment</h3>\n<p>If you haven't already, start putting money aside for a down payment. Over the last year, lending criteria have tightened, so the more significant your down payment is, the more options you will have when buying a home in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>The general rule when looking for a home is to have 20% as a down payment ready to go. According to Zillow, this translates to about $53,000 based on the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.zillow.com/home-values/51/sc/\" text=\"median home prices in South Carolina\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Haven’t started saving up for that kind of down payment? Don’t lose hope! We know of at least <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">13 ways to afford a house</a>. One option is to look into the various government programs that help first-time buyers <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">get a home with no money down</a>. For example, the US Department of Veteran Affairs offers loans to eligible applicants, as does the US Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p>If you don’t qualify for these programs, you may want to investigate loan options from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). You may be eligible for an FHA loan with as little as 3.5% down depending on your credit score.</p>\n<p>You might also want to check out {{< external-link url=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/HomeBuyers\" text=\"state-run programs\" >}}, Some are designed specifically for first-time home buyers in South Carolina while others simply encourage homeownership. Examples from SC Housing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.schousing.com/home/HomebuyerProgram\" text=\"Homebuyer Program\" >}} that helps low-to-moderate income individuals and families afford mortgages by offering a competitive <a href=\"/blog/how-does-mortgage-interest-work/\">fixed-rate mortgage</a> and down payment assistance.</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/Palmetto-Home-Advantage\" text=\"Palmetto Home Advantage\" >}}, which offers several types of mortgages and forgivable down payment assistance to people with at least a 640 credit score.</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.schousing.com/Home/MortgageCreditCertificates\" text=\"Mortgage Tax Credit Certificates\" >}} that provide up to $2,000 in federal tax credit that homebuyers can use as additional income on their mortgage applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First-time home buyer grants in South Carolina usually have a set of criteria you must meet before you may qualify, so be sure to do your research.</p>\n<p>Make sure to look into these programs or ask your realtor about them. A little bit of extra work may help you save that down payment for other expenses and make the loan process easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosetherightrealtor\">Choose the right realtor</h3>\n<p>Choosing your realtor may be the most critical factor when determining whether or not your home purchase goes smoothly. A realtor has expertise in many of the things that you simply don’t know much about, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting pre-approved for a mortgage.</li>\n<li>Locating the right neighborhood for your budget and lifestyle.</li>\n<li>Identifying market conditions that may make it difficult to buy a home.</li>\n<li>Negotiating the best deal for you.</li>\n<li>Finding first-time homebuyer programs in South Carolina for which you may qualify.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons and more, real estate agents are an indispensable resource for any homebuyer.</p>\n<p>Some key questions to ask when deciding on a real estate agent are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How long have you been a real estate agent in the area?</strong> Longer is usually better.</li>\n<li><strong>How many transactions have you completed in the past year?</strong> Once again, more is generally better.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you work in my price range?</strong> A realtor who specializes in luxury homes may not be the best fit for those looking at starter homes.</li>\n<li><strong>How are your reviews?</strong> Although this can be a bit tricky to determine, someone with overall negative reviews may not be the best fit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, you don't have to pick the first agent you meet. Try to contact more than one and see which one fits your needs the best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gettingyourfinancesinorderformortgagepreapproval\">Getting your finances in order for mortgage pre-approval</h3>\n<p>You want to get pre-approved for a mortgage in your price range. This allows you to work more closely with an agent and is a sign to sellers that you’re a serious buyer who is ready to make an offer immediately.</p>\n<p>Once you get pre-approved, don't make any drastic financial decisions that could change your credit score. Buying a new car or racking up credit card debt after you’re pre-approved may cause problems when you try to finalize your loan.</p>\n<p>This may also be a great time to check your credit score and other financial information. Make sure there’s no false or outdated information that could cause you to pay a higher interest rate than you should. Going over your credit score may take some time, so it’s best to start well before you start applying for a loan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startshoppingforahouse\">Start shopping for a house</h3>\n<p>Once your real estate agent has been chosen and your pre-approved mortgage letter is in hand, you can start to shop for houses in your price range.</p>\n<p>The time of year you choose to buy a new home can have an impact on the market. Spring and summer tend to be busy periods for home buying, so that means more competition. Homes may not stay on the market as long, creating smaller inventories and sometimes higher prices.</p>\n<p>Fall and winter are typically slower months, so sellers may be more willing to bend prices. However, every situation is different, and there are no guarantees. (Another good reason to work with a professional real estate agent!)</p>\n<h3 id=\"makeanofferandcloseonyournewhomemake\">Make an offer and close on your new homemake</h3>\n<p>When you've found the perfect place, it's time to make an offer. This is another area where your agent can help. They will let you know what constitutes a good offer based on market conditions.</p>\n<p>So how much are houses in South Carolina? Zillow lists the median home price as around $267,835 at the time of writing. But you will set your offer based on the market you are shopping in.</p>\n<p>Deciding on how much to offer can be tricky. On the one hand, you want to get the best deal, but you also want to increase your chances of closing the deal. That’s a delicate balance that needs to work for both the buyer and the seller, and your agent plays a significant role in that process.</p>\n<p>Once the offer is accepted, you will move on to the closing process. <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">Closing costs</a> in South Carolina can include fees for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loan origination.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">Home inspections</a>.</li>\n<li>Credit reports.</li>\n<li>Attorneys.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">Home insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your agent can walk you through these and all the other fees, plus any paperwork that’s likely required..</p>\n<p>Once completed, you close on your new home!</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestareatoliveinsouthcarolina\">Best area to live in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>The best area to live in South Carolina really depends on your personal preference. The best place for a young, professional couple may not be the right choice for a retired couple looking for a relaxing country home. Thankfully, South Carolina offers something for almost every home buyer.</p>\n<p>Below is a selection of the most popular areas and what they have to offer to specific homebuyers. Median prices are all from February 2023.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clemson\">Clemson</h3>\n<p>One of the most popular locations in South Carolina, Clemson is great for families or professionals. Offering affordable homes, a thriving business district, and easy access to the Blue Ridge mountains makes this a great place to call home.</p>\n<p>Clemson University is also nearby, so this area trends younger. With median home prices right around $260,000, Clemson can be a great option for almost any budget.</p>\n<h3 id=\"greenville\">Greenville</h3>\n<p>Greenville is smaller than some of the cities on this list, but it still has a robust business district along with an arts and culture scene that defies its small size.</p>\n<p>Home prices are slightly higher here, with a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Greenville_SC/overview\" text=\"median price of $299,000\" >}}, but that’s still much lower than in other areas of the country. Greenville also caters to people of almost any age, so anyone from young adults to and retirees can feel comfortable making a home in Greenville.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mauldin\">Mauldin</h3>\n<p>This suburb of Greenville is great for those who want a little more space and a relaxing atmosphere while still being close to the city. Mauldin's schools rank as some of the best in the state, so it's perfect for families with young children. The more relaxed lifestyle also makes this a great choice for older home buyers.</p>\n<p>What makes this area even more appealing is the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Mauldin_SC/overview\" text=\"median price per square foot is $161\" >}}, making it one of the better deals in the state. Buyers looking for a lower cost of living will find a great option in Mauldin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"charleston\">Charleston</h3>\n<p>It's hard to find a more historic city than Charleston. This city is popular for its breathtaking landscape and rich history. Many of its streets are still paved with cobblestones, evidence of its roots that date back to the 1600s.</p>\n<p>However, Charleston is one of the pricier places to live in South Carolina. The median listed price for homes in the city is {{< external-link url=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Charleston_SC/overview\" text=\"$535,000\" >}}. That said, Charleston may be the perfect city for anyone who loves historical architecture and Southern charm appeals to you,</p>\n<h3 id=\"lexington\">Lexington</h3>\n<p>Near the state capital of Columbia, Lexington gives you access to the larger city while still providing the comforts of small-town life.

      title: "Can a landlord require renters insurance?"
      body: "<p>Can a landlord require renters insurance? In most states, they can – although, we recommend you check with local and state laws before you add anything to your leases. The better question is: Why would you want to?</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywouldalandlordrequirerentersinsurance\">Why would a landlord require renters insurance?</h2>\n<p>The answer to that is relatively simple too. While your <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> safeguards your interests, making sure your tenant has renters insurance, also called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 policy</a>, adds another layer of protection. We’ve listed seven ways it benefits a landlord to require renters insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1reducingyourchancesofbeingsued\">1. Reducing your chances of being sued</h2>\n<p>Maybe one of the best reasons for landlords to require renters insurance is that it can reduce their chances of a lawsuit. Tenants who have their own coverage are less likely to start pointing fingers when things go awry - and that can mean fewer headaches for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2helpingtopayadditionalexpensesinadisaster\">2. Helping to pay additional expenses in a disaster</h2>\n<p>Imagine owning a rental property where some sort of disaster makes the place uninhabitable, like a fire or hurricane. Your landlord insurance may cover the damage to the building and even your <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">lost rental income</a>. But it seldom pays your tenants’ relocation and additional living expenses.</p>\n<p>Renters insurance policies, however, usually have a loss of use provision that helps renters pay for temporary accommodations. Even if you’re not liable for those costs, tenants who have this coverage may be more likely to recover and return to your property quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3coveringtenantspersonalproperty\">3. Covering tenants’ personal property</h2>\n<p>Just like your tenants’ additional living expenses, your landlord insurance doesn’t cover your tenants’ personal property. So if their belongings are destroyed in a similar disaster, there’s a chance your tenant may sue you to replace them. This is less likely if you require renters insurance. Making coverage part of the rental agreement puts the responsibility on your tenant to have the right amount of coverage in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4beingpetfriendly\">4. Being pet friendly</h2>\n<p>Allowing renters to have a cat or dog may make your property more attractive to potential tenants, but pets can cause liability issues, including dog bites and property damage. This is one reason so many <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policies</a> have animal exclusions. If you do decide to allow pets, then you should require tenants to carry renters insurance that covers animal liability. Not requiring it could cause you to be dragged into a lawsuit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5limitingyourpolicyclaims\">5. Limiting your policy claims</h2>\n<p>When your renters have insurance, you may find you have fewer claims to file on your landlord insurance. That can be a big benefit to you because multiple claims can impact your premium. You should note, however, that requiring renters to have insurance can’t eliminate all potential claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6findingqualitytenants\">6. Finding quality tenants</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest jobs of a landlord is filling their rental properties with good tenants who pay their rent on time. Applicants who balk at the idea of carrying renters insurance may give you a heads-up about how financially responsible they are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7loweringyourdeductible\">7. Lowering your deductible</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies sometimes offer incentives for behaviors that make insuring a property more attractive. For example, we have a renters policy incentive <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> for landlords who require renters insurance. If a landlord has a claim and can provide proof that their tenant had insurance at least 14 days prior to filing, then we’ll reduce the landlord’s <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> by 50 percent or $750, whichever is lesser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchrentersinsuranceshouldalandlordrequire\">How much renters insurance should a landlord require?</h2>\n<p>How much renters insurance you require depends on several factors, but the most important of these is probably the value of your tenants’ personal belongings. Renters with $30,000 in property need at least that amount of coverage, plus around $100,000 in liability coverage. But every tenant is different, so you may want to discuss the specific coverage amount with each applicant before you add it into the lease.</p>\n<p>Being a landlord isn’t easy, but it can be a good way for homeowners to make extra cash.

      title: "Charleston, SC hurricane season: Are you prepared?"
      body: "<p>South Carolina may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of hurricanes, but the Palmetto State has definitely seen its share of storms. It ranks fifth on the list of states with the most hurricanes. Luckily, only five of those have been major hurricanes (i.e., Category 3 or above), but even a Category 1 hurricane can cause damage to roofs and siding.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to reduce your chances for this type of damage is by preparing for the Charleston, SC, hurricane season. Let’s take a look at when the hurricane season starts and how you can better prepare for a hurricane or tropical storm in Charleston.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whenishurricaneseasoninsouthcarolina\">When is hurricane season in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The hurricane season in South Carolina lasts from the beginning of June to the end of November. Typically, the peak months span between mid-August to mid-October, with September seeing the worst storms.</p>\n<p>Of course, some homeowners face a greater risk for hurricane damage because of where their homes are located. For homeowners in Charleston, SC, hurricane season is usually more risky. Their county has some 90 miles of coastline, making it more likely to see hurricanes than most of the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"charlestonschurricaneseasonhowtoprepare\">Charleston, SC, hurricane season: How to prepare</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most challenging part of preparing for hurricane season in South Carolina is getting started. Homeowners often push hurricane prep off because they’re unsure where to begin.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, start small with a list of preparation steps so you can check items off as you go. We’ve compiled several suggestions to get you started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getemergencysupplies\">Get emergency supplies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stock up on nonperishable foods like cans of vegetables and beans, rice, and other easily prepared items.</li>\n<li>Set aside money for emergencies like hotel stays, food, and other expenses.</li>\n<li>Don’t forget about your pets! You want to make sure you have a <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pet disaster preparedness plan</a> so your furry friends have what they need if you have to evacuate.</li>\n<li>Store enough clean water to last you and everyone in the house a few days. You may need drinking water, but you’ll also want to be able to cook and clean.</li>\n<li>Check your first aid kit to see if you have enough supplies to take care of everyone in your household. While you’re at it, stock up on any prescription medications so you have them on hand during an emergency.</li>\n<li>Keep all of your vehicles fueled up and consider having an extra gas can filled and accessible. As the storm nears, it might also be a good idea to have a vehicle relatively packed for a quicker evacuation.</li>\n<li>Buy a backup generator, a fire extinguisher, and extra flashlights. Keep extra batteries with your emergency supplies.</li>\n<li>Find a safe, water-proof place to store all your important documents like medical information and identification documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it doesn’t exactly fall in the category of “emergency supplies,” insurance is another important item to check. Make sure all your insurance policies are up to date and active, including your <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina homeowners policy</a>, flood coverage, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. Having solid coverage in place before a storm hits can help you recover from Charleston hurricane damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"planforemergencyscenarios\">Plan for emergency scenarios</h3>\n<p>Another important step in getting ready for hurricane seasons is planning for the various emergency situations you might face during a major storm. For this step, you might want to start with scenarios within your household and work outward.</p>\n<p>For instance, emergency services will likely be busy during a hurricane, so you want to make sure people in your household know basic first aid, how to work the fire extinguisher, and other critical skills. Here are a few common emergency situation you can plan for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power outages</strong>. What will you do if the power goes out? How will you cook food or charge critical electronics and other essential appliances? Get tips in our article <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prep-for-a-power-outage/\"><em>How to prep for a power outage.</em></a></li>\n<li><strong>Communications</strong>. Do you have a way to communicate with emergency services and stay updated with the latest information during a hurricane? If not, it may be time to invest in a hand-cranked or solar power emergency radio.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical.</strong> Does everyone in the household know how to use all the first aid equipment and other lifesaving techniques?</li>\n<li><strong>Flooding</strong>. Hurricanes typically cause flooding, so knowing <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-flood/\">what to do during a flood</a> is key to your disaster plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Evacuations</strong>. Where will you go if you need to evacuate your home? Are you going to a local shelter or staying with family in a safer area? Do you have more than one route for getting to a safer location? You want to answer all of these questions, and write down your plans and routes so you don’t forget in the heat of the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> You may not have a lot of time to evacuate, so you might want to put together a grab-and-go kit with essentials, such as food, medications, and cash.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prepareasastormapproaches\">Prepare as a storm approaches</h3>\n<p>Hurricanes are one of the few catastrophes that give some warning. That means you may have some time to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Board up windows with shutter boards or plywood.</li>\n<li>Put appliances on counters or move them to the second floor.</li>\n<li>Secure fences, bring in patio furniture, and tie down any fixtures in your yard.</li>\n<li>Move your vehicles into a protected area like a garage and preferably on higher ground.</li>\n<li>Check the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.scemd.org/prepare/know-your-zone/\" text=\"evacuation zones in South Carolina\" >}}. (Authorities announce evacuations based on these zones.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever you do, pay attention to the latest weather updates and emergency notifications. If you’re asking yourself, “Is Charleston, SC, being evacuated?” check the city's website. It lists Charleston evacuation plans that include {{< external-link url=\"https://www.charlestoncounty.org/departments/emergency-management/hurricane.php#zones\" text=\"evacuation zones\" >}} and {{< external-link url=\"https://www.charleston-sc.gov/1693/Transportation-Evacuation\" text=\"pick-up points\" >}} for people who need transportation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startingyourhurricaneseasonpreparation\">Starting your hurricane season preparation</h2>\n<p>The Charleston, SC, hurricane season might seem a long way off, but it’s really just around the corner.

      title: "Climate Change Is Transforming Home Insurance"
      body: "<p>The homeowners insurance industry is built on risk models that help companies decide which homes to insure and which ones to walk away from. Forecasting how much they might pay in claims allows insurers to cover those costs. The more accurate an insurance company’s predictions are, the more likely it is for the company to be profitable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, climate-related risks, such as rising seas, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, and worsening droughts, have made the old forecasting models nearly obsolete. And when insurance companies aren’t sure what the risks are, they take steps to protect themselves. This often means leaving areas most exposed to climate-related risks.</p>\n<p>Kin is different because we're built to tackle the climate crisis head on. How? By integrating weather modeling into our tech infrastructure, we get <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">ultra-granular exposure measurement</a> that enables us to serve high-exposure markets.</p>\n<p>In non-insurance speak? We look at a lot more (and a lot better) data so homeowners in places like California, Florida, and Louisiana pay less for essential coverage.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhECgrwRlgI?autoplay=0&rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Video Transcription</em></p>\n<p><em>[Sean Harper speaking] As the world warms, the weather is getting much more extreme. Last year (2020) we got hit by five hurricanes in the United States. That's more than we've ever been hit by before. The last four years have been historic wildfire years in all of the American West. So legacy insurance companies crave stability, and they have a hard time responding when anything changes. And so what you see happen is in places where the weather becomes more extreme, more variable, the big insurance companies that you know of, they often just pull out, which leaves people who live in those areas with a really big problem which is they can't get insurance. They can't get good insurance. At Kin, we've built an insurance company that can respond really fast to change. We can do that because we're high tech and because we're using a lot of data that's never been used in the industry before. That allows us to provide insurance in places where other companies can’t, which is really important because you can't actually live there unless you're able to get insurance.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whytraditionalinsurancecompaniesarentreadyforclimatechange\">Why Traditional Insurance Companies Aren’t Ready for Climate Change</h2>\n<p>Legacy insurance companies are built on outdated and inflexible technology. This makes it difficult – even impossible – for them to respond quickly to new information and external changes. Most also rely on just a few details to figure out how risky a home is to insure, and much of the information they get comes directly from the person applying for coverage. Those answers for some key questions are often guesses at best.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest problem for traditional insurance providers is that they think they can outrun climate change. Put simply, climate change is a global problem, and there won't be anywhere to run in 10 years. Still, legacy insurers are responding by tightening their underwriting guidelines, and the few consumers who fit those guidelines may find themselves priced out of coverage.</p>\n<p>The data insurers need to improve their ability to insure homes in high-risk areas is available. And it's time to adapt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimpactofclimatechangeonfloridahomeownersinsurance\">The Impact of Climate Change on Florida Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Right now, it's hard to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a>. Insurance companies have been paying out large claim settlements for catastrophic storms for years, but climate change has upped the price tag, causing insurers to either raise premiums or opt out of the Sunshine State altogether. In fact, insurance companies in Florida {{< external-link url=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2021/05/20/three-florida-property-insurers-will-drop-a-total-of-50000-policies/\" text=\"recently dropped 50,000 policyholders\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Just because you already have insurance doesn't make you safe from losing it. An insurance company can choose not to renew coverage when your policy expires. This is called a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">non-renewal</a>, and insurance companies sometimes use it to get risky homes off of their books. With more homes exposed to natural disasters because of climate change, more insurance providers are non-renewing homeowners policies to better protect their bottom line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeskininsurancerespondtoclimatechange\">How Does Kin Insurance Respond to Climate Change?</h2>\n<p>While it's true <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">every home will likely be impacted by climate change</a>, that doesn't mean every home will be impacted the same way. Everything from the building materials to the foundation type to the terrain it's built on can impact a home's ability to survive major damage.</p>\n<p>That’s why we retrieve reliable data from a variety of sources, including the government, satellite images, and real estate archives. Once we’ve collected this data, we use advanced technology to analyze it thoroughly. This allows us to get more accurate readings of how much money a home should be paying for insurance – even in regions that are repeatedly bombarded by hostile weather. The end result is affordable home insurance for more people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customercareduringdisastersclaims\">Customer Care During Disasters &amp; Claims</h3>\n<p>Claims can be particularly tricky for legacy insurance companies because of the influx of losses during a catastrophic event. Overloaded, already slow systems mean long wait times for customers to even file claims. Long processing times often leave customers wondering if they’ll ever see their damaged homes repaired.</p>\n<p>Our solution is to create systems that interact with customers directly during a crisis. First, we text customers who are in harm’s way with resources to help them prepare. Then we send a post-storm text to find out if they’re safe and to get information we need if they’ve suffered any damage, including pictures that can help us get a claim started for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattheclimateemergencymeansfortheinsuranceindustry\">What the Climate Emergency Means for the Insurance Industry</h2>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">recent climate report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, the climate emergency is here and it’s already impacting our lives. As climate change intensifies, it will continue to impact home insurance. Premiums will likely keep rising and quality coverage will be harder to get.</p>\n<p>However, that’s only true if insurance companies can’t adjust to changing times. At Kin, we know better data and direct-to-consumer distribution are key to handling the new normals that climate change brings. We’re not only better able to assess risk, but we can also help our customers best mitigate it.</p>"

      title: "Why aren’t insurers ready for climate change?"
      body: "<p>The impact of climate change on the insurance industry is substantial. As more frequent and severe storms hit cities across the US, more people are experiencing catastrophic losses. The increase in these losses forces many traditional insurance companies to raise their home insurance rates. Some have even found the situation so unmanageable that they’re pulling out of high-risk regions, or worse, becoming insolvent.</p>\n<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way, at least that’s what our co-founder and CEO Sean Harper. believes. He acknowledges that climate change is terrible and needs to be stopped. However, he also points out that the impact of climate-related risks like hurricanes is something we can model. And that means that while it may be a large expense, it's a manageable one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howclimatechangeimpactshomeinsurance\">How climate change impacts home insurance</h2>\n<p>The impact of climate change has been an area of concern for the insurance industry going back at least two decades. But as the number of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions\" text=\"billion-dollar disasters\" >}} steadily increases, so does the anxiety. The cost of paying a large number of catastrophic claims means many insurers have to rethink their <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a> and even their ability to sell policies in some locations.</p>\n<p>For homeowners, that turns into two for important questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Will I be able to find <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>?”</li>\n<li>“Will I be able to pay for it if I do?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take Florida as an example. Hurricanes batter the state’s coastline every year. Add to that the increased cost of doing business in Florida, and it’s easy to see <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">why insurers raise premiums</a>, send <a href=\"/glossary/non-renewal/\">non-renewal notices</a> to homeowners, or leave the state altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyinsurersshouldbepreparedforclimatechange\">Why insurers should be prepared for climate change</h2>\n<p>Climate change is going to cause big expenses for <a href=\"/glossary/property-and-casualty-insurance/\">property and casualty insurance</a>, and the costs are most likely going to be passed on to consumers. One {{< external-link url=\"https://www.karenclarkandco.com/news/publications/\" text=\"report on insured wind losses\" >}} shows that our warming climate has caused more Category 3 and above hurricanes. The additional storms have already pushed losses up by 11 percent above what we’d expect if climate change wasn’t a factor.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the report also says global temperatures are projected to increase by an additional 0.4 to 1.3 degrees C by 2050 and that will most likely cause average annual hurricane wind losses to increase an additional 10 to 19 percent by 2050. That’s a big jump, but it’s spread out over 30 years. Plus, insurance companies have this information and can use it to prepare for the cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howinsurerscanprepareforclimatechange\">How insurers can prepare for climate change</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies have to incorporate climate science when they create their catastrophe models, but they can also use technology that helps them price their policies more fairly. For example, we’ve done this by taking in more information about every homeowner that applies for coverage. Looking at this <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data</a>, much of it from public records, allows us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set premiums that more accurately reflect the actual risk for each home.</li>\n<li>Ask <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-questions/\">fewer questions on our application</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, these two outcomes make getting insurance easier.</p>\n<p>Technology is also key to speedy claims process, as you can see in <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-ida-case-study/\">our response to Hurricane Ida</a>. Because we have access to so much data, we were able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how our customers might be impacted by the storm.</li>\n<li>Alert them that the storm was coming and provide safety tips and shelter listings.</li>\n<li>Send post-storm wellness checks.</li>\n<li>Get aerial imagery for 94 percent of our impacted customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another step that <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> can take is to use <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">reinsurance</a> to protect their business in the event numerous policies have to be paid out at once. Essentially, reinsurance is a contract between your insurance company and a reinsurer. The insurance company pays the reinsurer to take on some of the risk that comes with covering homes. By passing on some of its risk to the reinsurer, the insurance company is able to offer more affordable coverage in areas that are prone to certain, catastrophic <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important way insurance companies can help their policyholders is to educate them about their risks. <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">Home insurance discounts</a> are one way we encourage our customers to take action, but we also provide educational content on things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">Florida wind mitigation</a>.</li>\n<li>Basic <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">Disaster preparedness</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these can help homeowners harden their property against damage – and that can reduce their chances of filing claims.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the impact of climate change on the insurance industry may be unavoidable, but it’s also predictable. Insurance companies have to find ways to get homeowners the protection they need at an affordable price.</p>"

      title: "Climate change’s impact on hurricanes increasing"
      body: "<p>Hurricane season is well underway, which means homeowners along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast are (hopefully!) prepared for the possibility of fierce storms hitting their homes. But it looks like climate change’s impact on hurricanes means people beyond this area may see more named storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morepeopleexposedtohurricanerisk\">More people exposed to hurricane risk</h2>\n<p>According to a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00859-1\" text=\"study published in Nature Geoscience\" >}}, tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes in the Western hemisphere; typhoons in the Eastern hemisphere) are moving towards midlatitude regions. The expanding storm zone exposes more people and properties to hurricane risk, including those in high-density cities like Boston and New York.</p>\n<p>The basis for the changes is a shift in wind patterns known as {{< external-link url=\"https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/hadley.html\" text=\"Hadley cells\" >}} that create jet streams. In Hadley cells, warm air at the equator rises, cools as it moves towards a pole, and then sinks as cold air returns to the equator. Unfortunately, warmer temperatures at higher latitudes pull the jet streams towards midlatitude regions and can potentially bring hurricanes with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesclimatechangeaffecthurricanes\">How does climate change affect hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Before we discuss how climate change affects hurricanes, let’s take a quick look at how these powerful storms form. According to the National Ocean Service, hurricanes start when a low pressure system causes warm, humid air near the ocean’s surface to rise. The air cools as it rises, forming clouds and thunderstorms. At the same time, warm air from the surrounding area takes its place in the low pressure system. The pattern continues, creating the rotating clouds we see in hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Hurricanes require warm ocean temperatures and humid air﹘two conditions common in tropical regions. But climate change has made both more prevalent, and scientists say that may {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\" text=\"transform how hurricanes act\" >}} in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expanding storm zone.</strong> As we already noted, hurricanes are finding their way to northern regions more frequently and putting more people in harm’s way.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher wind velocity.</strong> Experts anticipate hurricanes will have higher wind velocities as ocean temperatures rise. Essentially, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, creating stronger winds and more hazardous conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased rainfall.</strong> Warmer air can {{< external-link url=\"https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/ocean-observation/understanding-climate/air-and-water/\" text=\"hold more water vapor\" >}} than cooler air. The result is the potential for wetter storms and an increase in flooding in many communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Slower moving storms.</strong> Scientists have yet to figure out why, but hurricanes have {{< external-link url=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/616814022/hurricanes-are-moving-more-slowly-which-means-more-damage\" text=\"slowed by 10 percent\" >}}. Many believe that warmer temperatures mean there is less difference in pressure between the poles and tropics, slowing down the currents that carry storms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long story short? Climate change is increasing the impact of hurricanes for more people than ever before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"otherwaysclimatechangeimpactsweather\">Other ways climate change impacts weather</h3>\n<p>Scientists say that climate change has impacts beyond the frequency and ferocity of hurricanes. With the changing climate comes warmer summers, colder winters, and generally more volatile, less predictable weather. Tornado alley – long a staple of the American midwest – has actually <a href=\"/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">shifted east</a> in recent years to now include much of the American south.</p>\n<p>The ways in which <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change affects homes</a> and homeowners are significant. As climate change rearranges weather patterns, it also alters the risk homeowners – in terms of both the type and severity of damage caused by extreme weather. These impacts are already causing home insurance premiums to go up in areas already feeling the consequences of climate change</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparingforhurricanesmovingforward\">Preparing for hurricanes moving forward</h2>\n<p>When it comes to hurricanes, knowledge is power. You can take steps to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare for hurricane</a> by fortifying your home against the possibility. Depending on your situation, that might mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning an evacuation route.</li>\n<li>Purchasing hurricane supplies, like a generator, spare gas, and sand bags.</li>\n<li>Installing <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> and a wind-rated garage door.</li>\n<li>Making a disaster kit.</li>\n<li>Storing valuable and important papers above the ground floor in a waterproof pouch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to be prepared to either shelter in place or evacuate, and you should have a clear plan for either option. Either way, you want to have enough emergency supplies to sustain yourself and your family after a storm hits because it may be days or weeks before emergency help can assist.</p>\n<p>Next, increasing hurricane risk means you want to review your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most home insurance policies cover damage caused by hurricane winds, but water damage is another issue. If your hurricane risk has gone up, then you might want to invest in <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, take a good hard look at your insurance company.

      title: "Controlling home insurance costs in Florida | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>Florida home insurance is expensive, to say the least. Our most recent data shows the average Floridian pays just under $2,000 per year for their coverage. That makes the Sunshine State the third most expensive for homeowners insurance, just behind Louisiana and Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the state legislature has signed bills to hopefully bring homeowners some relief from <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida’s increasing insurance rates</a>. Unfortunately, it’s going to take some time before the new laws’ impact makes its way to the people who need it the most. Until that happens, it’s up to Florida homeowners to figure out how they can control their home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>That’s where we can help. Our Kinfolk have decades of industry experience under their collective belts, so we know a thing or two about saving money on home insurance. Here are a few ideas for Florida homeowners who want to control their insurance costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardenyourhomeagainstrisk\">Harden your home against risk</h2>\n<p>Does it seem unlikely that an insurance company would want to help homeowners lower their insurance costs? In a recent <a href=\"/blog/you-asked-we-answered/\">Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit</a>, our CEO Sean Harper acknowledged that it might seem counterintuitive, but pointed out that when homeowners live in a safe home, “we pay less for <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance/\">reinsurance</a> we need to insure that home.”</p>\n<p>Florida state law requires <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> to set premiums that cover their reinsurance costs and the claims they expect to have. So basically, when reinsurance prices go up, insurers that rely on reinsurance have to raise their rates, too.</p>\n<p>Hardening your home against risk can go a long way towards controlling your home insurance premiums. In Florida, a large part of the overall premium is driven by hurricane risk, but homeowners can mitigate that risk by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Securing your roof.</strong> Roofs in need of repair are more vulnerable to wind and rain, so start by inspecting your roof for <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">signs of damage</a>. You may also want to consider improving your roof-to-wall attachments. Florida home insurers give discounts to homeowners with <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Protecting your windows.</strong> Whether you get <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> or impact-resistant windows, you want to guard against flying debris that could damage your windows and let rain in.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps and cracks.</strong> Keeping water out is a major concern, so check the exterior of your home for openings and seal them up with caulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Diverting water. Y</strong>ou want your gutters to move water away from your foundation, but they can’t do that if they’re clogged with debris. Keep them clean and set up downspouts to divert water.</li>\n<li><strong>Trimming your trees.</strong> Hurricane winds can knock down even healthy branches, so hire a professional to trim them back and to remove dead or dying trees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners can also look to {{< external-link url=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\" text=\"My Safe Florida Home\" >}}, a program that provides owners of site-built, single-family, residentials properties with funds for hurricane mitigation inspections and home-strengthening improvements. Recent legislation allocated $150 million in funds to the program. </p>\n<h2 id=\"understandhowyourcoverageworks\">Understand how your coverage works</h2>\n<p>No one expects homeowners to be experts on their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> – that would be asking a lot! But the more you know, the better you can control your costs. For example, insurance companies usually offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for behaviors that are beneficial to them, like installing security alarms. State governments can do that too, which is why so many Florida homeowners know to ask their insurers about <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspections</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">Deductibles</a> are another coverage feature that you can use to control your costs. Essentially, a deductible is the amount of risk you’re responsible for in a loss. If you’re comfortable taking on more of the risk, you can increase your deductible to lower your premium.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that you want to select a deductible you can afford even if you’re hit with a catastrophic loss.</p>\n<p>Another feature of your policy that you may want to look into is how your property is valued. Typically, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>, the part that insures the structure of your home, is based on your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This means their insurers don’t subtract depreciation when figuring out the amount of the loss in a claim.</p>\n<p>However, Florida homeowners with older roofs may want a policy that has a schedule for your roof based on its age. Instead of paying for a brand new roof, a policy with a <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">roof surfacing replacement endorsement</a> pays a specific percentage of what your roof is worth based on its age. This can save you a lot in premium, but it does mean you get less money if your roof is damaged. Again, the key is figuring out what you can afford and weighing it against what amount of risk you’re comfortable with.</p>\n<p>We should note that the Florida Senate Bill 2D prohibits insurers from refusing to insure or renew a homeowner’s policy with a roof that is less than 15 years old solely based on its age. If your roof is at least 15 years old and your insurer requires you to replace your roof before it will issue or renew your policy, then you’re allowed to pay for a roof inspection. If that inspection reveals your roof has 5 or more years of useful life left in it, then your insurer cannot deny coverage based on your roof’s age.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shoparound\">Shop around</h2>\n<p>One common misconception about home insurance is that policies are all the same. What you buy from Insurance Company A varies little from Insurance Company B, so it doesn’t really matter which policy you choose.</p>\n<p>But as our CEO pointed out during the AMA, insurance companies all have different algorithms they use to price and quantify risk. As a result, premiums, and what you get for them, can vary quite a bit, so it just makes good sense to look at several companies before you decide. Just remember that when you <a href=\"/blog/how-to-compare-home-insurance/\">compare home insurance policies</a>, you want to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium.</li>\n<li>Coverage limits.</li>\n<li>What’s covered.</li>\n<li>What’s not covered.</li>\n<li>Claims processes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/reviews/\">Customer reviews</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also apply this tip to the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a house</a>. Most people know that you want to look at several homes before you make an offer, but we think you should also keep insurance in mind as you shop.</p>\n<p>New homes are typically less expensive to insure because they’re more likely to meet modern building codes. Plus, owners of newer homes often benefit from innovations in construction methods and building materials.</p>\n<p>Focusing your location more inland means you’ll find more homes that haven’t been as adversely impacted by extreme weather as those closer to the water. And narrowing your search even further by avoiding high risk flood zones can also help you control your overall home insurance costs.</p>\n<p>Seeing your home insurance rates go up year after year can be incredibly frustrating, but there are things you can do now to help you take control of those costs. Whether you make updates to your home, adjust your coverages, or shop for a new insurer, you can be better equipped to weather the storm until reforms improve the situation.</p>"

      title: "Cost of Home Improvements by Popular Projects"
      body: "<p>The real estate market tends to heat up with the weather. Unfortunately, housing prices are soaring this year, and that’s making it difficult for house hunters to find the home of their dreams.</p>\n<p>If <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a home in a seller’s market</a> seems impossible, then maybe it’s time to think about remodeling. You may find that an updated kitchen or an additional bathroom makes all the difference in your home. Even better, remodeling often increases your home’s value, which can come in handy when you do finally sell.</p>\n<p>However, some of the issues that are driving up home prices, such as supply chain issues and inflation, also impact the cost of home improvement projects. We took a look at the price tag for popular renovations so you can plan a realistic budget for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourkitchen\">Remodeling Your Kitchen</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-project-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>The median price for remodeling a kitchen is $12,000.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>According to the {{< external-link url=\"https://st.hzcdn.com/static/econ/2021--US-Houzz-and-Home-Study.pdf\" text=\"Houzz & Home survey\" >}}, kitchen renovations are some of the most popular upgrades, accounting for 27 percent of interior home improvement projects in 2021. As with most remodels and renovations, the cost depends on the size of the undertaking. You could spend just a few thousand dollars to replace your cabinets or $100,000 to make your kitchen into a dream cooking space. That said, the median price is $12,000, but homeowners with kitchens larger than 200 square feet spent 14 percent more for major overhauls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourmasterbathroom\">Remodeling Your Master Bathroom</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-project-master-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Remodeling larger bathrooms ends up costing more.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>For many homeowners, their master bathroom is their oasis, making it another popular room to renovate. But even when the space is small, remodeling it can be expensive. The median price tag is $8,000, but bathrooms over 100 square feet went up dramatically. Those costs homeowners around $18,000 for a complete remodel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remodelingyourguestbathroom\">Remodeling Your Guest Bathroom</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-project-guest-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Homeowners spent a median $3,200 on remodeling their guest bathrooms.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>The Houzz survey revealed that 25 percent of homeowners chose to renovate their guest bathrooms rather than their master bathrooms. Price could be a big factor here, as the median cost is just $3,200. And spending on high traffic areas can mean more impact for less money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installinghardwoodfloors\">Installing Hardwood Floors</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-project-floor.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Installing hardwood floors costs up to $4,000 per 200 square feet.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Noncarpet flooring is a popular choice with many homeowners. Thirty-eight percent of them purchased it compared to just 14 percent who chose carpet for their homes. While this can seem like an easy project, it can be a significant and costly undertaking. Hardwood flooring can cost from $2,400 to $4,000 for every 200 square feet to install, so you may want to consider an alternative, like engineered wood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automatinghomesystems\">Automating Home Systems</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-improvements-tech.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Smart automation systems can help you save on energy costs.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Not all home improvement projects focus on cosmetics. For example, using smart technology to automate your home’s thermostat, sprinklers, and lighting is a growing trend. The median cost is just $400, but some of what you spend may come back to you as you save on energy costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradingyourplumbing\">Upgrading Your Plumbing</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-improvements-plumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <p align=\"center\"><i><small>The average homeowner spends $1,175 to upgrade their plumbing.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>The cost of most home improvements depends at least partially on your ambitions, and this may be particularly true when you want to upgrade your plumbing. Repiping an entire house can cost up to $15,000, depending on the type of plumbing pipe you want, while replacing a portion might only cost $360. The national average, however, is {{< external-link url=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/plumbing/install-new-plumbing-pipes/\" text=\"$1,174\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradingyourelectrical\">Upgrading Your Electrical</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-improvements-electric.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Upgrading electrical panels may cost as much as $4,000.</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Your home’s electrical systems may also need upgrading. In fact, homeowners with <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a> may find themselves ineligible for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Replacing these panels can cost between {{< external-link url=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/electrical/upgrade-an-electrical-panel/\" text=\"$500 and $4,000\" >}}, but other jobs, like installing under-cabinet lighting, often cost less.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paintingyourhomesexterior\">Painting Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-improvements-paint.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>A fresh coat of paint typically costs between $1,000 and $7,000</small></i></p></p>\n<p>Painting your home’s exterior not only helps protect it from the elements, but it’s an easy way to <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">boost your curb appeal</a>. The cost of painting the outside of a house is based largely on the number of stories and square footage and can range from $1,000 to $7,000. However, more difficult jobs can be more expensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingadeck\">Building a Deck</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cost-of-home-improvements-deck.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Decks add functional outdoor space and cost around $30 - $60 per square foot</small></i></p></p>\n<p>A deck is a great way to improve both the function and aesthetics of your home. You can use the extra space for parties, family gatherings, and even additional storage space. Plus, you’ll end up with less lawn work to do. The average cost of building a deck is about $30 to $60 per square foot.</p>"

      title: "Deck the Halls with These Easy Holiday Decor Ideas"
      body: "<p>Sometimes it feels like the magic of the holiday season is that you get more done than seems humanly possible. And between shopping for presents and planning holiday festivities, decorating your home can feel like just another item on a very long to-do list.</p>\n<p>But decor can be a fun and fast way to get in the holiday spirit. These 15 easy holiday decor ideas are a great place to start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1createagreencenterpiece\">1. Create a Green Centerpiece</h2>\n<p>Buying a centerpiece seems simple enough, but why spend extra when you can easily make your own with pine boughs and ornaments? Arrange these on a festive platter, and enjoy the scent of pine throughout the season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2deckyourdoorways\">2. Deck Your Doorways</h2>\n<p>Tabletops, stair railings, and mantles almost always get decorated. But you can lift a room’s holiday vibe by decking the doorways, too. Add inexpensive string lights to door frames to make them sparkle – extra credit for finding lights shaped like stars or snowflakes!</p>\n<h2 id=\"3changeupyourornaments\">3. Change Up Your Ornaments</h2>\n<p>Create your own tree ornaments with pine cones you find in your backyard or around your neighborhood. Keep them natural or spray paint them metallic gold, attach a small looped piece of string to the top with hot glue, and you're set! This is a fun activity for children (with supervision, of course!) and may even become a <a href=\"/blog/holiday-traditions-to-try-this-year/\">new holiday tradition</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4addgreenerytoyourmantle\">4. Add Greenery to Your Mantle</h2>\n<p>Between candlesticks and stockings, fireplace mantles can get a little overloaded with {{< external-link url=\"https://porch.com/advice/store-seasonal-decor-like-pro\" text=\"holiday decor\" >}}. Keep things subtle by laying long green pine boughs along the mantle with ribbons that match your <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design aesthetic</a>. This can tie together the overall look of your room.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5replaceyourtreeskirtwithaplanter\">5. Replace Your Tree Skirt with a Planter</h2>\n<p>The purpose of a tree skirt is to hide your tree stand, but that’s not the only option you have. Instead, kick it up a notch with a planter. You’ll still need your tree stand, but baskets and boxes can hide it just as well – as long as you find one that has a flat bottom and is wide enough for your stand. A true DIYer may want to decorate a cardboard box as a present and use that to hide their tree stand.</p>\n<p>Just make sure you can still water the tree if you have a real one! Dried out <a href=\"/blog/holiday-home-safety-tips/\">Christmas trees can be a fire hazard</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6createauniqueholidayscene\">6. Create a Unique Holiday Scene</h2>\n<p>Collectibles that create a holiday scene on your mantle have been around for years now. Create your own unique display with figurines that are important to you, whether that’s action figures, nutcracker dolls, or other items you’ve accumulated over the years. Simply use boxes to create different levels, white batting to simulate snow, and then place your figurines in whatever positions amuse you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7pickacolorscheme\">7. Pick a Color Scheme</h2>\n<p>Choosing two or three colors for your holiday decor goes a long way toward making your home look polished. This is true even if you’re drawn to colors not usually associated with winter holidays (hot pink, anyone?). Stick with your chosen colors – from gifts and ornaments to table linens and throw pillows – to create a cohesive and memorable palette.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8rethinkyourflowerarrangements\">8. Rethink Your Flower Arrangements</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to arrange flowers is to drop them in a lovely vase and leave them be. (This includes poinsettias, which often get left in the green planters they come in.) However, you might try clipping blooms and placing them in low glass dishes. You can even do that with poinsettia bracts – just be sure to burn the ends. This keeps the sap from oozing out and helps them live longer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9useevergreensandglass\">9. Use Evergreens and Glass</h2>\n<p>Glass containers can make anything look elegant. Place evergreen sprigs in glass containers of different shapes and sizes, such as candle holders and decanters, and then set them in various places throughout your home. This simple holiday home decorating idea is an easy and inexpensive way to make any space feel more festive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10makebottlebrushtrees\">10. Make Bottle Brush Trees</h2>\n<p>This is an activity your children will love! You can <a href=\"https://www.smilemercantile.com/blogs/tutorials/how-to-make-sisal-bottle-brush-trees-from-scratch-diy-craft-tutorial\">make your own bottle brush trees</a> using sisal fiber, floral wire, cork, and clothespins, or buy them pre-made and paint or dye them all sorts of fun colors. (You have to bleach the sisal fiber if you dye them, so you may want to do that step before your kids get involved.) You can use these as holiday decor on their own, but they could make an excellent addition to a holiday scene on your mantle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11updateyourwreath\">11. Update Your Wreath</h2>\n<p>Wreaths don’t have to be made from evergreen boughs. Instead, make them out of items that mean something to you, like family photos or materials that fit your decor, and then hang them throughout your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12hangyourstockingswithcare\">12. Hang Your Stockings with Care</h2>\n<p>Even without a fireplace, you can still make sure your stockings are hung with care. Just find a space with enough ledge to put a stocking holder on, like a bookshelf, kitchen island, or window frame. To make the area stand out, decorate it with other holiday items to create a festive tableau.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13accentyourchandelier\">13. Accent Your Chandelier</h2>\n<p>Your chandelier is already a focal point, so why not decorate it with berry garlands, paper dreidels, or colored ribbons? This can be the perfect accent for holiday dinner parties, but make sure your decoration don't touch the lights. No sense in risking a fire for style and charm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14addextrashimmertoyourcelebration\">14. Add Extra Shimmer to Your Celebration</h2>\n<p>Few things look more beautiful than candlelight, and you can create more sparkle with a few well-placed mirrors. Adding reflective surfaces to your mantle, bookcase, or even your tablescape can increase the delicate glow of the candles for a peaceful effect. Just be sure to keep your candles away from flammable items like fabric or paper, and never leave them burning while unattended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"15decoratewithcandy\">15. Decorate with Candy</h2>\n<p>Whatever your tradition, holiday-themed treats can be a fun way to celebrate. Filling glass jars with Hanukkah gelt or using {{< external-link url=\"https://thegardeningcook.com/diy-candy-cane-vase/\" text=\"candy canes to decorate a vase\" >}} is a great way to add some whimsy to your holiday decor.</p>"

      body: "<p>The person who helps you buy home insurance matters. But many people don’t know the difference between insurance agents and brokers.

Their goal is to facilitate the purchase of insurance with one of the carriers they represent.</p>\n<p>A critical benefit of working with an agent is that they can bind an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">insurance policy</a> for you. This means that you can get coverage by making the down payment of the policy while the policy is still being finalized in underwriting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"typesofinsuranceagents\">Types of insurance agents</h3>\n<p>Some agents represent only one carrier. These agents are referred to as “captive” agents because they only write policies for one carrier. Agents that are free to write policies for multiple carriers are referred to as “independent” agents.</p>\n<p>Since captive insurance agents only work for one company, they may have a greater understanding of the products offered because they are only expected to know what that specific company has. However, they are limited to only selling in that domain.</p>\n<p>Independent agents must know multiple companies' products, and that can result in greater flexibility and ability to compare policies. In fact, independent agents are often confused with insurance brokers because they can try to sell policies from any of the carriers they are affiliated with. Independent agents may not have as in-depth knowledge about a specific carrier’s insurance product, but they can shop between carriers to try to get a better rate for their client.</p>\n<p>All insurance agents get paid a commission for placing a policy with an insurance carrier. They do not charge additional fees like a broker can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesaninsurancebrokerdo\">What does an insurance broker do?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/shutterstock_616228190.jpg?width=300&name=shutterstock_616228190.jpg\" alt=\"An insurance broker on the phone, reviewing a file\" /></p>\n<p>Like an insurance agent, an insurance broker is an intermediary between the insurance buyer and the insurance company, representing the buyer.</p>\n<p>Insurance brokers cannot bind insurance policies. This means that they can only take the application and submit it to the insurance company. You don’t have coverage until the insurance company approves the application. Brokers operate by soliciting business from buyers and submitting their completed applications to the insurer. This may be a critical difference between agents and brokers if you need to get coverage quickly for a home purchase or mortgage application.</p>\n<p>Insurance brokers get paid a commission by the insurance company it places the policy with and may also charge a broker’s fee for shopping the policy around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"typesofinsurancebrokers\">Types of insurance brokers</h3>\n<p>An insurance broker can either operate by <em>retail or wholesale</em>. A <em>retail broker</em> generally deals directly with the customer to get them insurance and is more common than a wholesale broker. When you work with a retail broker, they will usually request quotes for you from different insurance companies to find you the best policy or the best price or both.</p>\n<p>However, not every policy can be handled by a retail broker. In instances where standard coverage is not available, like if you were trying to insure a <a href=\"/blog/high-value-home-insurance/\">high-value home</a> or a particularly risky property, the torch is passed to a <em>wholesale broker</em> whose line of work is more specialized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoifindanagentorbroker\">How do I find an agent or broker?</h2>\n<p>When you are buying a home, your real estate agent will usually connect you with their insurance agent or broker of choice. It often makes sense to explore this connection; your agent likely has a good feel for the local market, and they typically send you to people who they’ve had good experiences with before.</p>\n<p>However, you may want to do your research and ask neighbors. It can be too forward to ask for rates, but checking to see if they’ve had a positive experience can provide an unbiased option for review. You may also want to read {{< external-link url=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kin.com\" text=\"reviews of home insurance companies\" >}} as well agents and brokers, too.</p>\n<p>The important thing is to be confident in the relationship that you have with your agent or broker, and to be confident that you have the right coverage for your home at a price that suits your needs and leaves you covered for the biggest risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directtoconsumerinsurancecompanies\">Direct-to-consumer insurance companies</h2>\n<p>Our model is a little bit different than traditional insurers. While we do have licensed agents working for us, we mainly sell our <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> directly to consumers.

      title: "Do Credit Scores Affect Home Insurance Rates?"
      body: "<p>Your credit score <em>can</em> affect your home insurance rate, but how that works varies by where you live and who your insurer is. Some states, such as Florida, use credit scores when determining your home insurance premiums. While most people understand that insurance companies use credit, the majority of people don’t know how or why companies use it. Gaining insight on this can help you improve what insurance companies call your credit-based insurance (CBI) score, leading to better rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesyourcreditscoreaffectyourhomeinsurancerates\">How Does Your Credit Score Affect Your Home Insurance Rates?</h2>\n<p>Before we can explain how your credit score impacts your homeowners insurance premium, we have to define our terms. The credit score you may be thinking of ﹘the one that represents your credit risk ﹘ is not what we’re discussing here. That’s your Fair Isaac Corporation Score (FICO). Instead, we’re looking at your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">insurance score</a>, also called a credit-based insurance score (CBI).</p>\n<p>Both your FICO credit score and your CBI are based on information found in your credit report. However, insurance companies connect certain details in your credit history to your insurance risk, and that gives them an idea of how likely you are to file a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim</a> on your policy.</p>\n<p>Only seven states allow insurers to use your credit history to help determine your insurance rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California</li>\n<li>Hawaii</li>\n<li>Maryland</li>\n<li>Massachusetts</li>\n<li>Michigan</li>\n<li>Oregon</li>\n<li>Utah</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note that your credit score is only one of many factors that <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">impact your home insurance premium</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"factorsthatimpactinsurancescores\">Factors That Impact Insurance Scores</h3>\n<p>Every insurance company has its own method for calculating your insurance score. However, most consider these factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length of credit history.</strong> A longer credit history is usually looked on favorably, but what’s considered “long” can vary by insurer.</li>\n<li><strong>Bank and credit accounts.</strong> Having several accounts in good standing is usually a positive, but any accounts in collections typically have a negative impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Late payments.</strong> Fewer (or no) late payments is better for your insurance score.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit mix.</strong> Insurance companies often evaluate the types of debt you carry, such as student, auto, and <a href=\"/glossary/home-loan/\">home loans</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit applications.</strong> Applying for credit from multiple places can negatively impact your insurance score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the only details from your credit history that insurers may consider when determining your home insurance rates. Moreover, insurance companies weigh each component differently, so your CBI from one may not match what others assign to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownersinsurancecompaniesusecreditscores\">Why Do Homeowners Insurance Companies Use Credit Scores?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance companies use your credit history to determine your insurance score, and ultimately, your home insurance rates because they’ve found a correlation between creditworthiness and claims. By evaluating how a homeowner manages their finances, insurers can make reasonable calculations about how well the person takes care of their home. And when someone maintains their house, they’re less likely to file serious claims.</p>\n<p>But you should also know that insurance scores help reduce personal bias in the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a>. Every state has laws the prohibit insurance companies discriminating against consumers. However, if an underwriter didn’t have enough information, they sometimes had to go with their gut. Insurance scores allow underwriters to identify bad risks while minimizing the need for personal judgements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoimproveyourcreditscores\">How to Improve Your Credit Scores</h2>\n<p>Because your credit impacts so many aspects of your financial life, including insurance, it makes sense to keep your score as high as possible. Some simple ways to improve your credit score include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contesting inaccurate information on your credit report.</li>\n<li>Paying down revolving credit.</li>\n<li>Keep old credit accounts open, especially if they have a balance.</li>\n<li>Making a plan to pay off delinquent accounts.</li>\n<li>Paying your bills on time.</li>\n<li>Consolidating your debt for a better interest rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, you might not see much difference in your insurance score if you move from an average to a good credit score. But a poor credit score can have a big impact on your home insurance rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettinginsurancequotesdoesntaffectyourcreditscore\">Getting Insurance Quotes Doesn’t Affect Your Credit Score</h2>\n<p>People often worry about hard inquiries, the times a lender checks their credit history, impacting their overall credit score. That’s not a problem with insurance quotes because insurers make a soft inquiry, much like a utility company might make. You can <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get an insurance quote</a> anytime you want and not be concerned with your credit score getting dinged.</p>"

      title: "Does home insurance cover a fallen fence?"
      body: "<p>A wise man once said “Don’t ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.” But even if you follow that sage advice, your fence may still come down, which might make you wonder “Does home insurance cover a fallen fence?”</p>\n<p>The answer, as usual, is it depends on what caused your fence to fall and the particulars of your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>To be clear, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> typically covers fences and walls. This protection is found in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures coverage</a>, also called Coverage B. However, every policy is different, which means you also have to consider your policy’s language and coverage limits. Plus, most policies have a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard deductible</a> that needs to be met before coverage kicks in.</p>\n<p>All of that said, let’s take a look at some common situations that may cause your fence to fall to see what’s typically covered by home insurance. These can give you an idea of how coverage usually works, but you should still read your policy or talk to your agent about your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windstormblowsyourfenceover\">Windstorm blows your fence over</h2>\n<p>Our first scenario is your fence being blown over by a windstorm. In most instances, homeowners insurance covers wind damage, even when it has named-peril coverage, like an <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 policy</a>. So in the case of a windstorm, your fallen fence is likely covered.</p>\n<p>However, some homeowners may have different deductibles for wind damage, especially if they live in areas prone to hurricanes or tornadoes, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> that applies to damage caused by a named storm.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a> that applies to damage caused by wind, hail, tornado, or similar events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we said, home insurance typically covers windstorms, so most policies include tornado and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance coverage</a>. People who have these separate deductibles simply have a different financial obligation for specific types of storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atreefallsonyourfence\">A tree falls on your fence</h2>\n<p>When a tree falls on your fence, then the question is really whose home insurance policy pays for the damage. Take a look at a few different situations:</p>\n<h3 id=\"yourtreefallsonyourfence\">Your tree falls on your fence</h3>\n<p>If your tree is healthy but somehow falls on your fence and damages it, then your homeowners policy likely covers the damage. However, if your neglect or failure to maintain it causes your tree to fall, then your claim may be denied.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yourneighborstreefallsonyourfence\">Your neighbor’s tree falls on your fence</h3>\n<p>This one gets a little complicated. Let’s start with a neighbor who neglects their trees to the point that it falls on your fence. In that case, you could probably file a claim on your neighbor’s home insurance. The same goes for damage caused by a neighbor who is pruning their trees. If you file that claim on your policy, then your insurer may look to get compensated by your neighbor’s insurance company.</p>\n<p>But what if a giant wind or heavy snow causes your neighbor's tree to fall on your fence? That’s often a claim for your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>You should also note that some states consider trees on property lines to be both property owners’ responsibility – which means both you and your neighbor could end up bearing the cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acarcrashesintoyourfence\">A car crashes into your fence</h2>\n<p>A car careening through your fence may seem unlikely, but it does happen. When it does, it’s pretty alarming. This situation can be covered by either your home insurance or by the driver’s auto insurance.</p>\n<p>Making the claim on the driver’s insurance is often the better option because having fewer claims on your policy helps you lower your home insurance costs. It can even make you eligible for <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>. However, if you can’t collect from the driver, your insurance policy will likely cover your claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourfenceisvandalized\">Your fence is vandalized</h2>\n<p>Vandalism is another distressing situation for homeowners. But whether a vandal spray paints your fence, takes a bat to it, or otherwise wreaks havoc on it, you can usually rest assured that your home insurance policy covers the damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"woodrotcausesafallenfence\">Wood rot causes a fallen fence</h2>\n<p>Wood rot in a fence is typically only covered when it’s caused by a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>.</p>\n<p>Clear as mud, right?</p>\n<p>Basically, this means that wood rot caused by an event already covered by your home insurance, like a pipe burst, is usually covered. But rot caused by something else, say neglect, usually isn’t. Homeowners have the responsibility to maintain their homes, and that includes fences, so you want to properly treat any outside wood to repel water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"termitesdamageyourfence\">Termites damage your fence</h2>\n<p>Much like with wood rot, <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">home insurance covers termites</a> in just a couple of unique situations. These are when:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A covered peril causes an infestation.</li>\n<li>An unknown termite infestation causes a sudden collapse.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, termite infestations are more likely to appear when a homeowners doesn’t maintain their property or ignores signs of a growing problem. The result? Termite damage to your fence is seldom covered by your home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofileaclaimforfencedamages\">How to file a claim for fence damages</h2>\n<p>If you have fence damage resulting from a covered peril, you can (and should!) <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a>. The sooner you get your claim in motion, the faster your damage can be assessed and fixed. Contact your insurer's <a href=\"/claims/\">claims center</a> to explain what happened, and make sure to take pictures of the damage to support your claim.</p>"

      title: "Does Home Insurance Cover Civil Commotion?"
      body: "<p>As protests seeking justice for George Floyd took place across the country last week and continue, many homeowners are wondering if they’re covered for property damage that may accompany civil unrest.</p>\n<p>The short answer: yes.</p>\n<p>Your home and property are covered if they're damaged by fire, vandalism, or civil commotion. Let’s learn more about what “civil commotion” means in the insurance world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscivilcommotion\">What Is Civil Commotion?</h2>\n<p>Civil commotion is one of the covered perils in homeowners insurance policies. That’s true whether you have an <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho5-policy/\">HO5</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6</a>, HO7, or <a href=\"/glossary/ho8-policy/\">HO8</a> policy. Civil commotion is included in both <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named and open perils policies</a>, which at minimum cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li><strong>Riots or civil commotion</strong></li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Civil commotion usually refers to a public revolt that causes harm or property damage. It’s similar to a riot, a public disturbance by at least three people who leverage disorder to further a common purpose. The difference is a riot may or may not include property damage and is typically smaller in scale.</p>\n<p>Vandalism has a more straightforward definition: it’s intentional destruction of someone’s property. Vandalism may accompany civil commotion and riots.</p>\n<p>Your policy will usually not define civil commotion, riots, or vandalism outright, and legal definitions may vary depending on where you live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeshomeownersinsurancecovercivilcommotion\">How Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Civil Commotion?</h2>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/02/george-floyd-protests-live-updates/\">protests happening around the country right now</a> may, at one point or another, fit the category of “civil commotion.” As we saw in Minneapolis, Louisville, New York, Chicago, Columbus, Atlanta, and beyond, protestors have been met with heavy police intervention, with many states calling in the National Guard. In some cities, the chaos led to property damage and theft.</p>\n<p>While property damage has so far been limited to mostly commercial buildings, such as the Target in Minneapolis, it’s worth considering how residential property might be impacted if unrest continues.</p>\n<p>Say, for example, your community organizes a protest in support of police reform and ending extrajudicial violence. During the gathering, some outliers set fire to a trash can. The fire gets out of hand and spreads to a nearby home.</p>\n<p>The loss would be covered by homeowners insurance. In this case, it can pay for fire damage to the structure of the home and pay to replace damaged personal belongings.</p>\n<p>It may also trigger other coverages included in the policy, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>So if that fire made your home uninhabitable while it’s being repaired for fire and smoke damage, your loss of use insurance could help cover the extra costs you take on when damage displaces you. This coverage can pay for expenses beyond your “normal” obligations (like your mortgage and utilities).</p>\n<p>For example, loss of use insurance can pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Renting a new place temporarily</li>\n<li>A hotel stay</li>\n<li>Restaurant meals or takeout</li>\n<li>Laundromat visits</li>\n<li>Storage costs</li>\n<li>Transportation fees</li>\n<li>Pet boarding fees</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is vandalized, that’s also covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy. For example, if someone throws a rock through a window or tags your garage door, your policy can help pay to replace the windows and to clean up the graffiti and repaint.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, property can be repaired and replaced.</p>\n<p>To learn more about what homeowners insurance covers, <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">check out this guide</a>.</p>"

      title: "Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Moving?"
      body: "<p>Moving can be a headache, but one thing that makes a move easier? Knowing how your homeowners insurance can protect you along the way.</p>\n<p>So does <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> cover moving? The simple answer is that it does cover your belongings for some losses, but the moving company should have insurance that covers other circumstances. Understanding what is covered and what isn’t helps you better prepare for those potential accidents when getting your stuff from one home to the next.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canhomeownersinsurancecovermybelongingsduringamove\">Can Homeowners Insurance Cover My Belongings During a Move?</h2>\n<p>Yes, for certain losses. Your homeowners insurance policy can cover your belongings in your home and outside the home. In fact, our policies can cover your belongings anywhere in the world. That includes in a storage facility.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance may also cover some sources of loss to your belongings while in transit if you hire professional movers. It really depends on your policy.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that damage from incidents like car accidents or dropping belongings usually isn’t a covered event, though. Standard <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> cover personal property on a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils</a> basis. That means it can cover damage from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge of water or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing of household systems</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these events probably won’t occur during a move and impact your personal belongings. But theft or fire could be a real risk, and in that case, your home insurance would likely cover the event.</p>\n<p>If you have <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property</a>, like jewelry and collectibles, they’re covered for all sources of damage except those listed as exclusions, like wear and tear, insects or vermin, war, and nuclear hazard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesmoversbusinessinsurancecover\">What Does Movers’ Business Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Under federal law, interstate movers are required to offer one of three different liability coverages to customers. It’s not traditional insurance – it covers consumers for damage or breakage of personal items while in the care of the movers.</p>\n<p>Those three liability options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Released value protection:</strong> Gives minimal protection against loss or damage based on the weight of the item. This coverage doesn’t exceed 60 cents per pound per article. It’s usually offered at no additional charge to customers but doesn’t account for the real value of your items.</li>\n<li><strong>Full value protection:</strong> Pays for the <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> (or the current market value) of your belongings if they are lost, destroyed, or otherwise damaged while in the mover’s care. This coverage is more expensive than released value protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Separate liability coverage:</strong> Compliments released value protection by providing coverage for the loss above the released value. This means that the mover is still responsible for the 60 cents per pound, but homeowners are adding policy coverage for the remaining difference in value. Movers will provide homeowners with a written record of the policy at the time it’s purchased.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"readthemoversagreement\">Read the Mover’s Agreement</h2>\n<p>Because movers offer different levels of coverage, it’s essential to talk to the moving company about how your property is covered while in their care.</p>\n<p>Confirm what coverage is available and read the contract to make sure you get what you ask for. Check the contract for any limitations or caps that might be applicable to certain types of items and the timelines for making a claim. You don’t want to miss out on your coverage simply because you missed a filing deadline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectingpropertywhenmovingyourself\">Protecting Property When Moving Yourself</h2>\n<p>When you box up and move yourself, you won’t have the mover’s protection to pay for any losses or damage. You only have your own coverage to count on.</p>\n<p>Call your insurance representative to review your coverage options.

      body: "<p>Dog doors are a great way to give your canine companion some independence – and you a break from having to constantly let them out – by offering Fido the chance to come and go at will. Finding the right doggy door for your home may take a little bit of research, but the effort is worth it once you find one that saves you on energy bills and keeps you and your pets safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readthisbeforeyourbuyadogdoor\">Read This Before Your Buy a Dog Door</h2>\n<p>Choosing a dog door isn’t as simple as picking one out and having it installed. There are a few factors you want to consider first, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost.</strong> We found dog doors for as little as $65, as well as some that cost nearly $2,000. Oddly enough, the high-tech kinds that include a sensor for your dog’s collar weren’t the most expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Size.</strong> Pet doors usually come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. Pick one that allows your dog to move through it comfortably.</li>\n<li><strong>Security.</strong> If you have a large dog, like an Irish wolfhound or a Great Dane, you may end up with a pet door that a person can fit through. Plus, it’s not just potential criminals you need to consider. Small children getting out are also a concern.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy efficiency.</strong> A poorly designed or installed doggy door can cause your energy bills to go up.</li>\n<li><strong>Installation.</strong> While there are many pet doors you can install on your own, others require the help of a professional.</li>\n<li><strong>Location.</strong> You want to make sure your dog or cat can exit your home and enter a safe location, like an enclosed patio or your backyard. This may mean you want to evaluate your fence. Not only do <a href=\"/blog/good-fences-make-good-neighbors/\">good fences make good neighbors</a>, but they keep your pets safe, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing you probably won’t have to worry about is your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. As long as your pet door is properly installed and well maintained, then it shouldn’t cause you any headaches when looking for coverage – at least, not with us!</p>\n<h2 id=\"5typesofdogdoors\">5 Types of Dog Doors</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, a dog door was simply a space covered by a flap that let your dog nose its way out of your home. Now you have lots of different options to choose from that we’ve grouped into five categories. Keep in mind that within these groupings, you’ll likely find any number of materials and styles to fit your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"energyefficientpetdoors\">Energy-Efficient Pet Doors</h3>\n<p>Some dog doors have lightweight vinyl flaps that can become warped or bent, which may mean they’ll do a lousy job of keeping out the cold and wet. The better idea is to find an energy-efficient option to minimize energy loss. For example, a two-flap system is usually more energy efficient than the traditional single-flap entry.</p>\n<p>Most energy-efficient systems also have weatherstripping or an air-tight seal, and many use magnets to help keep the door closed when it isn’t in use. Not only does this help with your energy consumption in the home, but it can also reduce the number of unwanted insects coming in because there aren’t any gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doormounteddoggydoors\">Door-Mounted Doggy Doors</h3>\n<p>Door-mounted pet doors are what probably first comes to mind when people think about doggy doors. They commonly have a plastic or aluminum frame and a flap for your pet to push when it wants to be outside. Some have two or three flaps to improve energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>Door-mounted doggy doors are usually fairly easy to install and for your dog to use. Unfortunately, that means other animals (or worse) may also be able to use it, so you want to look for door-mounted dog doors that have some way of securing the flap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallmounteddogdoors\">Wall-Mounted Dog Doors</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a wall-mounted pet door is situated on the wall of your house rather than in a door. This may mean you install it in a hole drilled into the wall or you may end up with a tunnel running from the inside to the outside. Both can be tricky to install yourself, and you may have to patch the wall if you ever decide to move.</p>\n<p>Most wall-mounted dog doors come with sealed seams and are weatherproof, features that definitely fall in the plus column. The other big draw for wall-mounted pet doors is that they can be placed in less noticeable locations. That’s good for both curb appeal and security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"slidingglassdoorinserts\">Sliding Glass Door Inserts</h3>\n<p>A sliding glass door insert is a panel that sits on your existing door track and has a dog door pre-installed at the bottom. You place the insert on the tracks, keeping your sliding glass door partially open, and lock it into place. This allows you to use your door as you normally would.</p>\n<p>This may be the easiest type of pet door to install, so it’s often less expensive than some of the other options on our list. It’s also a great idea for renters because installation doesn’t require you to cut or drill holes in your unit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hightechandelectronicpetdoors\">High-Tech and Electronic Pet Doors</h3>\n<p>All of the doggy doors on our list are manually operated by your pet – usually, with just a push of its snout. However, there are also high-tech and electronic pet doors that are ideal for people concerned about security.</p>\n<p>For example, some electronic dog doors only open when your dog is near by reacting to a chip on your dog’s collar. Others have timers that automatically open and close the door. This helps keep out unwanted intruders of both the animal and human varieties.</p>\n<p>We know you want to keep your animal companions as secure as possible.

      title: "Escrow and home insurance: What you need to know"
      body: "<p>Let’s say you’re buying a home when your lender tells you that you need an escrow account. Would you know what that is and why you need it?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry. Escrow accounts are a fairly common practice when making a home purchase. They can even make your life easier when it comes to paying many of the extra expenses that come with buying a home. Let’s take a closer look at how escrow, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, and other costs work together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanescrowaccount\">What is an escrow account?</h2>\n<p>An escrow account is a reserve where money is held during a real estate transaction until certain requirements are met. Typically, a third party, like an escrow company or a mortgage servicer, serves as a go-between and manages the account.</p>\n<p>You may need an escrow account when <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house\">buying a house</a> to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect good faith money, ensuring it’s released to the seller of the home when the contractual terms are met.</li>\n<li>Hold on to funds you can use to pay your home insurance and property tax.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesanescrowaccountwork\">How does an escrow account work?</h2>\n<p>Escrow accounts are really not that complex in nature – they’re essentially holding accounts. Your money sits in escrow until you’ve either met the terms of a contract or your mortgage servicer needs it to pay bills.</p>\n<p>Take the first example. In that scenario, you put your deposit in an escrow account to show that you’re serious about buying the home. The seller gets to keep that money if you back out, but it goes to your down payment if the sale goes through as planned.</p>\n<p>In the second example, your mortgage company has established an escrow account after you purchased a home. It then puts some of your monthly mortgage payment into the account until your property taxes and home insurance premiums are due. When you have this type of escrow account, you make one payment for your mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, and the escrow company pays the appropriate party as required.</p>\n<p>You should note that escrow accounts usually don’t earn interest. As a result, you want to think carefully about whether using escrow to pay home insurance is a good idea for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesescrowpayhomeinsurance\">Does escrow pay home insurance?</h2>\n<p>If you have an escrow account, you likely pay your home insurance bill through it. This usually means you pay a portion of your insurance premium every month with your mortgage payment so that there’s money in the escrow account when the annual premium is due. Basically, you’re prepaying your home insurance bill.</p>\n<p>Lenders like using escrow accounts because they reduce the risk of a homeowner defaulting on a home because they either forgot to pay or didn’t save money for their home insurance or property taxes.</p>\n<p>Lenders contractually require homeowners to keep valid home insurance. This protects the lender’s financial interest in a home because they know it can be rebuilt and retain its <a href=\"/glossary/market-value-of-home/\">market value</a> if there’s a major loss. Lenders have a similar interest in making sure homeowners pay their property taxes. A city may be able to foreclose on properties delinquent in taxes. Requiring property taxes be paid through an escrow account reduces this risk, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doihavetopayhomeownersinsurancethroughescrow\">Do I have to pay homeowners insurance through escrow?</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you use escrow to pay home insurance depends on the contract you signed with your lender. If your lender requires an escrow account, then you most likely have to pay your insurance through it. If your lender does not require an escrow account, then you can choose to pay insurance through an escrow account or directly to your homeowners insurance company.</p>\n<p>Even if your mortgage servicer requires you to set up a home insurance escrow account, you get to decide who you want to insure your home. You still need to pick a company that meets your lender’s requirements, but other than that, the choice is yours.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, you can shop around for a new insurance company even if your escrow account has already been set up. When you do this, you send the new insurance information to the lender, who changes the insurance company. This may require a down payment and some escrow adjustments to ensure you have sufficient funds, but you might also receive a prorated refund from your former insurance company.</p>\n<p>Get more detailed information in our article <a href=\"/blog/change-homeowners-insurance-with-escrow/\"><em>How to change homeowners insurance with an escrow account</em></a>.</p>"

      title: "Money matters: Factors affecting mortgage affordability"
      body: "<p>Making sure you can afford your mortgage payments is just as crucial as finding a home you and your family will love – if not more so! The size of your loan is a big part of your total cost of ownership, but so is the mortgage rate you lock in, as well as other house costs like property taxes and insurance. Plus you may have additional homeowners fees and private mortgage insurance premiums to pay.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at several factors that can impact mortgage affordability, starting with the 28/36 rule for how much debt you should have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthe2836rule\">What is the 28/36 rule?</h2>\n<p>The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/28-36-rule-mortgages\" text=\"28/36 rule\" >}} is a formula for determining how much debt an individual or household should take on. Basically, it states that a household should spend no more than 28% of its gross monthly income on total housing costs and 36% on debt, like credit card and auto loan payments.</p>\n<p>Lenders frequently use the 28/36 rule to decide whether or not to offer borrowers credit. The idea is that debt loads higher than the 28/36 limits will likely be difficult for a person or household to sustain and may eventually result in default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesthe2836ruleimpactyourhomebuyingbudget\">How does the 28/36 rule impact your home buying budget?</h3>\n<p>Most traditional lenders set a maximum household expense-to-income ratio of 28% and a maximum overall {{< external-link url=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\" text=\"debt-to-income ratio\" >}} of 36% when using the 28/36 rule to evaluate your creditworthiness. To do this, they may ask about housing costs and comprehensive debt accounts in the credit application.</p>\n<p>Each lender creates their own standards for housing debt and total debt as part of its underwriting program. But the general idea is that the borrower’s living expenses (e.g., rent, mortgage payments) are at most 28% of their monthly or yearly income. The borrower’s entire debt obligation can’t be higher than 36% of income.</p>\n<p>For example, let's assume that a person earns $5,000 monthly. If that person follows the 28/36 rule, they might set aside $1,000 monthly for their housing costs and mortgage payment. This would leave an additional $800 available for paying back other kinds of loans.</p>\n<p>An easy tip to reduce the debt-to-income ratio is to consolidate multiple debts and clear your financial obligations before applying for a mortgage. When you {{< external-link url=\"https://www.ovlg.com/debt-consolidation/\" text=\"consolidate multiple debts\" >}} through a debt consolidation program, your monthly payments get reduced, and it becomes easier for you to get out of debt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisacreditscore\">What is a credit score?</h2>\n<p>Credit scores are three digit numbers that were created to help companies predict the credit behavior of businesses and individuals. The companies that develop credit scores typically look at factors such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-time payment history.</li>\n<li>Amount of unpaid debt.</li>\n<li>Amount of available credit being used.</li>\n<li>Number and type of open loan accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesyourcreditscoreimpactyourhomebuyingbudget\">How does your credit score impact your home buying budget?</h3>\n<p>Mortgage lenders also look at your credit score and credit report when deciding whether you qualify and when calculating your interest rate. They have several different credit scores to choose from, but lenders are more likely to use your FICOⓇ Score.</p>\n<p>The general rule is that a better credit score gets you a lower interest rate. Many mortgage lenders will only pay attention to your application if your score is at least 620. Even when the down payment is just 3% to 5% of the purchase price, a borrower with excellent credit is given the best terms. A borrower with a 3% down payment and a bad credit score (659 or lower), on the other hand, pays more throughout the life of the loan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creditscorerange\">Credit Score range</h3>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"creditscorerange-1\">Credit score range</h3>\n<p>| Range | Remarks |\n| --- | --- |\n| 800-850 | Excellent |\n| 740-799 | Very good |\n| 670-739 | Good |\n| 580-669 | Fair |\n| 300-579 | Poor |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p>It is legally feasible to get a loan from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with a 500 credit score. However, you’ll probably have to meet other {{< external-link url=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/home-loans/i/fha-home-loan-requirements\" text=\"requirements\" >}}, such as having:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Social Security number.</li>\n<li>No bankruptcies for the past two years.</li>\n<li>No short sales, foreclosures, or deeds in lieu of foreclosures for the past three years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional criteria may apply, and you should note that you may end up paying a lot more money then you would with a different type of loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatotherfactorsinfluencehowmuchhouseyoucanafford\">What other factors influence how much house you can afford?</h2>\n<p>How much house you can afford is determined partly by your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly income.</li>\n<li>Cash reserves for a down payment and closing costs.</li>\n<li>Monthly expenses.</li>\n<li>Credit history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These all influence your budget and how much of a down payment you can make. Your down payment varies based on the type of loan you take out, and it plays a significant role in determining your mortgage affordability.</p>\n<p>A larger down payment can result in a lower interest rate and more rapid home equity growth. On the other hand, a lower down payment can mean you end up with higher costs overall.</p>\n<p>For example, you may be required to pay for <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) if your down payment is less than 20 on a traditional loan. That can increase your monthly mortgage payment by the annual cost of PMI – usually around 1% of your outstanding loan balance. Once your remaining balance reaches 80% of the initial loan amount, you can ask to have PMI removed.</p>\n<p>That said, there are ways to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">buy a home for no money down</a>. Both the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Agriculture have loan programs that don’t require a down payment. Plus, there are loans that only ask for 3% to 5%, like an FHA loan that needs just a 3.5%.</p>\n<p>Other factors that influence your house buying budget are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest rates.</strong> The interest rate imposed on your mortgage affects its affordability. More often than not, homebuyers with high credit scores qualify for cheap <a href=\"/blog/how-does-mortgage-interest-work/\">mortgage interest rates</a>, though lenders also consider your income and other loans.</li>\n<li><strong>Property taxes.</strong> Buying a home means taking on the associated tax obligations, so you want to account for property taxes in addition to your mortgage payment. That bill can be very different depending on the value and location of your property.</li>\n<li><strong>Homeowners insurance.</strong> Getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> protects you from financial losses should you experience a catastrophe. <a href=\"/blog/11-factors-impacting-home-insurance-premium/\">Several factors impact premium</a>, but the average is just over $1,200 per year.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing costs.</strong> Closing is the last step in buying a home, and there are usually <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">closing costs</a> that must be paid at that time. These can range from 2% to 5% of the price of the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, you want to think carefully about how much house you can afford. If you base your decision solely on how much you want to spend each month on your mortgage payments, you may end up short.</p>\n<p>Instead, look at your whole financial situation. That starts with whether or not you can afford a mortgage as well as the other costs that come with homeownership. After you've done all of that, it's time to start looking for the perfect home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheauthor\">About the author</h3>\n<p>Lyle Solomon has extensive legal experience, in-depth knowledge, and experience in consumer finance and writing.

      title: "FHA Loan Requirements for New Homeowners"
      body: "<p>One of the biggest barriers to buying a house for most first-time buyers is coming up with the down payment. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was founded in 1934 to help solve that problem.</p>\n<p>The FHA insures mortgages offered by partner banks to make it easier for first-time homebuyers to buy a house. Homebuyers can put down much less for the home than they would with a conventional mortgage, and the FHA mortgage insurance protects lenders if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage. It’s less risk for the lender and less barrier-to-entry for first-time buyers.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, the FHA has <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/fhahistory\">insured more than 46 million mortgages</a>. While the FHA loan makes homeownership easy, it still has some of its own requirements for down payments, credit scores, debt-to-income ratio, private mortgage insurance, and inspections. Let’s dig in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsfordownpaymentcreditscore\">FHA Loan Requirements for Down Payment &amp; Credit Score</h2>\n<p>No matter the <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">type of mortgage</a> you choose, credit scores are a big factor in your eligibility. The same goes for an FHA loan.</p>\n<p>Your credit score often determines the cost of the down payment. With conventional mortgages, the lender usually requires a 620 FICO score with 20 percent down payment – much higher than the FHA loan requires.</p>\n<p>An FHA loan has a minimum credit score of 500. If your credit score is between 500 and 579, the FHA requires a 10 percent down payment. If your credit score is 580 or higher, you only need to come up with 3.5 percent down. Put another way, that’s only $3,500 for every $100,000 borrowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsfordebttoincomeratio\">FHA Loan Requirements for Debt-to-Income Ratio</h2>\n<p>Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is the percentage of your monthly gross income used to pay for monthly expenses. Lenders look at two DTI ratios: total debt and mortgage debt. Lenders use maximum ratios to ensure borrowers have enough monthly income to pay all debts – particularly the home loan.</p>\n<p>An FHA loan is more generous than some other home loans when it comes to the maximum DTI. The FHA sets the limit at 43/31. The first number refers to your total monthly debt. That means that when you add up all your monthly expenses – mortgage, car payment, credit cards, student loans – it can’t exceed 43 percent of your monthly income. The second number is the maximum amount the mortgage can be of your monthly income – not more than 31 percent.</p>\n<p>For example, if you make $5,000 per month, you can’t have more than $2,150 going toward debt each month. The maximum mortgage payment caps at $1,550 per month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsforprivatemortgageinsurance\">FHA Loan Requirements for Private Mortgage Insurance</h2>\n<p>Private <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>, or PMI, is a type of insurance that protects lenders if a homeowners defaults on the loan. It’s required when you put less than 20 percent down on a home. Don’t confuse it with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, which protects the home against physical damage.</p>\n<p>With an FHA loan, homebuyers are required to have mortgage insurance and pay what is called upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP). The upfront amount is 1.75 percent of the loan amount paid at closing. It can also be rolled into the mortgage.</p>\n<p>The monthly mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is between 0.45 and 1.05 percent of the loan amount. The variation depends on the loan down payment and term. You pay the MIP for the life of the FHA loan if you put down less than 10 percent. If you put down 10 percent or more, you pay mortgage insurance premiums for 11 years.</p>\n<p>In either case, you can get PMI removed by refinancing to a non-FHA loan. Learn more about <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-options/\">refinancing options</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsforhomeasprimaryresidence\">FHA Loan Requirements for Home As Primary Residence</h2>\n<p>An FHA loan is designed to help people become homeowners, not investors. That’s why the FHA requires that the home must be the buyer’s primary residence. In other words, you have to live in the home you’re buying with an FHA loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrequirementsforinspectionsandappraisals\">FHA Loan Requirements for Inspections and Appraisals</h2>\n<p>All new home purchases with an FHA loan must meet minimum property requirements established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The <a href=\"/blog/when-to-walk-away-after-a-home-inspection/\">inspection report</a> must prove the home is safe, sound, and secure.</p>\n<p>While most homebuyers use the inspection report to negotiate for repairs or credits, the FHA looks at the report to make sure the home meets minimum HUD requirements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/4000.1hsgh.pdf\">HUD’s Single-Family Policy Handbook</a> has a complete list of the requirements, but the property must have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structurally sound foundation.</li>\n<li>Water drainage away from the home.</li>\n<li>Functioning utilities.</li>\n<li>Functioning appliances.</li>\n<li>Hot and cold water with adequate water pressure.</li>\n<li>No chipping or peeling paint.</li>\n<li>Properly functioning electrical outlets and switches.</li>\n<li>Windows that can open, close, and lock.</li>\n<li>No roof leaks and a roof with at least two years life remaining.</li>\n<li>Ventilated and damage-free attics and crawl spaces.</li>\n<li>No active termite infestation.</li>\n<li>No environmental hazards, unreasonable odors, or excessive noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An FHA loan can be denied if the property doesn’t meet these requirements. The inspection and the appraisal may happen at different times. While the inspection looks at the function of things in and around the house, the appraisal considers market value compared with other homes in the area.</p>\n<p>The appraisal must meet or exceed the amount of the loan. If your appraisal comes in under the loan value, the loan will either not be approved or you will have to come up with cash to make up for the difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finalnoteonfhaloanrequirements\">Final Note on FHA Loan Requirements</h2>\n<p>The FHA loan makes it easier for many new homeowners to afford a property, but it’s not without its requirements. Be sure to compare different types of mortgages to make sure you get the loan that’s right for your needs. But don’t be afraid to explore the FHA – it can be a great way to enter the world of homeownership sooner than you may have expected.</p>"

      title: "Financial Ratings: What They Are and Why They Matter"
      body: "<p>The tricky thing about homeowners insurance is that it’s all about trust. You don’t get a physical product, so you have to believe that your insurance company will be able to meet its obligations to you should you file a claim. This is why financial ratings are so important to insurance providers and policyholders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarefinancialstrengthratings\">What Are Financial Strength Ratings?</h2>\n<p>Financial ratings, sometimes called financial strength ratings or FSRs, are scores that help consumers know if an insurance company is financially healthy. They were created by independent ratings companies to indicate if an insurer can pay claims, especially in a catastrophic scenario.</p>\n<h2 id=\"independentfinancialratingcompaniesforhomeinsurers\">Independent Financial Rating Companies for Home Insurers</h2>\n<p>Six different companies rate home insurance companies, and each one has a unique way of evaluating financial strength::</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AM Best.</li>\n<li>Demotech, Inc.</li>\n<li>Fitch.</li>\n<li>Standard &amp; Poor’s Insurance Rating Services.</li>\n<li>Moody’s.</li>\n<li>Kroll Bond Rating Agency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best known of these rating companies is probably AM Best.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfactorsdofinancialratingcompanieslookat\">What Factors Do Financial Rating Companies Look At?</h2>\n<p>The independent rating agencies look at a company's records and financial statements to determine its FSR. Depending on the rating company, these statements might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balance sheets.</li>\n<li>Reports filed with regulators.</li>\n<li>Economic and industry reports.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">Reinsurance</a> information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demotech, Inc is unique among these financial rating companies in that it can evaluate new insurance companies. Newer insurance companies like Kin don’t have as much historical information, so Demotech, Inc focuses on pro forma financial statements, or statements that forecast future periods, for new insurers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagoodfinancialratingforhomeinsurance\">What Is a Good Financial Rating for Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>When you’re looking for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, you want to look for a company with a high rating. In fact, your insurance company’s <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">financial strength</a> is so important that your mortgage lender most likely requires your insurer to have achieved a certain rating. This generally means sticking to companies with an A grade because that indicates a company is in good financial standing with the capacity to handle catastrophic <a href=\"/claims/\">claims</a> scenarios.</p>\n<p>We’ve gathered the financial rating scales for the six independent ratings agencies and listed them below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambestfinancialratingscale\">AM Best Financial Rating Scale</h3>\n<p>| Rating Symbol | Rating Category |\n| --- | --- |\n| A+ | Superior |\n| A | Excellent |\n| B+ | Good |\n| B | Fair |\n| C+ | Marginal |\n| C | Weak |\n| D | Poor |</p>\n<h3 id=\"demotechincfinancialstabilityratings\">Demotech, Inc.

Many insurance companies like to get rated by AM Best because it’s a large, well-known rating agency that has been around a long time and focuses solely on insurance. But its rating method favors older, more established insurers.</p>\n<p>Other financial rating companies may not have been around as long as AM Best, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t as good. Demotech, for example, had its methodology reviewed and accepted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1990, just five years after it started.</p>\n<p>All in all, the six ratings companies have solid reputations for accurately reflecting an insurance company’s ability to pay claims and handle debts. Just remember that ratings can change, so you want to know what an insurance company’s rating is before you buy or renew a policy.</p>"

      title: "Finding air leaks in houses: DIY methods | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>Air leaks in your home don’t just leave you with an uncomfortable draft. They lead to higher energy consumption and a bigger carbon footprint. Finding air leaks in the house enables you to close them up and make your heating and cooling systems more efficient.</p>\n<p>But these leaks aren’t always obvious. In fact, they can be surprisingly sneaky and nearly invisible to the naked eye. Leaks usually come through cracks and openings in your doors and windows, but even your electrical outlets and floorboards could be sources of excessive air leaking.</p>\n<p>So how can you get rid of them? In this guide, we’ll explore some of the most common sources of air leakage and discuss how to find air leaks in a house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyitsimportanttofixairleaks\">Why it’s important to fix air leaks</h2>\n<p>Did you know that air leaks inside your home could result in you using {{< external-link url=\"https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec479.pdf\" text=\"up to 30% more energy\" >}}? This not only translates to higher utility bills, but air leaking also means your HVAC system is working harder to maintain a comfortable temperature. The harder it works, the more likely your systems will eventually experience maintenance problems and potentially reduce the overall lifespan of the system.</p>\n<p>Knowing how to find where cold air is coming in not only allows you to maintain your HVAC system and a comfortable temperature — it can also improve the air quality in your home, keeping you and your family safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonsourcesofairleakage\">Common sources of air leakage</h2>\n<p>The key to knowing how to detect air leaks in houses is knowing where to look. Here are some of the areas you should check first yo find air leaks in a house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attic hatch</li>\n<li>Piping</li>\n<li>Wires</li>\n<li>Plumbing vents</li>\n<li>The tops of your basement’s walls</li>\n<li>Chimneys</li>\n<li>Recessed lighting</li>\n<li>Windows</li>\n<li>Doors</li>\n<li>Ductwork</li>\n<li>Baseboards</li>\n<li>Garages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hate to break it to you, but this is only a short list of where those leaks might be coming from. You could patch up one air leak and not realize there are five others in the same area! That’s why calling in a professional is best — they’re trained in how to find air leaks in houses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofindairleaksiniourhouse6ways\">How to find air leaks in iour house: 6 Ways</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to check for air leaks in houses might feel overwhelming, but there are a few methods you can try that may help you find leaks so you can air seal your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visualinspection\">Visual inspection</h3>\n<p>Weatherstripping and caulking eventually wears away, and it’s considered good practice to check your existing insulation visually. Take a look at the areas outside and inside your home for any cracks or gaps. You can also place your hand next to any suspected areas to detect a temperature change or air flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Visual inspections may help you find some leaks, but this method isn’t always reliable. You’d be surprised how many leaks aren’t visible to the eye.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingpressurizationtest\">Building pressurization test</h3>\n<p>If a visual inspection doesn’t turn up any leaks, try conducting a building pressurization test. First, you’ll need to wait for a windy day. Once you get one, you can follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off any combustible appliances, heaters, water heaters, and furnaces.</li>\n<li>Close all the doors, windows, and any fireplace flues.</li>\n<li>Turn on the exhaust fans inside your house. (You can also use a large window fan to remove the air from your home.)</li>\n<li>Light an incense stick and move it toward suspected areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the smoke is sucked out or blown into the room, you’ve found your leak.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can do this at home without the help of a professional, but it’s important to proceed carefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"airleakdetectors\">Air leak detectors</h3>\n<p>Air leak detectors are used to — you guessed it! — detect air leaks. The most common type of detector is the smoke pencil air leak detector. These detectors will produce smoke so that you can easily see where the air is going. Similar to the pressurization test, you've found a leak if air is blown into the room or sucked out.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the budget, consider investing in an ultrasonic air leak detector. An ultrasonic air leak detector uses ultrasound waves to identify leaks. These are among the most accurate home leak detectors available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theflashlightmethod\">The flashlight method</h3>\n<p>The flashlight method is designed to catch larger leaks in windows and doors. Grab a flashlight (or use your smartphone) and wait until it’s dark outside. Turn out the lights in your home and shine a flashlight anywhere you think there might be a gap or a crack. Ask someone to stand on the other side. If they can see any rays of light coming through, you’ve found your leak.</p>\n<p>Note: The downside to the flashlight method is it’s only effective for larger cracks. However, as rudimentary as this method is, it’s still a highly effective way of finding sources of air leakage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dirtyatticinsulation\">Dirty attic insulation</h3>\n<p>Attics are one of the most common culprits when it comes to air leaks. They can also hurt the air quality of your home because attics are regularly filled with dust. This type of leak is typically a bit easier to diagnose — it’s hard to ignore dusty air flying around the home.</p>\n<p>Performing this test is essentially the same as doing a visual inspection. Check to see if your attic insulation has darkened, caused by dusty air coming in through cracks in your attic. You might even notice frosty areas on your insulation if warm air has come into contact with cold air in your attic. Not only is this one of the best tips for how to find cold air leaks in houses, but it may also help you prevent mold.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the winter, you’ll often find “frosty” areas in your attic because the warm air from downstairs is condensing and freezing when it reaches the cold air in your attic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blowerdoortest\">Blower door test</h3>\n<p>Professionals often use the blower door test. During this process, they seal an entire property and blow a depressurization fan through it. It’s typically installed within the doorway, creating a low-pressure wave indoors. This forces air through any leaks and cracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ordering a professional blower door test is one of the best ways to find those hidden areas that need to be insulated. While there are DIY methods, calling in experts is often your best choice..</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourhomewithkininsurance\">Protect your home with Kin Insurance</h2>\n<p>Air leaks can do real damage to a home’s heating and cooling systems, and HVAC repairs can put a major dent in your bank account.

      title: "First Time Home Buyer Tips"
      body: "<p>Looking to buy your first home? It's a huge milestone – and one that takes careful planning. These first time home buyer tips can help you achieve your goal of homeownership faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startsavingnow\">Start Saving Now</h2>\n<p>When you buy a home, you generally have to come up with a sizable down payment. This can range anywhere from three to 20 percent of the cost of the home. To put that amount in perspective, for every $100,000 of home you purchase, you need anywhere from $3,000 to $20,000 for your down payment.</p>\n<p>This can be one of the biggest obstacles to buying a new home. If you can’t save that much in the timeframe you’re looking to buy, and you don’t qualify for a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">zero-down loan program</a>, you may have to look at other options, like getting a gift from your parents or tapping into your 401(k). Either way, make sure you’re prepared for the down payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decidewhatyourbudgetis\">Decide What Your Budget Is</h2>\n<p>It’s one thing to peruse the pages of Zillow and fantasize about the home you’ll buy, and another thing altogether to know which homes you can afford. Use one of the many online mortgage calculators that estimate your monthly mortgage payment based on the cost of the home, downpayment, and interest rates.</p>\n<p>Once you have an idea of how much your mortgage might be, you can get a better handle on the types of homes you might actually be able to buy. This makes your search much more focused and can help you make decisions further on down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raiseyourcreditscore\">Raise Your Credit Score</h2>\n<p>Most lenders prefer credit scores of 680 or higher, but the Federal Housing Administration accepts credit scores as low as 500 if you can put 10 percent down. If your credit is less than perfect, you want to work on improving it now. This may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dealing with late payments or delinquencies.</li>\n<li>Disputing errors.</li>\n<li>Paying down debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only does your credit score determine your ability to qualify for a loan, but it also determines the rate of the loan. Basically, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate is. That’s important because better rates can save you thousands in interest over the course of the loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"researchyourmortgageoptions\">Research Your Mortgage Options</h2>\n<p>Learn what types of <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage options</a> there are and decide which is the best option for you. One place to look is towards the federal governments. It’s home loan programs are usually designed with first time home buyers in mind, including programs from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Housing Administration.</li>\n<li>US Department of Veterans Affairs.</li>\n<li>US Department of Agriculture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These loan programs generally have lower credit and down payment requirements. However, if you have great credit and enough for a 20 percent down payment, you might find your best rates in conventional mortgages. Knowing what you are most likely to qualify for can help you best plan for your new home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findarealtor\">Find a Realtor</h2>\n<p>Even if you aren’t ready to buy just yet, you may want to develop a relationship with a realtor that you trust. They can help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand different market conditions that suggest good times to buy.</li>\n<li>Point you in the right direction for neighborhoods to consider.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for your perfect home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to be able to trust that your realtor has your best interests in mind. Get to know them before you shop in earnest to get a sense of how a working relationship might go.</p>\n<p>For more pointers, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">22 Questions to Ask When Buying a House</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"researchneighborhoods\">Research Neighborhoods</h2>\n<p>While your realtor points you in the direction of neighborhoods and homes that fit your needs, it’s best to do your own due diligence. Depending on your top concerns, you probably want to look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Area schools.</li>\n<li>Crime.</li>\n<li>Local eateries.</li>\n<li>Parks.</li>\n<li>Distance from your work or school.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When researching neighborhoods, you need to determine where you feel safe, how conducive the area is to your lifestyle, and whether it fits your work needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getapreapprovalletter\">Get a Pre-Approval Letter</h2>\n<p>Many agree that before you even start shopping for a new home, you should talk to a mortgage broker and get your loan pre-approved. The pre-approval letter makes you a better prospect as a buyer because sellers know you’re serious and can meet the loan requirements. Some won’t even accept an offer without a pre-approval letter.</p>\n<p>This is different from using online loan calculators. While those can get thinking about a budget, a pre-approval letter defines it because the lender factors in your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal credit.</li>\n<li>Debt-to-income ratio.</li>\n<li>Income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this helps determine the top end of what you can afford. Plus, it doesn’t commit you to a particular lender or loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planforclosingcosts\">Plan for Closing Costs</h2>\n<p>We’ve already talked about the down payment, but you also need to save money for the <a href=\"/glossary/closing-costs/\">closing costs</a>. These can be anywhere from two to five percent of the purchase price and includes fees like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li>Title insurance.</li>\n<li>Appraisals.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes you can roll some or all of your closing costs into the final loan balance. While it’s nice to not have to come up with the extra cash, you should run the numbers to see how much this may cost you in additional interest. In most cases, you’re better off paying these costs at closing if you can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"budgetforhomeownersinsurance\">Budget for Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Depending on how far along you are in your home buying journey, you may have already realized that you need to factor the <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a> into your play. Mortgage lenders usually require you to get a policy before they offer a loan.</p>\n<p>In many cases, you can have your homeowners insurance premium paid from an escrow account that holds the balance until the renewals take place. Whether or not you choose to do this, make sure you shop around to get the best rate to keep your monthly costs down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnabouthomeownerstaxbreaks\">Learn About Homeowners Tax Breaks</h2>\n<p>Homeownership entitles you to some <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">tax breaks</a> you'll want to explore. For example, you can deduct your property taxes as well as the interest you pay on the mortgage. Closing costs may also be tax deductible, but you should talk to a tax adviser to determine which are – if any. Making the most of tax breaks can help homeowners pay for repairs and upkeep.</p>\n<p>Planning ahead is essential to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">making homeownership affordable</a>. Get your finances in order now, and you could be a first-time homeowner sooner than you think.</p>"

      body: "<p>In every life, a little rain must fall. But when a light drizzle turns into a deluge, then you may be at risk for flash flooding. These dangerous weather events often catch people unprepared – in part because flash floods move so quickly, but also because they can start some distance away from your location.</p>\n<p>Understanding what flash flooding is and what to do if your area is threatened by one is important for keeping your family safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisflashflooding\">What is flash flooding?</h2>\n<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) {{< external-link url=\"https://www.weather.gov/phi/FlashFloodingDefinition\" text=\"defines flash flooding\" >}} as a flood that begins within six hours of a heavy rainstorm. However, the NWS also claims that flash floods can occur within three hours of a storm or other cause.</p>\n<p>That’s an important distinction to note. While flash floods are most commonly associated with heavy rain and slow-moving thunderstorms, they might also happen if a dam, levee, or even an ice jam breaks.</p>\n<p>Whatever the cause, flash flooding can do considerable damage. Fast rising floodwaters have moved boulders, knocked down bridges, and destroyed homes. Even a foot of water can be strong enough to float most cars. Add another foot, and you may see a truck or two floating by.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheredoflashfloodsoccur\">Where do flash floods occur?</h2>\n<p>If you take away anything from this article, let it be this: flash floods can happen anywhere. For instance, a thunderstorm may cause a river to overflow, putting downstream homes at risk. But debris could just as easily dam up the same river and cause flooding upstream.</p>\n<p>That said, certain areas are more prone to flash floods. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Areas near rivers and other bodies of water.</li>\n<li>Mountains where steep slopes may cause rapid runoff.</li>\n<li>Densely populated places where construction limits the amount of water the ground can absorb.</li>\n<li>Coastal areas where hurricanes are common.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another area with flash flood risk are places near dams and levees that may break or overflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoknowifaflashfloodiscoming\">How to know if a flash flood Is coming</h2>\n<p>In some cities, you can sign up to have emergency alerts sent to your cell phone to notify you of possible threats so you can take appropriate action. These typically include flood advisories, watches, and warnings as well as flash flood warning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodadvisory\">What is a flood advisory?</h3>\n<p>A flood advisory is a notification sent to residents by local authorities that raises the concern of flooding. Typically, indicates that the current weather situation may cause flooding that could result in significant inconvenience and dangerous conditions if people are not careful. Advisories can escalate to a watch or warning if conditions worsen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodwatch\">What is a flood watch?</h3>\n<p>A flood watch usually means the local authorities believe weather conditions favor flooding This may mean they’ve seen an extreme flow of water into a dry area or rapidly rising levels in nearby bodies of water. A watch usually doesn’t mean that a flood will happen, but people should prepare for that possibility. Moreover, residents are urged to pay attention to flood watches because they’re often a precursor to a flash flood warning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisafloodwarning\">What is a flood warning?</h3>\n<p>A flood warning indicates that a flood has already occurred or is very likely to occur. People in low-lying areas need to move to higher ground and should listen for information about <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">mandatory evacuations</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisaflashfloodwarning\">What is a flash flood warning?</h3>\n<p>A flash flood warning is the most serious flood alert authorities can usually give. This warning indicates that either enough rain has fallen for a flash flood to occur or flash flooding has already happened in the area. As with a flood warning, people in low areas may need to evacuate.</p>\n<p>If your area doesn’t have an emergency alert system, then you want to tune into your local radio or television stations to find out exactly what the threat is and what you should do. These broadcast centers will have the most up-to-date information about the weather conditions to help keep you safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoinaflashflood\">What to do in a flash flood</h2>\n<p>The key to keeping your family safe in an emergency is to plan ahead. For example, you may want to make a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> that includes steps like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting together a disaster supply kit.</li>\n<li>Knowing where shelters are and the routes to get to them.</li>\n<li>Having a contact list handy.</li>\n<li>Practicing your plan with your family.</li>\n<li>Moving electronics to upper floors in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a flash flood, you may need to head for higher ground, so be sure you’ve identified spots that fit that description.</p>\n<p>In addition to planning ahead, you want to pay attention to what’s happening around you. Keep an eye out for rapidly rising water and leave your radio or television tuned to the news. If you do encounter water, be cautious. Floodwaters are not just muddy, which means you can’t know what’s in it, but they’re often contaminated so keep your children and pets out of it. Heed the advice from the NWS to “Turn around, don’t drown.”</p>\n<p>One more note about preparing for a flash flood: <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> generally doesn’t not cover flood damage. So the final step to protecting your home and family is to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>"

      title: "Flood insurance is for everyone"
      body: "<p>Most homeowners don’t have flood insurance. Part of that problem is misconception: many homeowners don’t realize their home insurance policy excludes flood coverage. For others, they aren’t required by federally regulated lenders to carry it, so they don’t.</p>\n<p>But the reason most people don’t have <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>? They drastically underestimate their own risk of flooding – to their detriment.</p>\n<p>So let us be the first to address the question, “Do I need flood insurance?”</p>\n<p>Everyone needs flood insurance. And this is why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"astandardhomeinsurancepolicyisntenough\">A standard home insurance policy isn’t enough</h2>\n<p>A basic <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> can cover <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">some types of water damage</a>, but it doesn’t cover flood damage caused by storm surge. You have to add flood insurance to your coverage or purchase it as a separate policy. Unfortunately, many homeowners think homeowners insurance covers flood damage.</p>\n<p>And that misconception has consequences. According to a 2020 poll by the Insurance Information Institute, only {{< external-link url=\"https://www.iii.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/2020<em>triple-i</em>consumer<em>poll</em>091620.pdf\" text=\"27% of American homeowners have flood insurance\" >}}.</p>\n<p>More disconcerting is that the coastal homeowners who arguably need flood protection the most also lack protection. In 2017, McKinsey &amp; Company found {{< external-link url=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insuring-hurricanes-perspectives-gaps-and-opportunities-after-2017\" text=\"about 60%\" >}} of Florida homeowners don’t have flood insurance despite having front-row seats to the impact hurricanes can have when they make landfall.</p>\n<p>Please note, home policies, including <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>, do have <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. However, it covers wind damage, not damage caused by storm surge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodscanhappenanywhereyesanywhere\">Floods can happen anywhere – yes, anywhere</h2>\n<p>As the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) famously noted, “Anywhere it can rain, it can flood.” That’s because it’s not proximity to the coastline or bodies of water alone that determine whether your area can flood. Depending on how your city or county manages waterways (think: dams, levees, and reservoirs) and the changes made to the land, your region may be one that faces flooding from prolonged rain, storm surge, or sudden snowmelt. If infrastructure isn’t well-maintained, urban flooding can be a big risk.</p>\n<p>Florida in particular is more at risk for floods than any other state, in part because it has 11,000 miles of rivers, streams, and waterways. But its flat terrain and urbanization (pavements and other impenetrable surfaces that impede natural drainage systems) further increase its flood risk. Plus, it experiences an average of 53.7 inches of rainfall per year.</p>\n<p>Still not sure if flood insurance is for you? These facts about floods may change your mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One inch of water can cause {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/8.5x11<em>1</em>inch_flyer.pdf\" text=\"$25,000 or more\" >}} in damage to your home.</li>\n<li>More than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-flood-insurance\" text=\"1.2 million single-family homes\" >}} risk flooding from storm surge in a category 1 hurricane; that number jumps to over 7.5 million in a category 5.</li>\n<li>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/floods/\" text=\"flooding can happen within minutes\" >}}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"federalfloodmapsareinaccurate\">Federal flood maps are inaccurate</h2>\n<p>To be fair, FEMA has a lot on its plate. It has the nearly impossible task of keeping flood hazard maps up to date for more than 22,000 communities, and it is the first to admit {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-map-revision-processes\" text=\"what a challenge that is\" >}}. Though FEMA is supposed to update its maps every five years, nearly <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-maps/\">two-thirds of flood maps</a> haven’t been updated in that time. Some maps haven’t been updated in more than 40 years.</p>\n<p>Many homeowners only purchase flood insurance if they live in a high-risk flood zone or Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), have a federally-backed mortgage, and are therefore required to have flood insurance. But if homeowners rely solely on these mandates or federal maps to inform whether or not they have flood insurance, they may put themselves at serious risk.</p>\n<p>Take Hurricane Harvey for example. The hurricane damaged more than 204,000 Houston homes, most of which were outside the federally regulated 100-year floodplain. More than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/29/where-harvey-is-hitting-hardest-four-out-of-five-homeowners-lack-flood-insurance/\" text=\"80% of these homeowners\" >}} didn’t have flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisfloodinsurancerequiredagrowingneed\">When is flood insurance required: A growing need</h2>\n<p>As our planet gets warmer and sea levels rise, flooding will only get worse. In fact, climate change contributes to four key factors that increase flood risk:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Heavier precipitation.</strong> A warmer atmosphere holds more water, and that means heavier rains. Experts have seen an increase in global precipitation and precipitation in the contiguous 48 states by {{< external-link url=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/documents/precipitation_td.pdf\" text=\"+0.02 inches per year\" >}} from 1901 to 2020. This trend is expected to grow. As you might’ve guessed, heavier rainfall increases the likelihood of floods.</li>\n<li><strong>More snowmelt.</strong> Rising temperatures also lead to faster and earlier snowmelts, which can cause an uptick in spring flooding. Winter and spring soil is too frozen or wet to absorb the snow and rain runoff from rivers, which means higher flood risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequent hurricanes.</strong> Ida. Irma. Maria. Harvey. Florence. Michael. In just the past few years alone, we’ve witnessed the catastrophic might of hurricanes, and climate change will only increase their frequency. Climate scientists predict an {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/#:\" text=\"increase in the frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes\" >}} in the Atlantic Basin with 10 to 15 percent more precipitation. And stronger storms bring greater rains, stronger winds, and stronger storm surges.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher seas.</strong> Rising ocean temperatures, which melt glaciers and ice sheets, cause sea levels to rise around the world. Not to bring you down or anything, but our oceans have already risen {{< external-link url=\"https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/\" text=\"seven to eight inches\" >}} since 1900. NOAA predicts the global sea level will rise at least {{< external-link url=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\" text=\"12 inches by 2100\" >}} on a low-emissions pathway and 8.2 feet if nothing changes. Higher seas increase high-tide flooding, which has already doubled in the last 30 years, and increases opportunities for storm surges.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"floodingissuperexpensive\">Flooding is super expensive</h2>\n<p>To cover flood losses from 2007 to 2017, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) shelled out {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20210929/more-800-million-distributed-recovery-remains-focused-30-days-after#:\" text=\"$77 million\" >}} in claims from Hurricane Ida in 2021. While this is much less than was paid for events like Hurricanes Harvey or Katrina, it’s still a lot of losses for a smaller event.</p>\n<p>Let’s break that down even further. For individual homeowners, the national average flood claim payout was {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/data-visualization/historical-flood-risk-and-costs\" text=\"$52,000\" >}} in 2019, according to FEMA. For Florida homeowners specifically, the average flood claim payout was around {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/flood-insurance/\" text=\"$29,000\" >}}. And in late 2021, FEMA announced changes to its rating system that caused <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-insurance-rates/\">flood insurance rate increases</a> for many homeowners.</p>\n<p>Now imagine facing a $29,000 repair bill without insurance. For many families, that is an impossible sum of money. They would lose their home.</p>\n<p>That’s the real reason flood insurance is for everyone. No one should be left without the means to rebuild their lives after a disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This post was originally published in February 2020.

      title: "Florida Assignment of Benefits Lawsuits by the Numbers"
      body: "<p>Claims can be stressful, so no one would blame you for trying to find someone else to deal with yours. But while an assignment of benefits (AOB) contract might seem like your ticket to a hassle-free claim process, signing one means you’ve given someone else the right to deal with your insurance company and negotiate your benefits. Unfortunately, that person - usually a contractor or adjuster - may not have your best interests at heart.</p>\n<p>Worse? The problems that come with <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignment of benefits</a> in Florida like rampant fraud and excessive litigation play a major role in the state’s rising <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> premiums. Let’s dig into these numbers to see just how big an issue AOBs are in Florida and what homeowners can do to protect themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"76ofalllawsuitsfiledagainstinsurersareinflorida\">76% of All Lawsuits Filed Against Insurers Are in Florida</h2>\n<p>According to the most recent data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Florida is responsible for {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/04/14/609721.htm\" text=\"76 percent of lawsuits\" >}} filed against insurance companies in the United States.</p>\n<p>On its own, that’s a staggering statistic. But when you add in that the Sunshine State accounts for just 8 percent of homeowners claims nationwide, you get an idea of just how big a problem assignment of benefits in Florida may be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"d15billionpaidoutinclaims\">$15 Billion Paid Out in Claims</h2>\n<p>The idea that insurance companies have paid {{< external-link url=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/12/28/florida-personal-lines-coverage-reaches-crisis-levels-part-1/?slreturn=20220102123018\" text=\"$15 billion in claims\" >}} to Floridians since 2013 may be less shocking now that you know how often insurers are sued. However, only a small percentage of that money makes it to the actual homeowners with damaged roofs and flooded basements. Property Casualty 360 broke down how much everyone gets from these payouts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attorney’s fees:</strong> 71 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Insurers’ defense costs:</strong> 21 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Property owners:</strong> 8 percent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s just $1.2 billion of the total claim payout going to the individuals who suffered losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"33ofnewlitigationstemsfromassignmentofbenefitscases\">33% of New Litigation Stems from Assignment of Benefits Cases</h2>\n<p>Another sign that assignment of benefits is a problem for Florida homeowners? The number of overall new litigation dropped for insurance companies in 2021, but the percentage of new AOB cases increased, reaching {{< external-link url=\"https://www.artemis.bm/news/assignment-of-benefit-aob-claims-rising-for-florida-pc-insurers/\" text=\"33 percent in December\" >}}. That stat is specific to the month of December, but it represents both the highest percentage of a distinct upward trend that began in the first six months of 2021.</p>\n<p>A healthy majority of new assignment of benefit cases were in just five Florida counties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Miami-Dade County</strong>: 24 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Broward County</strong>: 16 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Palm Beach County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Orange County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n<li><strong>Hillsborough County</strong>: 7 percent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount of new litigation over assignment of benefits in Florida continues to rise despite the state legislature {{< external-link url=\"https://flplg.com/sb-122-assignment-of-benefits-reform-summary\" text=\"passing a bill\" >}} to limit AOB abuse through several provisions, including prohibiting certain fees and alterations to policy provisions and transferring particular pre-lawsuit duties to the assignee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancecostsandassignmentofbenefitsinflorida\">Home Insurance Costs and Assignment of Benefits in Florida</h2>\n<p>The premiums your insurance company collects go towards its expenses, including claims and legal fees if it's sued. When those costs get out of control, your insurer often has to raise premiums to cover them. That’s one reason insurance fraud is such a big deal. Claims paid to con artists make home insurance more expensive for everyone.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, assignment of benefits in Florida appears to be rife with fraudulent claims. Some of these claims were from unethical contractors who charged for unnecessary repairs. But Florida’s one-way attorney fee statute, designed to protect homeowners from exorbitant legal fees, encouraged lawyers to take on unwinnable cases and send the bill to the insurance company.</p>\n<p>All in all, the cost of insuring homes in Florida became too great for many insurance companies. And where there are fewer companies competing for business, insurance rates can skyrocket ﹘ as evidenced by the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.wptv.com/money/real-estate-news/heres-why-home-insurance-costs-continue-to-rise-in-florida\" text=\"25 percent increase\" >}} in Florida this year alone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beonthelookoutforassignmentofbenefitscams\">Be on the Lookout for Assignment of Benefit Scams</h2>\n<p>The tricky part about AOB scams is that the swindlers claim to have specialized knowledge and then offer to solve what seems like an overwhelming problem for essentially nothing. Who wouldn’t want that? However, that is also a red flag that something is amiss. Other <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">signs of assignment of benefits scams</a> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms that look unprofessional.</li>\n<li>Claims that your damage is worse than it is.</li>\n<li>Incentives to sign an AOB, such as rebates and gift cards.</li>\n<li>Someone who is pushy about getting your benefits assigned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that you don’t need to assign away your benefits to get your claim processed. You can manage the claim yourself to ensure that you get what you are entitled to.</p>"

      title: "Florida Landlord Tenant Law in a Nutshell"
      body: "<p>When you lease out your Florida home, condo, or mobile home, you <a href=\"/blog/how-to-become-a-landlord/\">become a landlord</a> – and that means you have obligations to your tenants that are enforced by Florida law.</p>\n<p>In fact, you don’t even need a written lease to be subject to Florida’s rental laws. Under these laws, both tenants and landlords have rights and responsibilities. Landlords can be fined or penalized if they don’t comply, and tenants can face evictions for violations.</p>\n<p>Florida landlord-tenant law is outlined in the Florida Statutes, Part II, Chapter 83 – part of the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act. Here’s what you should know about it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"therulesofthelease\">The Rules of the Lease</h2>\n<p>A lease is an agreement between you, the landlord, and your tenant. Leases are usually written (and should be!), but oral lease agreements can also be legally binding, according to the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act.</p>\n<p>Essentially, a lease dictates the terms and conditions promised by both parties. Written leases may have specific terms and conditions, but they can’t be unreasonable compared to the rules established in the act. The Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act prevails over lease terms and conditions when clauses are called into question.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tenantrightsaccordingtofloridarentallaws\">Tenant Rights According to Florida Rental Laws</h2>\n<p>At the very core, the Florida landlord tenant law is meant to ensure that landlords provide a private, safe, and secure place for tenants to live in exchange for rent. This means that the dwelling needs to have proper door locks and latches and be free from building code safety violations.</p>\n<p>Under this law, Florida tenants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a right to a private, peaceful dwelling.</li>\n<li>Can use the property in a lawful way once the lease is signed and rent is paid.</li>\n<li>Must be notified in writing of a lease violation and given adequate time to remedy the problem.</li>\n<li>May withhold rent if the residence has become untenantable because a landlord has failed to meet their obligations so long as the tenant gives seven days’ written notice.</li>\n<li>Have the right to move out with proper written notice, which may be up to 60 days before the end of the lease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a tenant takes a landlord to court, the losing party may be responsible for the legal fees of the winning party. Landlords are not obligated to provide <a href=\"/faq/does-home-insurance-cover-tenants/\">insurance for tenants</a>, but it’s a good idea to have a <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance policy</a> that protects your investment and your liability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landlordresponsibilitiesaccordingtothefloridalandlordtenantlaw\">Landlord Responsibilities According to the Florida Landlord Tenant Law</h2>\n<p>Landlords have certain responsibilities to ensure that the tenants’ rights are respected. Those responsibilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide at least 12 hours of notice before entering the property to make agreed upon repairs; notice can be shortened or waived in emergency situations.</li>\n<li>To provide a dwelling that has working plumbing, hot water, and heating.</li>\n<li>To ensure the dwelling is structurally sound with working (and locking) doors and windows.</li>\n<li>To ensure the property is free of pests.</li>\n<li>To provide written notice of lease violations with adequate time to fix the problem if it is curable.</li>\n<li>To preserve the security deposit and return it within 15 days after the tenant leaves or provide written notice within 30 days if the deposit won’t be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Landlords in Florida are not responsible for upkeep on mobile homes or other structures owned by the tenant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"terminatingaleaseinflorida\">Terminating a Lease in Florida</h2>\n<p>Landlords and tenants may terminate a lease in Florida, but only in certain circumstances and with notice. If a rental agreement does state the duration of the lease, then the duration is set by how often the rent is paid (i.e., if rent is due every week, then the tenancy is week to week). This also determines how much notice either party must give before terminating the lease. Rental laws in Florida law require:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 days for a week-to-week lease.</li>\n<li>15 days for a month-to-month lease.</li>\n<li>30 days for a quarter-to-quarter lease.</li>\n<li>60 days for a year-to-year lease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Terminating lease with a set duration (e.g., one year) also requires notice. In that case, the landlord can include a notification provision that spells out how much notice the tenant must give if it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires the landlord to give the tenant notice if the lease won’t be renewed.</li>\n<li>Does not require either party to give more than 60 days’ notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Landlords can also include a provision where the tenant owes a predetermined amount of money for failing to give the required notice before vacating the residence. To do this, the landlord must alert the tenant within 15 days before the start of the notification period, explaining in writing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tenant’s obligations under the notification provision.</li>\n<li>The date the rental agreement is terminated.</li>\n<li>All the fees, charges, and penalties the tenant is responsible for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whendoesafloridatenanthavetherighttoterminatealease\">When Does a Florida Tenant Have the Right to Terminate a Lease?</h3>\n<p>Tenants can get out of a fixed-term rental agreement before its end date in a few situations. Most of these are caused by the landlord failing to meet their obligations under Florida landlord tenant law. For example, a tenant may have the right to terminate their lease if the landlord harasses them or creates an unsafe situation by violating health or safety codes. In these situations, the tenant can break the lease seven days after giving their landlord written notice.</p>\n<p>According to rental laws in Florida, members of the military can also break their leases in several situations, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving change of station orders that move them 35 miles or more away from the rental premises.</li>\n<li>Being prematurely or involuntarily discharged from duty.</li>\n<li>Being released from active duty or state active duty.</li>\n<li>Receiving orders that require them to move into government quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Service members in these and similar situations must give a written notice to their landlords with an effective date that is at least 30 days past the date the landlord receives it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whencanafloridalandlordterminatealease\">When Can a Florida Landlord Terminate a Lease?</h3>\n<p>Florida landlords can also terminate a lease if a tenant fails to meet their obligations, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping the portion of the residence they occupy clean.</li>\n<li>Using all electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, sanitary, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances in a reasonable manner.</li>\n<li>Refraining from removing, damaging, destroying, defacing, or impairing any part of the property without permission.</li>\n<li>Paying rent when it is due.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How a landlord goes about terminating a lease depends on the type of violation. Florida landlord tenant law identifies two kinds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Curable lease violations:</strong> These are violations a tenant should be allowed to fix, such as failing to keep the yard clean or having a pet when the lease forbids it. The landlord needs to notify the tenant of their violations in writing and give them seven days to rectify the situation. If the tenant doesn’t fix the violation, then the landlord may terminate the lease.</li>\n<li><strong>Incurable lease violations:</strong> These are violations that tenants shouldn’t be allowed to fix, either because they are serious in nature or they have happened several times within 12 months of a written warning. Illegal activity, continual excessive noise complaints, and intentionally damaging property are all examples of incurable violations that allow landlords to serve a seven-day notice of eviction. An example of an incurable lease violation might be a tenant conducting illegal activity on the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Failure to pay rent is another situation. Rental laws in Florida do not provide a grace period for rent so landlords can send a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.stessa.com/blog/late-rent-notice/\" text=\"late rent notice\" >}} as soon as a tenant fails to pay. Once three days have passed, excluding weekends and legal holidays, they can terminate the lease.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theevictionprocessunderfloridalandlordtenantlaw\">The Eviction Process Under Florida Landlord Tenant Law</h2>\n<p>At some point, you may need to evict a tenant (though the right screening process may help prevent that. <a href=\"/blog/first-time-landlord-tips/\">Check out these 15 landlord tips</a> for more pointers!). Terminating the lease, with all of its notification requirements, is just the first step in the eviction process.</p>\n<p>The next step is to file a complaint with the court, which involves a filing fee plus an extra fee for each summons that will be issued﹘one for every tenant. After filing, you’ll be given a court date, and the tenant will be served. This gives the tenant an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p>If the tenant decides not to contest the eviction or the judge rules against them, then the judge grants a court order with the day and time of eviction. This order goes to the sheriff who takes it to the tenant. The tenant has 24 hours to pack their stuff and go before the sheriff returns to padlock the door.</p>\n<p>If the tenant fights the eviction successfully, then they get to stay in the rental property for the remainder of the lease.</p>\n<p>Landlords must follow the Florida eviction process to regain control of their property. They can't shut off utilities, take down doors, or prevent access until the eviction is complete. Additionally, landlords can’t evict tenants who report legitimate complaints about the safety and security of the property or who have exercised their rights under fair housing laws. Retaliatory conduct on the part of the landlord can be used as a defense in the eviction process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"informationtoincludeinanevictionnotice\">Information to Include in an Eviction Notice</h3>\n<p>Florida has three types of termination for cause notices that start the eviction process. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three-day notice to pay rent or quit:</strong> A tenant may receive this notice even if they’re only a day late with the rent. This notice should include the amount owed, the rental property’s address, and date when rent must be paid before eviction proceedings.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven-day notice to cure:</strong> This notice is used when a tenant commits a curable lease violation. It should list the violation, explain they have seven days to remedy it or face eviction, and note that a second violation may result in lease termination without further warning.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven-day unconditional notice to quit:</strong> When a tenant commits an incurable violation, they get this notice to tell them their lease has been immediately terminated and that they have seven days to vacate the premises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Florida landlord tenant law, all of these must be in writing and either mailed or delivered to the tenant. Landlords may leave a copy at the premises if the tenant is absent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landlordsknowtherules\">Landlords: Know the Rules</h2>\n<p>Adhering to the Florida landlord tenant law is not only legally necessary – it also helps protect your property and your reputation. Another way to protect your property is to make sure you have the right property insurance. Get a quote for <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> today!</p>"

      title: "Fourth of July Safety Tips for Your Home"
      body: "<p>Are you ready for the Fourth of July? Independence Day is right around the corner, and that means it’s time for backyard barbeques and amazing fireworks shows!</p>\n<p>While you’re planning to celebrate the birth of our country, keep in mind that more people usually means more things can go wrong. But don’t worry﹘we’ve got your back. Take a look at our Fourth of July safety tips for your home to keep you and your loved ones safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fireworkssafety\">Fireworks Safety</h2>\n<p>The safest way to enjoy fireworks is to go to a local show run by your local government or another organization. If that’s your preference, then keep a distance of at least 500 feet from the show’s detonation center. Chances are organizers have already set a boundary to keep people safe.</p>\n<p>For those who prefer setting off fireworks at home, your first step should be to check state law. Massachusetts is the only state that bans consumer fireworks entirely, but the rest all have {{< external-link url=\"https://www.rd.com/article/states-where-fireworks-are-legal/\" text=\"regulations prohibiting various pyrotechnics\" >}} for individuals.</p>\n<p>If you are lighting your own legal fireworks, then follow these safety tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep fireworks out of the hands of children.</li>\n<li>Always point fireworks away from people or animals.</li>\n<li>Keep a bucket of water, garden hose, or fire extinguisher on hand.</li>\n<li>Use eye protection if you are lighting fireworks.</li>\n<li>Never try to relight duds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accidents can happen even when you try to be safe. Luckily, homeowners insurance <a href=\"/blog/firework-damage-homeowners-insurance/\">covers fireworks damage</a> in some situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"petsafety\">Pet Safety</h2>\n<p>You might love firework displays, but your furry friends may feel quite the opposite. In general, <a href=\"/blog/pets-and-fireworks/\">pets and fireworks don’t mix</a>. The loud, sudden booms can hurt their ears or scare them, sometimes even to the point where they run away and get lost. For that reason alone, we recommend you don’t take pets to fireworks shows﹘including the backyard kind.</p>\n<p>Your better option is to leave your pets at home in a safe, secure space, like their crate or an escape-proof room with some of their favorite chew toys. You may even want to sit and comfort them while the bulk of the fireworks goes off. If your pet is in your backyard, keep an eye on them and make sure there are no ways for them to escape.</p>\n<p>Other Fourth of July safety tips for pets include keeping them away from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hot grills.</li>\n<li>Pointy barbeque skewers.</li>\n<li>Charcoal.</li>\n<li>Table scraps. (Some {{< external-link url=\"https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/7-foods-avoid-feeding-your-dog-or-cat\" text=\"foods are toxic to pets\" >}}.)</li>\n<li>Sparklers.</li>\n<li>Glow sticks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we’re at it, remember to watch your pets for sun and heat exposure. Give them plenty of access to shade and cool water when they are outside. And never leave your pet in your car because they can quickly overheat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watersafety\">Water Safety</h2>\n<p>Nothing beats spending a hot July 4th in the water, but time in a pool, lake, ocean requires you to take some basic safety measures. For example, you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Learn swimming and water survival skills.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pay attention to the weather and get out of the water if you see the signs of a thunderstorm.</p></li>\n<li><p>Listen to the lifeguard around, if there is one, and read any safety postings.</p></li>\n<li><p>Supervise children and pets at all times.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets if you’re on a boat..</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure every swimmer has a buddy so no one swims alone.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember to drink water if it’s especially hot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Avoid drinking alcohol while swimming or boating.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, too, that pools are considered <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a> that can easily draw the attention of minors who may not have the best judgment. Make sure you limit their ability to access your swimming pool with a fence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"picnicsafety\">Picnic Safety</h2>\n<p>What’s the Fourth of July without picnics in the park and backyard barbeques? But it’s important to remember that hot temperatures means some certain foods will spoil quickly if left out. To avoid foodborne illnesses, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wash your hands before you handle or prepare food.</li>\n<li>Keep perishable foods in a cooler with a lot of ice.</li>\n<li>Fill the cooler up. (A full cooler stays cold longer.)</li>\n<li>Transport your cooler in the passenger seat of your car, not the trunk.</li>\n<li>Store your cooler in the shade or under a blanket.</li>\n<li>Cover food to prevent flies and other pests from landing on the food.</li>\n<li>Throw away food that has been sitting out for an hour or longer.</li>\n<li>Bring a food thermometer to make sure you cook foods to the proper temperature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The food itself isn’t the only source of risk at a picnic. Bad grilling habits can cause fires, so you should also remember to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only grill outdoors.</li>\n<li>Set your grill on a flat surface away from your house and any tree branches.</li>\n<li>Don’t throw starter fluid on already-ignited charcoal.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to your grill whenever it’s on and be sure to turn it of when you’re finished.</li>\n<li>Keep a spray bottle or fire extinguisher on hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following these Fourth of July safety tips can help you and your family enjoy a fun, accident-free holiday. Stay safe, everybody!</p>"

      title: "How to Prepare for a Louisiana Winter"
      body: "<p>While the Pelican State isn’t exactly known for ice and snow, Louisiana winters can get cold. And if you’re caught unprepared, you may end up with hefty heating bills and costly repairs. Worse? You may end up having to file an insurance claim and risk paying high premiums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/winterize-your-home/\">Winterizing your home</a> can help reduce risk and help you avoid costly damage and claims. Moreover, the change in seasons can be a good cue to do some of the <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">routine home maintenance</a> and preparation that keeps your home safe and sound throughout the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howbadarelouisianawinters\">How Bad Are Louisiana Winters?</h2>\n<p>Louisiana winters are short and mild compared to other areas of the country. Even in northern parts of Louisiana, winter temperatures are typically well above freezing at 37 degrees Fahrenheit. Southern Louisiana temperatures seldom go below 46 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>But Louisiana winter storms are not unheard of. In February, 2021, 23 parishes experienced winter weather so extreme that the governor requested and received {{< external-link url=\"https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3004\" text=\"a major disaster declaration\" >}}. There’s actually been at least six notable snowfalls since 2000, but the fact that winter weather events are so infrequent is part of the problem. Few Louisianans put much stock in winterizing their homes, so when bad weather does come, it often causes more trouble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforabadlouisianawinter\">How to Prepare for a Bad Louisiana Winter</h2>\n<p>Preparing for winter should be something that you do every year because you never know what has changed since you last checked it. For example, maybe you installed insulation last year only to find that a rodent has chewed through it. You’ll want to replace your insulation – and deal with the pesky rodent!</p>\n<p>Luckily, Louisiana’s mild winters make preparation easy. This basic home winterization checklist can help you reduce risks and the chances of filing a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana home insurance</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unclog your gutters.</strong> Remove leaves, dirt, and debris to prevent your gutters from getting clogged, make it easier to remove melted snow (should you have any), and keep water from pooling near your home. Ideally, you’d do this as soon as the last autumn leaves fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Insulate your pipes.</strong> Frozen pipes can burst, and that leads to flooding. The average cost of a burst pipe, <a href=\"https://www.fixr.com/costs/burst-pipe-repair\">between $200 and $1,000</a>, causes many homeowners to file insurance claims.But the better option is to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-keep-pipes-from-freezing/\">keep your pipes from freezing</a> in the first place. As an added bonus, insulating your pipes can reduce your heating costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean your chimney.</strong> Have your chimney inspected and cleaned once every year by a professional to remove creosote, the residue that can build up and cause fires. A professional can also check your chimney cap for wear and tear and make sure there are no obstructions.</li>\n<li><strong>Prune your trees.</strong> Gardening experts generally recommend <a href=\"/blog/when-to-trim-trees/\">trimming trees in the late fall and early winter</a>. This is particularly true for deciduous trees because the leaves have fallen and you can see the tree more clearly.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your flood readiness.</strong> The rainy season is long gone, but that makes the winter months a good opportunity to review your flood preparedness. Look for ways to move appliances to higher positions so you don’t have to should floodwaters rise. You might also want to review (or make!) <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">your disaster plan</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspect your storm shutters.</strong> Chances are your hurricane shutters have made it through at least a storm or two. Now that hurricane season has officially ended, take a moment to look over your <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> and consider repairing or replacing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This may also be the best time to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare for a hurricane</a> by checking your supplies and stocking up on anything that’s missing or running low. Granted, that’s not a Louisiana winterization tip, but you’d be better off having what you need on hand than running out to get it when a storm is on the way.</p>\n<p>Finally, take a moment to think back over the year. Have you made any renovations to your home? Gone through any major life chances, like a marriage or divorce? These things can impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, so if that sounds like you, talk to your agent about adjusting your coverage.</p>\n<p>With a little forward thinking and planning you can avoid costly mistakes that damage your home this winter.</p>"

      title: "Good fences make good neighbors"
      body: "<p>Got a question about fences? You came to the right place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everythingyoueverwantedtoknowaboutfences\">Everything you ever wanted to know about fences</h2>\n<p>Do you remember Robert Frost’s poem, “<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44266/mending-wall\">Mending Wall,</a>” from high school English? He spends some time contemplating whether or not “good fences make good neighbors” – today, this question seems easy enough to answer. A well-maintained fence can ease tension along a property line, as long as both parties are communicating openly and honestly.</p>\n<p>Spring makes us think a lot about our yards, landscaping opportunities, and how nice a white picket fence would look beside the driveway. Here, we’ll review the kinds of fences out there, how a good fence benefits your home, and why it’s a good idea to talk (nicely) to those who share your property lines before erecting any barriers.</p>\n<p>We’ll also answer a few common questions that often come up around fences and your homeowners insurance coverage, like “Does homeowners insurance cover fences?” and “Does my homeowners insurance cover my fence if a tree breaks it to smithereens?” to ease your mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fences101whyinstallafence\">Fences 101: Why install a fence?</h2>\n<p>A fence won’t necessarily add value to your property, but there are many good reasons to install one. Maybe you want more privacy at your backyard barbeques. Maybe the neighborhood deer are too fond of your garden. A fence can be a great way to increase your own comfort by adding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong>. Do you enjoy doing yoga outdoors in the morning light? Do you have a hot tub that you don’t want to share with the neighbors? Both are valid reasons to put up a fence.</li>\n<li><strong>Security / safety</strong>. A fence at its most basic keeps uninvited folks off your property. It creates an obstacle between your home and would-be burglars. Plus, if you have a swimming pool, it is a necessary boundary to protect the public.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear boundaries</strong>. Perhaps you’re concerned about a neighbor encroaching on your property line, or maybe it’s question of public use. If you live next to a school bus stop and the neighborhood kids have been tearing up the grass on your corner while they wait each morning, adding a fence can help enforce your property line.</li>\n<li><strong>Peace and quiet</strong>. If your house is located in a city where there’s heavy traffic or out in the suburbs near a major roadway, noise pollution can have a serious impact on your health and stress levels. The right fence can add soundproofing to make your outdoor and indoor spaces more comfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatkindoffenceisrightforyourproperty\">What kind of fence is right for your property?</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.bobvila.com/articles/types-of-fence-materials/\">many kinds of fences</a> – the right choice will depend on your motivations, your needs, and your budget.</p>\n<p>If you’ve always dreamed of having a white picket fence, that’s probably available to you. If you’re looking for a simple chain-link fence to establish a barrier between your garage access and the alley behind it, you know what to buy! Before you go to the hardware store, consider these four factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Location</strong>. Where do you want to place your fence? Are you using it to mark a property line, or do you want an ornamental length of fencing along your garden? Once you know where you’d like to place it, measure the space and map your design.</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>. Are you trying to keep your dog safe in your backyard or are you trying to block noise from the adjacent freeway? Different goals will lead you to very different materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Height</strong>. Is your fence meant to keep out strangers or is it a decoration meant to add that last touch of quaintness to your homestead? A low two-rail fence will not protect against intruders the way a five- or seven-foot fence will.</li>\n<li><strong>Material</strong>. The intended function of your fence will do a lot of determine what materials you pick. If you’re struggling to decide between vinyl or wood, cost may be the primary factor, but you should also consider longevity, as well as the cost to repair over time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whatever you choose, don’t forget to consider the cost of maintenance. Wood and vinyl require cleaning, while stone may require weeding. Wood also needs to be resealed, stained, or painted periodically.</p>\n<p>Over time, all fences will degrade in some way. Knowing how much effort you’re willing to put in will help you determine what kind of fence is right for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisafencecoveredbyhomeownersinsurance\">When is a fence covered by homeowners insurance?</h2>\n<p>Your fence is likely included in your insurance under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>, also known as other structures insurance. This means that as part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, your fence is protected against the same risks as your home, including protection in case of fire, theft, vandalism, and wind, among other things.</p>\n<p>Of course, if your fence is vandalized or someone drives their car through it, you should first file a police report to make sure the incident and damage are documented there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anoteonotherstructurescoverage\">A note on other structures coverage</h3>\n<p>Other structures insurance is typically calculated as 10 percent of the value of the main structure. If your house is insured for $175,000, your fence and garage would be protected for up to $17,500.</p>\n<p>This percentage can be adjusted to add extra protection. Make sure you compare the value of your other structures to your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenafenceisntcoveredbyyourhomeownersinsurance\">When a fence isn’t covered by your homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>Wear and tear on your fence isn’t covered by your homeowners insurance. It’s likely your responsibility to make repairs if your fence starts to lean over time, if the footings come out of the ground due to erosion, or if you start to see signs of mildew or rot.</p>\n<p>As with any structure you own, it’s important to take care of your fence, whether that means removing debris from the chainlink after a long winter, spraying it down to cut on the possibility of rust, or whitewashing the wood slats, so make sure you weave your fence into your regular <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance plan</a>.</p>\n<p>Another note: In the event that your fence sustains major damage from a flood, it would likely not be covered your homeowners insurance or flood insurance. If you live in a place with a high flood risk, consider the cost of replacement before deciding to install a fence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoresearchyourpropertylineandanyrestrictions\">How to research your property line and any restrictions</h2>\n<p>Before installing a fence, there are four things you can do to confirm your property line and restrictions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check your deed</strong>. You’ll find a written description of your lot and its boundaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Review the survey</strong>. This can be found in the town or city records if you’re having trouble digging up a copy of your sale documents. Some towns even have them available online.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/blog/how-do-i-find-my-property-lines-150061/\">Hire a surveyor</a>. If you have any doubts about where your property lines are and you’re planning on investing in a major structure, whether that be a shed, a new fence, or an addition to your house, consider <a href=\"https://www.improvenet.com/r/costs-and-prices/land-survey-cost-estimator\">the cost of hiring a surveyor</a> a sound investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your local regulations</strong>. Whether that’s within your city or in your homeowner’s association, make sure you know the height restrictions that apply to the place where you’re dreaming of putting up a fence. You can typically find this information online or at the town hall. Depending on where you live, you may need a permit or you may encounter height limits. It’s always better to be ahead of this process than to try to make corrections (and pay fines) after the fact.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before you embark on any home improvement, you should know what’s yours and what belongs to someone else. It’s common for local jurisdictions to have explicit rules about how far a fence must be set back from the property line. If you don’t know those rules, you can’t design your fence.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with your yard and your local rulebook before you make any financial or material commitments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodiscussthepropertylinecommunicationtips\">How to discuss the property line: communication tips</h2>\n<p>While you likely have the right to put a fence on your land if you’d like to, it’s a good idea to talk to your neighbors before making any major changes to your property that may impact their views. This isn’t to say that you should ask for their permission, but it’s wise to have a frank conversation in which you describe your plans.</p>\n<p>If your new fence will obstruct their views, they may be upset. Your home is an investment; it’s the place you go back to at the end of each day, and it’s important that you feel comfortable there – and the same is true for your neighbors. With this in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be proactive</strong>. Let your neighbor know you’re considering adding a fence to your property as far in advance as possible. If your neighbor walks over to your property line to ask what you’re doing because they see your contractor starting to dig footings, you’ve waited too long to discuss your new fence calmly. In this case, if your neighbor has any doubts about the position of your fence, you could find yourself facing delays while you hire a surveyor. And in the meantime, you’re stuck with a neighbor whose trust you may have lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Be direct</strong>. We’re not kidding. Let your neighbor know as much as you can so they know what to expect. If one day a 10-foot green vinyl wall appears just across the property line beside their living room windows, they may feel distressed. Be clear and detailed when you share your plans: if you’re building a fortress for privacy, say so. It’s better to know in advance to set expectations and when appropriate, provide room for compromise.</li>\n<li><strong>Be kind</strong>. You plan to live in your home on your land for many happy years and so do your neighbors. Treat them with the same decency and respect you’d like to receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neighborly disputes can have a huge impact on how you feel in your space. It’s in everyone’s best interest that things remain calm and considerate. If you can’t avoid blocking their view, which may impact their home’s value, you’ll need to carefully think through your plan before letting them know what changes are ahead.</p>\n<p>A functional or decorative fence can reinforce the visual boundary between neighbors’ properties without interrupting anyone’s day. The key is to start with an honest conversation and make sure your intentions are clear. Of course, it can’t hurt to bring a plate of cookies when you go next door to chat.</p>"

      title: "Home Insurance and Power Outages: What’s Covered?"
      body: "<p>Does homeowners insurance cover power outages? Like most questions about insurance, the answer is not a straightforward yes or no. Instead, coverage usually depends on your policy terms and the circumstances of the power outage.</p>\n<p>That may be less than reassuring to many homeowners this summer. According to the National Weather Service's {{< external-link url=\"https://www.weather.gov/fwd/summer2022outlook\" text=\"Outlook for Summer 2022\" >}}, conditions are ripe for the above normal temperatures that can often lead to power outages. Worse? A {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC<em>SRA</em>2022.pdf\" text=\"report\" >}} from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation says several regions will likely see more energy emergencies than usual.</p>\n<p>Rather than staying in the dark about <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> and power outages, let’s take a high-level look at what policies typically cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpoweroutages\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Power Outages?</h2>\n<p>Whether or not a home insurance policy covers a power outage usually depends on the cause and the location. For example, power outages that are located on your property and caused by events that are included under your policy, like windstorms or lightning strikes, are often covered.</p>\n<p>But let’s say a lightning strike at your local utility company causes a blackout over a wide area that includes your house. In that case, the source of the power outage is not on your property, and that often means your home insurance doesn’t cover it.</p>\n<p>The same is generally true of power outages caused by perils not covered by your home insurance, like flooding. If a flood causes a power outage, you may only have a claim if you carry <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverspoiledfoodfromapoweroutage\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Spoiled Food from a Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>When a power outage is caused by a covered peril, you may have limited coverage for spoiled food. So if a tree on your property knocks out your power lines, you might be compensated for the items in your refrigerator that go bad. However, this isn’t true in other situations, such as a power outages caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planned rolling brownouts.</li>\n<li>Your service being cut off for nonpayment.</li>\n<li>A failure of the electrical grid.</li>\n<li>Excluded events, such as earthquakes, flood, and normal wear and tear.</li>\n<li>Malfunctioning or poorly installed equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most insurance companies limit the amount of coverage they offer for spoiled, usually to around $500, plus you may be responsible for a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. On the other hand, you may be able to get reimbursement for your spoiled food by contacting your power company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverhotelstaysduringpoweroutage\">Does Home Insurance Cover Hotel Stays During Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>A power outage seldom triggers your homeowners policy’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>. Also called Coverage D, loss of use coverage pays a portion of your additional living expenses when your home is made uninhabitable by a covered peril. This can include a hotel room so that you have a safe place to stay. While it may be uncomfortable, your home is usually considered habitable during a blackout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areelectronicscoveredwhendamagedbyapoweroutage\">Are Electronics Covered When Damaged by a Power Outage?</h2>\n<p>As with some of our other examples, you may be able to file an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a> for your electronics if they’re damaged by a power outage that’s caused by a covered peril. Imagine for instance, that a lightning strike causes a <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a> that results in a blackout. Power surges can easily damage computers, televisions, and other plugged-in electronics, but you may be able to repair or replace them because lightning strikes are a covered peril.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverfrozenpipesifmypowergoesout\">Does Home Insurance Cover Frozen Pipes If My Power Goes Out?</h2>\n<p>Granted, we’re focusing on hot weather, but extreme temperatures in the winter can also cause power outages. When that happens, it’s not uncommon for your pipes to freeze. This can lead to your pipes bursting.</p>\n<p>In many instances, the water damage that follows is often covered by home insurance. However, your claim may be denied if your pipes were in poor condition, either because of wear and tear or inadequate maintenance.</p>\n<p>Having quality insurance and knowing what it covers is just the first step in protecting your home. The next is making sure you’re ready for the worst-case scenario – including <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prep-for-a-power-outage/\">preparing for power outages</a> in your home.</p>"

      title: "Home network security: How to be cyber safe"
      body: "<p>These days, people’s homes are filled with televisions, computers, mobile phones, gaming consoles and even appliances that all connect to the internet. While all of these internet-connected devices simplify our lives, they can also make it easier for unscrupulous people to access our homes. The result? Home network security needs to be a priority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomenetwork\">What is a home network?</h2>\n<p>Your home network is all of the devices in your house that connect to the internet and each other. Some examples of these devices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computers.</li>\n<li>Televisions</li>\n<li>Smartphones.</li>\n<li>Gaming devices.</li>\n<li>Smart appliances.</li>\n<li>Printers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, many homeowners have a broadband connection that uses a modem and a router to give multiple devices internet access.</p>\n<p>Hackers can take advantage of vulnerabilities in your home network to install malware, steal data, or commit <a href=\"/glossary/identity-fraud-insurance/\">identity fraud</a>. These tips can reduce the likelihood of that happening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1updateyourhomenetworksnameandpassword\">1. Update your home network’s name and password</h2>\n<p>One of the first things you should do when securing your home network is to change the default name and password of your home network. By changing the network name, also called the Service Set Identifier (SSID), to a non-generic name, you show cyber criminals that you’re paying attention.</p>\n<p>Hackers often target home networks using a default name because they assume the owner isn’t managing the system. Moreover, cyber criminals can recognize the manufacturer of a router by its default name and any vulnerabilities associated with it. Changing your networks’ name makes it more difficult to exploit.</p>\n<p>You should also change the default password of your router to a strong password with at least 12 characters that’s a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Leaving the default password on a router can make it easier to hack – especially if the router manufacturer is well known in cyber communities.</p>\n<p>One last note: When setting up a custom SSID and password, you never want to use personal information, such as your name and address. Passwords with personal information can be easily guessed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2useaguestnetwork\">2. Use a guest network</h2>\n<p>Having guests over is great, but it usually means you’ll have additional devices logging in on your home network. Unfortunately, your guest’s smartphone could have malware that can attack other devices connected to your WiFi.</p>\n<p>A guest network lets your friends connect to your WiFi without giving them access to any folders, network devices, or storage devices that are shared on your primary network. Setting one up is usually easy to do from your device settings. Just remember you’ll need to create a separate SSID and strong password to go along with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3turnonyourrouterfirewall\">3. Turn on your router firewall</h2>\n<p>Router firewalls should be turned on as they are great ways to protect against unwanted traffic from going in and out of your home network. They essentially act as a barrier to your network from other internet devices, while still allowing devices on your network to connect to other internet devices. Router firewalls may be off by default, so you need to double check this setting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4encryptyourhomenetwork\">4. Encrypt your home network</h2>\n<p>Most routers come with an encryption option that can be turned on and allow you to further secure your network. These encryption levels include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WEP.</strong> This stands for wired equivalent privacy, and it’s the first level of security developed to provide the same level of security found in wired networks.</li>\n<li><strong>WPA2</strong>. Developed in 2004, WPA2 increases the security found in WEP.</li>\n<li><strong>WPA3.</strong> WPA3 was created to both simplify WiFi security and improve upon features found in WPA2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should aim to use WPA2 or WPA3 because they are more secure, but all these options encrypt the information that is sent and received over your home network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5disableremoteaccess\">5. Disable remote access</h2>\n<p>Many routers have a remote access feature that allows your WiFi network to be accessible from anywhere there is an internet connection. That may be an amazing convenience for you, but it also makes it easy for a hacker to gain entry into your home. Unless you absolutely need the feature, it’s best to turn off the remote access setting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6updateyourfevicesregularly\">6. Update your fevices regularly</h2>\n<p>Both your home network and the devices connected to it need to be updated. Devices not up to date may have vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited by criminals, so patching them whenever a new update is released is so important.</p>\n<p>Some devices like routers may not be updated automatically, so you want to get in the habit of updating your router manually on a recurring basis. This can go a long way towards making your home network more secure. The process for this is different with every router, so take the time to look up how to install updates or turn on automatic updates if possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7turnoffyournetworkwhenyougo\">7. Turn off your network when you go</h2>\n<p>If you are going on vacation or leaving your house for an extended period of time, it’s best to turn off your router. This helps ensure no one has access to your home network. Hackers will be unable to see or target your devices, giving you peace of mind while away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheauthors\">About the authors</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigailschulte/\"><em>Abby Schulte</em></a> <em>is a senior security analyst with Kin Insurance.

      body: "<p>We’re in the business of home insurance, which means we’re ready to help when something goes wrong at your house. But it also means we’re big fans of home safety. When homeowners put safety first, they usually end up filing fewer insurance claims. That’s good for us and them!</p>\n<p>We’ve put together this list of common household hazards and home safety tips to help you reduce accidents and claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"housefires\">House Fires</h2>\n<p>According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the US saw an average of approximately {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Building-and-Life-Safety/Home-Structure-Fires\" text=\"346,800 home fires\" >}} in one five year period. The main causes for these fires were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooking, 50 percent.</li>\n<li>Heating equipment, 13 percent.</li>\n<li>Electrical distribution and lighting equipment, 9 percent.</li>\n<li>Intentional, 7 percent.</li>\n<li>Smoking materials, 5 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the cause of a home fire, the results can be devastating, leading to property damage, injuries, and sadly, even death. That makes <a href=\"/blog/fire-prevention-for-homeowners/\">fire prevention</a> an important part of home safety. These tips can help you protect your home and family:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never leave the kitchen unattended while cooking.</li>\n<li>Keep flammable items like oven mitts, curtains, and food packaging away from your stovetop.</li>\n<li>Save extension cords for temporary use and plug electric devices directly into wall outlets.</li>\n<li>Remove power cords from doorways and from underneath carpets.</li>\n<li>Store matches and lighters out of children’s reach.</li>\n<li>Service your furnace annually to keep it clean and working properly to avoid potential fires.</li>\n<li>Replace old or <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a>.</li>\n<li>Always be careful when burning candles or smoking in the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, be sure you have smoke detectors on every floor of your house and test them every month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swimmingpoolinjuries\">Swimming Pool Injuries</h2>\n<p>While backyard pools are a great way to entertain family and friends, they also present some serious hazards for homeowners and guests alike. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the US sees {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/facts/index.html\" text=\"3,960 fatal drownings\" >}} and 8,080 nonfatal drowning every year. This risk is one of the reasons swimming pools are often considered an <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisance</a> that may impact your homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>You can do a lot to increase pool safety, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building a fence around your pool to limit access.</li>\n<li>Monitoring children and pets whenever they’re in or near the pool.</li>\n<li>Enrolling your children in water safety and swimming lessons.</li>\n<li>Installing a safety vacuum release system and anti-entrapment drain covers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"falls\">Falls</h2>\n<p>While just about anyone may experience a fall, the people most likely to be injured from one are young children and the elderly. The annual count of older adults reporting falls is north of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html#\" text=\"36 million\" >}}, according to the CDC. On the other end of the spectrum, Stanford’s Children’s Health claims more than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=falls--injury-statistics-and-incidence-rates-90-P02974#\" text=\"2.2 million children\" >}} under the age of 14 visit hospital emergency rooms for fall injuries each year.</p>\n<p>A big part of fall prevention is to be on the lookout for tripping hazards. Toys, pet gear, loose rugs, and electrical cords can all cause someone to trip. But you might also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place furniture so there is plenty of space to walk around a room.</li>\n<li>Put grab bars and non-slip rubber mats in your bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Add railings to your staircases, both inside and out.</li>\n<li>Upgrade your lighting.</li>\n<li>Install window guards.</li>\n<li>Use a sturdy step stool to reach higher shelves.</li>\n<li>Put soft materials under play equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"poisoning\">Poisoning</h2>\n<p>The most recent data available shows that poison control centers across the US guided more than {{< external-link url=\"https://www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national\" text=\"2.1 million people\" >}} after poison exposures. According to the National Capital Poison Center, that’s one poison exposure reported to a poison control center every 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Here are some home safety tips to reduce the chances of poisoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep poisonous substances including medications, cleaners, and detergents on a high shelf or behind a locked cabinet door.</li>\n<li>Avoid mixing household chemicals.</li>\n<li>Get all medications in childproof packaging.</li>\n<li>Keep cleaners, chemicals, and medications in their original containers.</li>\n<li>Avoid eating or drinking when around poisonous substances, including art supplies.</li>\n<li>Avoid using pesticides around children and pets.</li>\n<li>Stay vigilant when handling any chemicals or medicines when you have young children around. If you’re suddenly called away﹘even for a minute﹘secure what your using to keep your children safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s another set of poisons in addition to those that someone might ingest. Substances like carbon monoxide, radon, mold, asbestos, and lead paint may be even more hazardous because they can exist in your home without you even knowing about it.</p>\n<p>Home safety tips to protect your family from these harmful toxins usually involves hiring a professional, but you may also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with when and where asbestos and lead paint were commonly used.</li>\n<li>Install carbon monoxide alarms.</li>\n<li>Avoid idling your car in your garage.</li>\n<li>Make sure your rooms and any fuel-burning appliances are well ventilated.</li>\n<li>Buy a radon test kit.</li>\n<li>Use a dehumidifier to keep humidity levels below 50 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before doing any work in the house, check with an expert to make sure you aren’t exposing your family to these hazardous substances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"naturaldisasters\">Natural Disasters</h2>\n<p>Natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, present a serious risk for homeowners. One report found that 13 major disasters from 2021 caused an estimated {{< external-link url=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220217005368/en/CoreLogic-Climate-Change-Catastrophe-Report-Estimates-1-in-10-U.S.-Residential-Properties-Impacted-by-Natural-Disasters-in-2021\" text=\"$56.92 billion\" >}} in property damage to nearly 15 million single- and multifamily homes.</p>\n<p>You can’t prevent natural disasters, but you can minimize their impact on your home. The first step is to figure out what sort of <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> you face. A good way to do that is with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/national-risk-index\" text=\"National Risk Index\" >}} that risk communities have for 18 natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Once you know what your exposures are, you can shore up your protection with these home safety tips for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flood.</strong> Easy steps to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">minimize flood damage</a> include cleaning your gutters regularly, using mulch in your garden, and installing a backflow valve.</li>\n<li><strong>Hurricane.</strong> Maintaining your roof is key to <a href=\"/prep/\">preparing your home for a hurricane</a>.

      title: "Homeowner Horror Stories"
      body: "<p>Between inspections and paperwork, a lot can go wrong when buying a home. We asked people about their worst homeowner horror stories to help you avoid major headaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aninfestationyoucantgetcovered\">An Infestation You Can’t Get Covered</h2>\n<p>As a cash homebuyer and owner of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.webuyhousesinpennsylvania.com\" text=\"We Buy Houses In Pennsylvania\" >}}, Ryan David thought he had seen it all. But when he and his wife bought a house for their personal residence, they quickly discovered they had uninvited guests: fleas!</p>\n<p>They couldn’t move into their new home immediately, so they only found out about the “super flea infestation” several months after closing. As a result, David says they “spent hundreds of dollars on flea removal.”</p>\n<p>Worse? The experience still haunts him: “Every time I walk into an empty home I'll always be on the lookout for fleas.”</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Unfortunately for David and his wife, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t usually cover damage caused by pests like fleas, termites, and rodents. They may have been able to protect themselves by requesting a pest inspection prior to closing in addition to a <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aninspectionmostdontthinkof\">An Inspection Most Don’t Think Of</h2>\n<p>Rick Conti says “many homeowners willingly do a termite inspection, but often skip the bed bug inspection.” And in his experience, that choice can cost homeowners anxiety, stress, and money.</p>\n<p>Conti’s company {{< external-link url=\"https://doctorsniffs.com/\" text=\"Doctor Sniffs Bed Bug Dogs\" >}} recently worked with a client who had a home inspection prior to buying a house. After sealing the deal, the client started renovations﹘which is when the trouble began.</p>\n<p>“As they tore down walls and pulled back moldings,” he says, “the bed bugs began turning up. They called us in and our dogs searched the entire house, finding bed bugs all over the place.”</p>\n<p>Bed bugs are nocturnal, according to Conti. They prefer the dark and like cracks and crevices, so the new homeowners did not notice anything beforehand. The experience was so terrible, the homeowners told Conti they wouldn't have bought the house if they’d known about the bed bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Like fleas, bed bugs and the damage they cause aren’t typically covered by a homeowners policy. But you can also get a bed bug inspection to root out any problems if you’re concerned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"awhirlwindofpaperworkgetslost\">A Whirlwind of Paperwork Gets Lost</h2>\n<p>Founder of {{< external-link url=\"https://academialabs.com\" text=\"Academia Labs\" >}} Craig Miller says a simple mix-up with his wife caused his homeowner horror story. The couple experienced minor wind damage from a tornado, so their agent sent them paperwork to file an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>.</p>\n<p>“After completing all the necessary documents,” says Miller “I placed them on the coffee table in our living room. When I did not see them the next day, I assumed that my wife had submitted the paperwork to the agent, so I just waited.”</p>\n<p>Miller waited patiently﹘for six months. At that point, he followed up with his agent only to be told that the agent had never received the claim documents. It turns out that Miller’s wife had put the papers in a desk drawer, which meant they hadn’t been filed in time and the Millers’ claim was ultimately denied.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Miscommunications happen, but <a href=\"/glossary/policyholder/\">policyholders</a> are required to promptly report claims so it’s important to stay on top of your paperwork. Start by deciding who is responsible for actually filing the claim. That way, you avoid assumptions and confusion.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don’t wait to follow up with your agent. You should have an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">insurance adjuster</a> to your home within days and at a maximum two weeks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragedidntstartatthecloseofescrow\">Coverage Didn’t Start at the Close of Escrow</h2>\n<p>Marina Vaamonde, a residential real estate investor with {{< external-link url=\"https://housecashin.com\" text=\"House Cashin\" >}}, didn’t follow her insurance agent’s advice and it ended up costing her dearly. She was in the process of closing on a new home when she contacted her agent about home insurance.</p>\n<p>She says, “He told me to wait for a day to close on the house so that the policy could kick in the day that I took ownership.” Instead of following that sage advice, Vaamonde decided to go one day without coverage. Unfortunately, that’s the day a deer crashed through her new home’s sliding glass door. And because her homeowners policy wasn’t effective until the next day, Vaamonde was responsible for all of the repair bills.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway.</strong> Insurance might seem like overkill during that brief window between closing on a house and moving in, but Vaamonde’s story shows just how risky that can be. Remember that you’re responsible for your home the moment you close, even if you aren’t living there, so home insurance is key to protecting your investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theinspectiondidntshowaproblem\">The Inspection Didn’t Show a Problem</h2>\n<p>Jake Romano has seen several homeowner horror stories in his work with {{< external-link url=\"https://johntheplumber.ca/oakville\" text=\"John the Plumber\" >}}. One client, Romano says, purchased a home in the winter. Despite everything seeming fine during the inspection, the house turned out to be prone to flooding in the spring. He says the client ended up installing a sump pit, sump pump, battery backup sump pump, and weeping tiles all in the first spring they lived in the home.</p>\n<p>Homeowners can prevent a major problem like this by having a plumber do an inspection with a camera to see the health of the pipes all the way to the street, where they become the city’s responsibility.</p>"

      title: "Home Insurance Prices: Where Are They Now?"
      body: "<p>Having a sense of where homeowners insurance prices are makes you a more informed buyer.</p>\n<p>Nationally, prices for homeowners insurance have increased modestly in the last few years: the <a href=\"http://thoughtleadership.aonbenfield.com/documents/20171016-ab-analytics-homeowners-roe-outlook.pdf\">Aon Benfield 2018 Homeowners’ ROE Outlook Report</a> shows that prices from the country’s top 20 carriers increased by just three percent in the 18 months leading up to August of last year.</p>\n<p>But national averages hide a lot, especially when it comes to homeowners insurance costs. Here’s a deeper dive of what the picture looks like in a few harder-hit states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepricesinfloridaareup5\">Home Insurance Prices in Florida Are Up 5%</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> prices rose faster than the nation as a whole, jumping five percent from from February 2016 through August 2017. One factor that affects the price of homeowners insurance is natural disaster activity. Considering Hurricane Irma hit Florida on August 30 of last year, it’s reasonable to expect that prices might continue to rise for the residents of the Sunshine State.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepricesintexasandnorthcarolinaup7\">Home Insurance Prices in Texas and North Carolina: Up 7%</h2>\n<p>Despite the higher-than-average price hike, though, Florida’s price increases weren’t the country’s largest. <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a> and North Carolina both saw seven percent increases in the same period. Again, given that Harvey struck Texas at the tail end of the period measured, there’s a chance that future prices may be even higher.</p>\n<p>Depending on the larger picture, though, it’s also possible that homeowners insurance prices will be relatively unaffected by the major <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>; instead, the cost of <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> may see a bump. Flood coverage is not included in a typical homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p>One more important note for North Carolinians: the <a href=\"https://portcitydaily.com/local-news/2018/04/20/homeowners-insurance-to-increase-by-5-5-percent-on-the-coast/\">insurance department recently agreed to a rate increase</a>. The statewide average increase is 4.8 percent, but some coastal areas will see increases as much as 5.5 percent (which is far lower than what the state’s rating board requested). What this means for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The state of North Carolina will now allow homeowners insurance carriers to charge slightly higher rates.</li>\n<li>Individual carriers may want to charge more than the state-mandated maximum because they believe they have to do so to remain profitable.</li>\n<li>If you receive such a request from your insurer (a “request to rate” letter), read the fine print. If you don’t accept the request to pay more than the state’s maximum, your carrier may not renew your coverage. (But you can always look for coverage from a different company.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"biggesthomeownersinsurancepriceincreasesinokksco\">Biggest Homeowners Insurance Price Increases in OK, KS, CO</h2>\n<p>One of the industry’s most comprehensive looks at homeowners insurance prices is published by the <a href=\"https://www.naics.com/\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> (NAIC). The most recent report looks at prices from 2007 to 2015 and found the largest increases in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado (ranking first, second, and third, respectively).</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at the causes of those price increases and some ways homeowners in those states can help keep their rates low:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2018/05/02/487938.htm\">Oklahoma</a>: Blame the rise on natural disasters. Between 2007 and 2015, annual premiums for OK homeowners increased by an average of $825. Homeowners who opt for tornado-resistant features (either on new construction or as retrofittings for existing homes) may see some savings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/news/2018/03/29/study-home-insurance-price-increases-hit-kansas.html\">Kansas</a>: Hail, tornadoes, and fire incidents all contributed to the $627 average price increase for KS homeowners. As is true anywhere in the country, making sure you have safety features in place may help reduce your premiums.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/consumer/colorado-home-insurance-rates-rising-among-fastest-in-the-nation\">Colorado</a>: The average yearly insurance premium increases of $557 for CO homeowners can be attributed to both natural disaster activity and the type of new homes being built. Larger homes with higher-quality features (which were apparently popular in Colorado during the period measured) cost more to insure, regardless of what Mother Nature is up to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re looking to save money on your homeowners insurance, we may be able to help. <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Apply for coverage with Kin today</a>. It takes just a couple minutes and you’ll be able to compare a real quote (not an estimate) with what you’re already paying.</p>"

      title: "House Siding Options: Pros & Cons"
      body: "<p>The type of siding you have on your home dramatically affects its curb appeal, but how it looks shouldn’t be your only consideration. Some house siding options are better suited for certain climates, are more durable, or cost less than others. Another issue to keep in mind? The general aesthetic of your neighborhood</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of factors to weigh, so let’s look at the pros and cons of some of the most common exterior siding options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stuccosiding\">Stucco Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-stucco.jpg\" alt=\"House with white stucco siding\" title=\"Stucco siding works well in dry climates.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Stucco siding works well in dry climates.</small></i></p>\n<p>Stucco is a popular exterior siding option for many <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">styles of homes</a>. It mixes cement with sand or lime, and homeowners love it because its clean look and ability to be tinted in many colors. Stucco is best used in areas where there isn’t a substantial rainy season. The material's porous nature can cause it to saturate in more damp climates.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of stucco is up to 80 years, but it can crumble. And while the materials are inexpensive, installation is labor intensive and drives the expense up. Stucco siding costs around $7 to $9 per square foot, and re-stuccoing a home adds about $1 per square foot for removing the old stucco.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vinylsiding\">Vinyl Siding</h2>\n<p>Vinyl siding is fabricated from PVC plastics and can last up to 60 years. Unlike some other house siding options, vinyl doesn't rot or flake, and it can keep your home cooler during summer months because it reflects the sun’s rays. However, vinyl siding may fade and crack, an it can even melt in extreme heat. Plus, the manufacturing process raises environmental concerns for many homeowners.</p>\n<p>Builders use vinyl siding because it is less expensive to purchase and install. Insulated varieties cost anywhere from $4 to $12 per square foot, and non-insulated only typically cost $3.50 to $8 per square foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"woodclapboardsiding\">Wood Clapboard Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-wood-clapboard.jpg\" alt=\"Contemporary home with wood clapboard siding\" title=\"Wood clapboard siding can work well with contemporary styles\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Wood clapboard siding can work well with contemporary styles</small></i></p>\n<p>Wood clapboard siding consists of overlapping horizontal wood boards. This pattern is not only attractive, but it prevents moisture from collecting beneath them. Additionally, homeowners can stain or paint the siding to customize the look. Wood clapboard is a good insulator, though homeowners need to be concerned with warping and pest infestation.</p>\n<p>This is a more expensive exterior siding option, costing anywhere from $6 to $10 per square foot depending on where you live. Currently, <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber prices are sky high</a> - even after a recent tumble - so wood clapboard may be especially expensive right now. This cost, however, is counteracted with routine maintenance that can help clapboard last centuries. Without maintenance, the wood can rot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stoneveneersiding\">Stone Veneer Siding</h2>\n<p>Stone veneers give homes a rustic look, but the quality of stone veneers ranges widely. Some clearly look manufactured rather than like real slate or limestone. However, stone veneer siding is more fire resistant than wood-based siding options and protects your home from harsh weather. Stone is also a good insulator because the material absorbs heat and releases it slowly to help regulate the temperature in your home.</p>\n<p>Because they last up to 70 years without much maintenance, stone veneers are a fairly durable and convenient siding option. The cost of stone veneer siding is anywhere from $5.50 to $10.75 per square foot in most areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brickandbrickveneersiding\">Brick and Brick Veneer Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-brick.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of a red brick house\" title=\"Brick is one of the most durable house siding options available.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Brick is one of the most durable house siding options available.</small></i></p>\n<p>Many people like the look of brick siding, but it’s also known for its durability. Real brick can last for more than a century with little to no maintenance. When brick does need maintenance, it usually involves re-mortaring deteriorating joints.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of brick is that it's fire resistant and keeps homeowners safe. Plus, it offers decent insulation, particularly if you go with brick veneer. The cost, however, is another matter. Solid brick walls can cost upwards of $50 per square foot. Brick veneer doesn’t last as long as, but it’s about significantly less expensive than brick, costing $4 to $10 per square foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fibercementsiding\">Fiber Cement Siding</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot to like about fiber cement siding: it’s fireproof, termite-proof, durable, easily maintained, and aesthetically versatile. You can get fiber cement siding that looks like wood, stucco, or masonry, and it can last up to 50 years. It’s also inexpensive, costing between $5 and $14 per square foot for cement fiber siding.</p>\n<p>However, this type of siding has some disadvantages. For one, manufacturers often used asbestos to make it, so owners of older homes may need to cover their cement fiber with a new, more modern siding. Fiber cement siding is also not a great insulator, although it does a good job of protecting the layers of insulation under it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boardandbattensiding\">Board-and-Batten Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-board-batten.jpg\" alt=\"Modern white farmhouse with board-and-batten siding\" title=\"Boad-and-batten siding helps homes look taller.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Boad-and-batten siding helps homes look taller.</small></i></p>\n<p>Unlike wood clapboard, board-and-batten siding runs vertically, not horizontally. This design feature helps smaller buildings look taller. The wood, usually pine, is a good insulator on its own, but there’s usually a layer of rigid foam insulation beneath the boards. It should last 25 years or more but does require maintenance to prevent rot and pest infestation. Installation costs range from $2.25 to $12.50 per square foot including materials and labor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"seamlesssteelsiding\">Seamless Steel Siding</h2>\n<p>Seamless steel siding has several advantages over other house siding options. The first is aesthetics. Each panel of siding is customized to fit the entire length of your home, so you don’t see any splices. Steel siding is also fire resistant and low maintenance. While it expands and contracts with changing weather conditions, the effect is minimal, so you shouldn’t see a lot of warping or cracking. Plus, seamless steel costs just $3 to $6 per square foot.</p>\n<p>On the downside, seamless steel siding is difficult to install. And once you’ve got it up, you’re going to be stuck with whatever color you’ve picked for the next 20 years or so. This also isn’t the best exterior siding option if you’re on the coast. High winds can increase the holes around the fasteners, which can ultimately cause the siding to fail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cedarshinglesiding\">Cedar Shingle Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-cedar.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of the stonework and cedar siding on the entrance of a contempory home\" title=\"Cedar siding is beautiful but requires routine maintenance.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Cedar siding is beautiful but requires routine maintenance.</small></i></p>\n<p>In cedar shingle and shake siding, precisely milled cedar is layered in an overlapping pattern to reduce moisture accumulation. Both types of siding look wonderful in wooded surroundings, especially if you choose to stain rather than paint it. You can expect cedar shakes and shingles to cost anywhere from $6 to $15 per square foot depending on where you live.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawback to cedar shingle siding is maintenance. Shakes can last up to 30 years, but you’ll likely need to replace rotted or flaking shingles within 15 years. You’ll also have to be cognizant of pests that can damage and destroy the cedar shingle siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"engineeredwoodsiding\">Engineered Wood Siding</h2>\n<p>Engineered wood siding, also called wood composite, is a durable but affordable home siding option. It usually costs less than $9.00 per square foot for installation and lasts between 20 and 30 years in most parts of the country.</p>\n<p>Engineered wood is made of wood products and other materials that are easy to maintain and provide decent insulation. While it doesn’t look exactly like wood, it can have a more natural appearance than vinyl or metal siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aluminumsiding\">Aluminum Siding</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/house-siding-options-aluminum.jpg\" alt=\"Ranch home with aluminum siding\" title=\"Aluminum siding is popular for its affordability and durability.\" /></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><i><small>Aluminum siding is popular for its affordability and durability.</small></i></p>\n<p>Aluminum siding is another affordable house siding option that’s more environmentally friendly than vinyl siding. Because it is metal, it is not a good insulator on its own, but it’s usually sold with insulation. It has a long life span, lasting 50 years or more with little maintenance required. In fact, aluminum siding is popular along the coast because it resists rust. However, it's likely to suffer dents. A homeowner can expect to pay anywhere from $3 to $6 per square foot for aluminum siding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"corrugatedmetalsiding\">Corrugated Metal Siding</h2>\n<p>Often considered industrial, corrugated metal siding has a long lifespan - 50 years or longer - with little maintenance. Metal doesn’t offer quality insulation, but it is fireproof and pest-proof. It costs approximately $3 to $7 per square foot to install corrugated metal siding.</p>\n<p>Cost is an important factor when you’re working through your house siding options. But remember, the per square foot price is just part of that consideration. Siding that lasts longer or that requires less maintenance can actually come out cheaper in the long run.</p>"

      title: "Housing Market Predictions 2022"
      body: "<p>Anyone who went house hunting last year knows what it’s like to deal with a seller’s market. The combination of low interest rates and low housing inventory pushed demand up and the competition for available homes fierce. Will that pattern continue? We looked at experts’ housing market predictions for 2022 to see what’s in store.</p>\n<h2 id=\"itsstillasellersmarket\">It’s Still a Seller’s Market</h2>\n<p>Early housing market predictions from economists indicated that 2022 would continue to be a seller’s market, although not at the pace we saw in 2021. In January, Chief Economist Lawrence Yun from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) {{< external-link url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/10/2022-housing-market-predictions\" text=\"predicted home sales would decline\" >}} slightly, but stay above pre-pandemic numbers. Experts at Zillow made {{< external-link url=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-2022-housing-predictions-30394\" text=\"similar predictions\" >}}, saying certain metrics would stick, namely low housing inventory, high demand, and low mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"housinginventorywillseemodestgrowth\">Housing Inventory Will See Modest Growth</h2>\n<p>The supply chain issues that push up prices at the gas pump also impact the cost of building materials, as shown by last year’s <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">skyrocketing lumber costs</a>. According to Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), problems with the supply chain, and therefore inflation and the pace of construction, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nahb.org/blog/2022/02/housing-affordability-will-remain-a-significant-challenge-in-2022\" text=\"will continue into 2022\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Looking at these supply chain issues next to significant labor shortages in the construction industry led Dietz to predict limited growth in single-family home production this year. However, multi-family home starts may help pick up the slack for an overall increase of 2.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Mike Gregor of the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.sellitmike.com/\" text=\"Cohen Agency\" >}} thinks he’s already seen some growth in the housing supply. “Real estate market sale listings have been increasing for five consecutive months.” This could ease the competition for each home down even though the market as a whole benefits sellers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mortgagerateswillcontinuetorise\">Mortgage Rates Will Continue to Rise</h2>\n<p>Low mortgage rates, {{< external-link url=\"https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart\" text=\"averaging 2.65 percent\" >}} for a 30-year mortgage, were a major factor in 2021’s hot real estate market. So when most Federal Reserve members predicted at least {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/the-majority-of-fed-members-forecast-three-interest-rate-hikes-in-2022-to-fight-inflation.html\" text=\"three interest rate hikes\" >}} back in December, economists factored that into their housing market predictions for 2022, saying rising mortgage rates would put a damper on sales.</p>\n<p>You may have not noticed any difference if you were looking to purchase a home in the first few months of 2022. That’s partly because many people dove into the market hoping to buy before mortgage rates started going up. As of April 14, 2021, the average for a 30-year fixed mortgage was {{< external-link url=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US\" text=\"5 percent\" >}}. That may not be a historic low, but it’s still much better than previous years.</p>\n<p>Experts still predict that mortgage rates will continue to rise, and that impacts the overall cost of a home. As Patrick O’Sullivan, the owner of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.getmultifamily.com/\" text=\"Get MULTIfamily\" >}}, explains, “The higher our mortgage rates, the higher your overall mortgage payments. That means higher monthly costs for you.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"buyingahousein2022\">Buying a House in 2022</h2>\n<p>When you look at housing market predictions for 2022, the year looks like a mixed bag. Sellers still have the upper hand, but experts anticipate some of the pressures that push prices higher will ease ﹘ but slowly, and maybe not until 2023.</p>\n<p>That said, if a new home is part of your 2022 plans, then you’re going to want to keep a close eye on the markets where you hope to buy. You may have fewer options to choose from, so you’ll want to move quickly when you find a home that meets your needs. Pay attention to mortgage rates too. Most experts expect them to keep going up, which is another reason you may need to move quickly.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important tip for <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-in-a-sellers-market/\">buying a house in a seller’s market</a> is to think carefully about your budget. Offers above the asking price may be the norm for a while longer, and new homebuyers are often surprised by the additional costs, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, appraisal fees, and property taxes.</p>\n<p>Get more budgeting tips in our article “<a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">13 Ways to Afford a House</a>.”</p>"

      title: "How Government Shutdowns Impact Homeowners"
      body: "<p>Sad but true: when the government screeches to a halt, homeowners may feel the effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"governmentshutdownsimpacthomeloansinsuranceandfederalaid\">Government Shutdowns Impact Home Loans, Insurance, and Federal Aid</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot of news out there about what happens during a government shutdown. But we’re interested in how it could affect homeowners and those in the process of buying a home. For now, assume everything in here applies to the ongoing partial government shutdown of 2019 that started in December 2018; if we update this post to address future shutdowns, we’ll make note of that here.</p>\n<p>There are several government services relevant to homeowners that could be impacted by a government shutdown. We’ll look at the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Government-backed mortgage loans (FHA, USDA, and VA)</li>\n<li>Mortgage underwriting supported by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</li>\n<li>NFIP <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a></li>\n<li>FEMA disaster recovery aid</li>\n<li>HUD-backed home improvement loans</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"effectofagovernmentshutdownonmortgageloans\">Effect of a Government Shutdown on Mortgage Loans</h2>\n<p>The federal government provides two main types of assistance for mortgages: loan insurance and actual mortgage loans. Both may be affected by the ongoing 2019 government shutdown.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fhamortgageloans\">FHA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) makes it easier for some first-time homebuyers to get a mortgage by offering <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>. An FHA-backed loan typically requires less money down than a standard loan. To mitigate the lender’s risk, the FHA supplies insurance on the loan (which the borrower pays for, typically wrapped into their monthly mortgage payments).</p>\n<p>As of now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FHA-backed loans for single-family residences are still being financed.</li>\n<li>FHA home equity conversion mortgages (also called “reverse mortgages”) are NOT being financed.</li>\n<li>FHA Title I loans for home improvement projects are NOT being financed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>So if you’re looking for an FHA-backed mortgage to buy a home, you should still be able to secure it during the government shutdown.</strong></p>\n<p>There are two big caveats here, though: first, while the FHA is still operating, it is not currently fully staffed, so securing a loan may take more time than usual because <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/list/the-shutdowns-impact-on-financial-services\">backlogs are forming</a>.</p>\n<p>Second: there’s more to buying a home than securing a mortgage. Read on for how the shutdown might affect government branches responsible for mortgage-adjacent duties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vamortgageloans\">VA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also offers mortgage guarantees – in this case for those who have served or are serving in the military. As of this writing, <a href=\"https://www.veteransunited.com/valoans/government-shutdown-impact-va-home-loans/\">VA-backed loans are still available to eligible borrowers</a>.</p>\n<p>As with FHA loans, though, system backlogs may mean these loans will take longer than usual to secure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usdamortgageloans\">USDA Mortgage Loans</h3>\n<p>USDA loans, sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and available to low- and middle-income Americans in rural areas, are <strong>NOT</strong> being processed during the shutdown. While homebuyers can still apply for USDA loans, their applications won’t be processed until Trump signs a bill renewing appropriations (money) for the USDA.</p>\n<p>If you were approved for a USDA loan but haven’t yet actually finalized your home purchase, you may be out of luck, especially if you’ve already spent money on appraisals and <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-4-point-insurance-inspection/\">inspections</a>. If you’re not sure of your loan’s status, consult with your lender.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rippleeffectsofgovernmentshutdownonmortgagelending\">Ripple Effects of Government Shutdown on Mortgage Lending</h2>\n<p>The takeaway from the above section is that the 2019 government shutdown will not <em>directly</em> affect most people’s mortgage loans.</p>\n<p>But it may have some indirect effects.</p>\n<p>Consider the warning that Moody’s Investor Service <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/Pages/rr005_0.aspx?bd=005006&ed=&rd=005006%7C004003%7C007035&tb=5&po=0&sb=&sd=&lang=en&cy=global&kw=\">issued on January 10</a>, which proclaimed, “Government shutdown raises non-bank mortgage lenders’ exposure to mortgage delivery risk.”</p>\n<p>Essentially, the Moody’s argument is that, of the 800,000 federal workers currently furloughed, some were responsible for work related to originating and servicing mortgage loans. Without their work, lenders must find workarounds to verify certain lender information – something that’s part of evaluating the risk the lender takes on when lending money.</p>\n<p>These workarounds, Moody’s points out, are likely to be less reliable and more susceptible to fraud than the established standard methods, meaning that, even though lenders still <em>can</em> complete mortgage loans, they may be less motivated to do so given the higher risk exposure they now face.</p>\n<p>The shutdown may also cause a few other problems for homebuyers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delayed income verification.</strong> Usually, borrowers provide income verification to mortgage lenders with the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf\">4605-T form</a> (named for its place in the tax code), which is a request for a borrower’s tax return. The IRS is in charge of processing these forms and sending the tax returns to mortgage lenders. While the IRS has been partially reopened since January 7, its employees face a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/01/09/irs-takes-steps-provide-tax-transcripts-other-services-during-government-shutdown/#d0586f865dae\">backlog of requests</a>. So while the income verification process usually takes about 72 hours, it could take much longer until the government reopens.</li>\n<li><strong>Delayed SSN verification.</strong> Mortgage lenders may also need to verify a borrower’s Social Security Number (SSN) as part of the mortgage underwriting process. Again, limited staffing at the SSA could lead to backlogs, which could delay the mortgage lending process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/01/09/irs-takes-steps-provide-tax-transcripts-other-services-during-government-shutdown/#d0586f865dae\">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/guide/bulletins/pdf/bll1901.pdf\">Freddie Mac</a> issued guidelines in early January for mortgage lenders during the shutdown. Essentially, both groups (which purchase mortgages from lenders and repackage them into mortgage-backed securities to create greater liquidity in the lending market) said it’s still okay to continue issuing mortgage loans, but lenders (and therefore borrowers) should expect the process to take longer than usual.</p>\n<p>Again, though, there’s a big caveat: both groups noted that their guidelines were meant only for a short-term shutdown. If the shutdown becomes a “long-term” affair (though neither group defines what counts as “long-term”), their guidelines may change.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on January 16, just five days after publishing its first guidelines, Fannie Mae issued updated <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/content/announcement/ll1902.pdf\">guidelines</a> for lenders. These require mortgage borrowers to have at least two months’ worth of “reserves” in savings. That means enough money in savings to make monthly mortgage payments (plus home insurance, HOA dues, and anything else house-related) for two months or whatever amount is required by the firm’s <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/content/eligibility_information/eligibility-matrix.pdf\">Eligibility Matrix</a> – whichever amount is higher.</p>\n<p>In other words: thanks to the shutdown, it just got a little harder to secure a mortgage loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodinsuranceduringthegovernmentshutdown\">Flood Insurance During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"/blog/check-your-flood-risk/\">flood zone</a>, you probably already know that most lenders require you to have an active flood insurance policy in place in order to issue a loan. In many cases, lenders require that this insurance be provided by the <a href=\"/blog/what-happens-to-the-nfip-in-a-government-shutdown/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP), which operates as part of FEMA.</p>\n<p>The good news: the NFIP <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program/national-flood-insurance-program-reauthorization-guidance\">announced</a> on December 28, 2018, that <strong>it will be issuing new flood insurance policies and renewing existing policies through May 31, 2019</strong>, regardless of the status of the rest of the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: That’s a reversal of an earlier statement that the NFIP wouldn’t be issuing policies.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the NFIP isn’t exactly in the best shape right now. All kinds of folks have been calling for a revamp of the program, which is in more than $20 billion of debt. We’ll keep you posted here about how things shake out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femadisasterassistanceduringthegovernmentshutdown\">FEMA Disaster Assistance During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinates disaster assistance to Americans impacted by disasters like <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> and wildfires. <strong>During the 2019 government shutdown, FEMA plans to continue delivering its disaster relief services</strong>, which is possible because they’re paid for from a fund that isn’t affected by the shutdown.</p>\n<p>If you need to apply for disaster assistance, go straight to <a href=\"https://www.disasterassistance.gov/\">DisasterAssistance.gov</a>, which will be fully operational during the shutdown.</p>\n<p>But while the most visible recovery efforts are moving forward, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/685880550/shutdown-threatens-to-stall-recovery-in-wildfire-ravaged-paradise-calif\">NPR has reported</a> that some other efforts have stalled. Disaster recovery grants funded by the Economic Development Administration (within the Department of Commerce), for example, are inaccessible. People can’t apply for them and money can’t be distributed.</p>\n<p>Another troubling development: prescribed burning work (meant to prevent future fires) has also been paused while federal workers are furloughed.</p>\n<p>While neither of these is causing much immediate pain, their long-term fallout could be significant for homeowners in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hudservicesduringthegovernmentshutdown\">HUD Services During the Government Shutdown</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, 95 percent of workers in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are furloughed during the current shutdown. While HUD primarily provides services for renters, it also offers loans and grants to elderly and low-income homeowners who need to make home upgrades or repairs for safety or health reasons.</p>\n<p>EfficientGov has put together a comprehensive list of what to expect from <a href=\"https://efficientgov.com/blog/2019/01/09/hud-in-the-government-shutdown/\">HUD during the shutdown</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other2019governmentshutdownconsiderationsforhomeowners\">Other 2019 Government Shutdown Considerations for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/reports/federal-government-shutdown-survey\">survey</a> conducted by the National Association of Realtors found that about one in five realtors saw the government shutdown affecting either current or potential clients (i.e., current or future home buyers). Those effects are likely to worsen the longer the shutdown continues.</p>\n<p>If you are a government employee who isn’t receiving a paycheck right now, consider <strong>approaching your lender sooner rather than later</strong> if you think you may miss mortgage payments. Already, several banks and credit unions around the country have announced plans to offer low-cost loans to borrowers affected by the shutdown. Some may also offer forbearance plans.</p>\n<p>Obviously, none of these options are ideal, but getting in touch with your lender before you actually miss a payment is usually the best way to ensure that you don’t face any penalties.</p>\n<p>If you still have questions about your mortgage, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, mortgage insurance, HOA fees, or other home-related obligations during the shutdown, feel free to reach out (<a href=\"mailto:support@kin.com\">support@kin.com</a>).

      title: "How Are Floodplains Determined?"
      body: "<p>After Hurricane Harvey, flooding hit a lot of <a href=\"/home-insurance/texas/\">Texas</a> homeowners who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/houston-flood-zone-hurricane-harvey.html\">didn’t know they were in a floodplain</a> – or rather, it hit homeowners who’d been told their homes weren’t in floodplains. The water damage posed a major problem because many of these people didn’t carry <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Harvey’s damage, as well as the widespread <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">damage from hurricanes</a> Irma and Maria, has left people wondering how floodplains are determined for homeowners – and when a person should think about supplementing their homeowners insurance with flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inthebeginningfemasbasefloodmaps\">In the Beginning: FEMA’s “Base Flood” Maps</h2>\n<p>When the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) launched as a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (<a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">FEMA</a>) in 1968, its goal was to provide a more robust insurance system for flooding that affected houses. Part of this effort involved requiring homeowners to purchase NFIP flood insurance if they lived in what was designated a “flood zone.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who lives in a Special Flood Hazard Area is required to carry flood insurance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The NFIP considers a “flood zone” to be any area that has a one percent chance of flooding in any given year. This one-percent chance is more commonly referred to in terms of the “hundred-year flood,” a name that many consider confusing. In fact, to prevent any confusion, the NFIP doesn’t use the term “hundred-year flood;” instead, it uses “<a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/pdf/floodplain/nfip_sg_unit_3.pdf\">base flood</a>.”</p>\n<p>If your house is located in a base flood zone (that is, in an area that has a one-percent chance of flooding in any given year), that zone is called a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Anyone who lives in an SFHA is required to carry flood insurance.</p>\n<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"inaccuratemapsinsufficientfundingandprivatehelp\">Inaccurate Maps, Insufficient Funding, and Private Help</h2>\n<p>The only problem was that the maps the NFIP used to determine who was in an SFHA were widely considered inaccurate. That was problematic for two major reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People living in SFHAs that were marked as “safe” weren’t required to buy flood insurance. When floods inevitably happened, the damage was wildly expensive.</li>\n<li>People living in “safe” areas incorrectly marked as SFHAs had to pay as much as 10 times what they should have for their flood insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was this second group who ended up making the biggest fuss about the incorrect maps. In the 1980s, enough citizens complained that the NFIP decided to let private parties submit changes to the flood maps. Ideally, the NFIP would have handled these changes itself, but the organization was already suffering from insufficient funding (today, it’s about $24.6 billion in debt. Yikes).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As many as 41 million people are at inland flooding risk, compared to the 13 million FEMA currently estimates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, a lot of submitted changes came from engineers working on behalf of private citizens who were tired of paying thousands of dollars for flood insurance they didn’t really need. But then developers realized that they could make some serious money by changing SFHAs to areas where it was safe to build (and sell) homes.</p>\n<p>While many of these changes were no doubt accurate, others were… well, less so. Reports suggest that in the Houston area in particular, developers were doing things like trucking in dirt to raise the elevation of land by a few inches, adding levees, digging water retention ponds, and more. The result was that the land could technically be considered out of an SFHA – but in reality, it was still susceptible to flooding from nearby water bodies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newfloodmapsbiggerrisks\">New Flood Maps, Bigger Risks?</h2>\n<p>The New York Times reports that more than 150,000 changes have been made to floodplain maps in the last five years, many proposed by private entities and approved by FEMA. But a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180228112520.htm\">study</a> published as recently as last month suggests that current maps could be seriously underestimating the number of <a href=\"/blog/flood-disclosure-laws/\">Americans at risk for flooding</a>.</p>\n<p>The reason: the new study mapped all of the continental United States, whereas the NFIP maps consider only 60 percent. With the entire landmass taken into account, as many as 41 million people are at inland flooding risk, compared to the 13 million FEMA currently estimates (both of these numbers ignore coastal flooding risks).</p>\n<h2 id=\"soshouldyougetfloodinsurance\">So… Should You Get Flood Insurance?</h2>\n<p>All this may be interesting, but it doesn’t necessarily answer the question of whether an individual homeowner should add flood insurance to their policy. If you’re on the fence, here are a few steps you can take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read through</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/homeowners-frequently-asked-questions\"><strong>FEMA’s FAQs on flood insurance</strong></a>. They cover a lot of practical ground.</li>\n<li><strong>Price out some flood insurance quotes</strong>. Even if you’re not legally required to have it, coverage may make sense given the way climate change is impacting the intensity of storms.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your home</strong>. Whether or not you’re in an SFHA, shoring up your property against the biggest local hazards makes sense.</li>\n</ol>"

      title: "How Are Hurricanes Named?"
      body: "<p>Hurricanes are named so that they are easy to remember and communicate. But it wasn’t always that way.</p>\n<p>Way back when, tropical storms were named after Catholic saints being honored on the day of the storm. For example, in 1825, the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico was named after Saint Anne.</p>\n<p>Storms from there were named pretty arbitrarily. A 1842 Atlantic storm was named <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/natural-hazards-and-disaster-risk-reduction/tropical-cyclones/Naming\">Antje’s hurricane</a> after it ripped off the mast of a boat by that name.</p>\n<p>Then early meteorologists in the US started naming storms by their latitude and longitude. Very scientific, but it doesn’t really roll off the tongue. Imagine trying to remember a string of numbers during the panic and confusion of an oncoming storm!</p>\n<p>The US also experimented with using the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\">phonetic alphabet for storms</a> (Able, Baker, Charlie), but that led to overlap and confusion.</p>\n<p>During World War II, inspired by George R. Stewart’s novel <em>Storm</em>, military meteorologists in the Pacific jokingly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tropical_cyclone_naming\">started naming storms after their wives and girlfriends</a>. While not the most flattering thing in the world, it turned out human names are much easier to remember.</p>\n<p>And the naming convention stuck. Hurricane names keep everyone on the same page during <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> and increase public awareness, from meteorologists, researchers, and emergency responders to reporters and citizens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdohurricanesgettheirnames\">How Do Hurricanes Get Their Names?</h2>\n<p>The National Weather Service started using women’s names for storms in 1953, and by 1978, both men and women’s names for Northern Pacific storms were in rotation (hooray, equality!). The system was so successful that by 1979, Atlantic storms got this naming convention, too.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/natural-hazards-and-disaster-risk-reduction/tropical-cyclones/Naming\">World Meteorological Organization now maintains a list of names</a> to use for storms. Women’s and men’s names alternate throughout the year in alphabetical order. There are 21 names each year, and names can be repeated after six years unless they are retired out of respect. So the 2020 hurricane names will be used again in 2026.</p>\n<p>WMO members of each region propose names for Atlantic and Eastern Pacific storms, and they’re approved each year. Some areas, like the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-cyclone/Naming-systems\">northern Indian Ocean</a>, give tropical cyclones numbers instead of names.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricanenamesinorder\">Hurricane Names in Order</h2>\n<p>Below are the 2020, 2021, and 2022 tropical storm names. If more than 21 tropical storms happen in any given year, the additional storms will take their names from the Greek alphabet in order: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi, and Omega.</p>\n<p>The last time we dipped into the Greek alphabet was in 2005 when the Atlantic had <a href=\"https://time.com/5696288/hurricane-names/\">27 recorded hurricanes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2021atlantichurricanenames\">2021 Atlantic Hurricane Names</h3>\n<p>Atlantic hurricane names are assigned in alphabetical order. None of the 21 names begin with Q, U, X, Y, or Z.</p>\n<p>The names this season are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ana</li>\n<li>Bill</li>\n<li>Claudette</li>\n<li>Danny</li>\n<li>Elsa</li>\n<li>Fred</li>\n<li>Grace</li>\n<li>Henri</li>\n<li>Ida</li>\n<li>Julian</li>\n<li>Kate</li>\n<li>Larry</li>\n<li>Mindy</li>\n<li>Nicholas</li>\n<li>Odette</li>\n<li>Peter</li>\n<li>Rose</li>\n<li>Sam</li>\n<li>Teresa</li>\n<li>Victor</li>\n<li>Wanda</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml\"><em>National Hurricane Center</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"2021easternnorthpacifichurricanenames\">2021 Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Names</h3>\n<p>Two centers assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization in the Eastern North Pacific: the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, depending on the direction of the storm. There are more Spanish names on the Eastern Pacific hurricanes list because these storms mostly threaten western Mexico and Central America. The list has 24 names but none that begin with Q or U.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Andres</li>\n<li>Blanca</li>\n<li>Carlos</li>\n<li>Dolores</li>\n<li>Enrique</li>\n<li>Felicia</li>\n<li>Guillermo</li>\n<li>Hilda</li>\n<li>Ignacio</li>\n<li>Jimena</li>\n<li>Kevin</li>\n<li>Linda</li>\n<li>Marty</li>\n<li>Nora</li>\n<li>Olaf</li>\n<li>Pamela</li>\n<li>Rick</li>\n<li>Sandra</li>\n<li>Terry</li>\n<li>Vivian</li>\n<li>Waldo</li>\n<li>Xina</li>\n<li>York</li>\n<li>Zelda</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml\"><em>National Hurricane Center</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"retiredhurricanenames\">Retired Hurricane Names</h2>\n<p>Names are retired from the WMO lists when a storm causes significant fatalities and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane damage</a>. It’s a small way to show respect to the folks who’ve lost a lot. So far, 89 names have been retired.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, Nate, Florence, and Michael have all been retired. Andrew and Katrina are also retired and won’t be used again. <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml\">See the full list of retired names here</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the name Dorian was retired, and in 2020, Laura, Eta, and Iota were retired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoesastormgetaname\">When Does a Storm Get a Name?</h2>\n<p>When a tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean reaches 39 miles per hour in wind speed, it gets a name, like Tropical Storm Isaias. Once it reaches sustained winds of 74 miles per hour, it’s upgraded to hurricane status with that same name: Hurricane Isaias.</p>\n<p>Even if a tropical storm doesn’t become a hurricane, the name won’t be used again for six years. The next storm takes the next name on the list.</p>"

      title: "How does mortgage interest work?"
      body: "<p>Most homebuyers need a mortgage before they can afford a house. But like anyone who borrows money, people who take out a mortgage end up paying the amount they borrowed plus more in interest.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage interest can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Let’s take a closer look at how mortgage interest works on different loans and what might be the best option for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisamortgageinterestrate\">What is a mortgage interest rate?</h2>\n<p>A mortgage interest rate is what it costs you to borrow money so you can buy a home. Lenders typically charge a percentage of the principal amount, or the amount you’re borrowing, as interest. This is how they make money on your loan.</p>\n<p>Your mortgage interest rate is different from your annual percentage rate (APR). An APR includes your mortgage interest rate plus any discount points and broker fees. For this reason, your APR is often higher than your mortgage rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesinterestworkonamortgage\">How does interest work on a mortgage?</h2>\n<p>How mortgage interest works depends on the type of mortgage you get. Generally, you have three types of loans to choose from when you buy a home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed-rate mortgage</li>\n<li>Adjustable-rate mortgage</li>\n<li>Interest-only mortgage</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most common type is a fixed-rate mortgage followed by an adjustable-rate mortgage. Interest-only loans are much rarer than these and usually only given to homebuyers who are wealthy or who have irregular incomes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fixedinterestratemortgage\">Fixed-interest rate mortgage</h3>\n<p>A fixed-interest rate mortgage is one where your interest rate is set for the entire life of the loan. Mortgages typically last anywhere from 10 to 30 years, or even longer. Choosing a mortgage with a shorter term can increase your monthly payments because the loan needs to be repaid sooner, but your mortgage interest rates may be lower than it is on longer-term mortgages.</p>\n<p>Your monthly mortgage payment goes towards paying off your loan’s interest and principal. In the early months, a larger chunk of your payment goes towards your interest than to your principal. But as time passes, your principal decreases and accrues less interest. This means more of your monthly payment can go to paying off your principal.</p>\n<p>You should also note that while the mortgage interest on a fixed-rate loan doesn’t change, you may get a chance to <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinance your mortgage</a> at a different rate. This requires you to apply and requalify for the lower mortgage interest rate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjustableratemortgage\">Adjustable-rate mortgage</h3>\n<p>An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) does not permanently lock in your mortgage interest rate for the duration of your loan. Instead, the mortgage interest rates on ARMs can adjust as often as once per year, but most have limits on how often or how much they can adjust.</p>\n<p>Like a fixed-interest rate mortgage, ARMS can have a term of up to 30 years and your monthly payments go towards paying off your principal and your interest. Borrowers find ARMs attractive because they often start with a low interest rate that makes them more affordable in the early years. But you may find your monthly payments difficult to maintain as interest rates change.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid this trouble is to look at how often an ARMs adjusts. For example, the mortgage interest rate on a three-year ARM can adjust every three years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interestonlymortgage\">Interest-only mortgage</h3>\n<p>Unlike the monthly payment for ARMs and fixed-interest rate mortgages, the monthly payment for an interest-only mortgage only goes towards your interest at the start of the loan. This keeps your payments low for a set time. Once the interest-only period ends, you're responsible for paying both the principal and the interest.</p>\n<p>If you’re not planning on staying in the home for a long time, an interest-only mortgage can make it easier for you to afford a pricier home. However, this is still a risky mortgage to take on because you don’t build up equity until you start paying your principal. Worse? You can lose any equity you gained from your down payment if housing prices suddenly decline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howismortgageinterestcalculated\">How is mortgage interest calculated?</h2>\n<p>Lenders calculate mortgage interest by the month. To get a general idea of your monthly payment, you multiply the remaining principal on your loan by your interest rate and divide that resulting number by 12.</p>\n<p>If you want a more accurate estimate for your monthly mortgage interest, you can try one of the many mortgage calculators available online. This {{< external-link url=\"https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/\" text=\"mortgage calculator\" >}}mortgage calculator not only gives you an estimate for your monthly payment, but it also factors in other costs like <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, property taxes, and <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a>.</p>"

      title: "How long do roofs last? | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>The life span of your roof depends on the materials that it’s made from and how the climate impacts those materials. Some roofing materials are more resilient than others, but most people can expect approximately 10 to 15 years from a roof made of 3-tab shingles. More expensive materials such as slate can last up to 25 years, depending on maintenance and where you live.</p>\n<p>It's important to know the age of your roof because it impacts your home insurance premiums. The more life you have left in your roof, the lower your rates will usually be.</p>\n<p>That's because your roof offers key protection for the rest of your home from the elements. A <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof that needs to be replaced</a> can easily lead to losses from water intrusion –&nbsp;and more.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that insurance carriers in different regions sometimes have strict roof age requirements. For example, Florida's climate can shorten a roof's lifespan, and most insurers take that into account during <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at different roofing materials, how weather affects their durability, and what you can expect to pay for them per square (i.e.,100 square feet).</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesa3tabrooflast\">How long does a 3-tab roof last?</h3>\n<p>Because they’re inexpensive and easy to install, 3-tab shingles are some of the most common roofing materials and are found on all <a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">types of roofs</a>. Depending on where you are, you may find warranties of up to 25 years for a 3-tab roof. However, the average 3-tab roof lasts about 12 to 15 years in a mild climate. In severe weather areas such as California and Florida, that drops to seven to 10 years. This is the result of harsh winds and a beating sun taking its toll on the shingles.</p>\n<p>Each 3-tab shingle is made of asphalt that forms a watertight seal over the house and has mineral granules laid on top for color and durability. The cost ranges from $70 to $150 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesanarchitecturalshinglerooflast\">How long does an architectural shingle roof last?</h3>\n<p>Like 3-tab shingles, architectural shingles are made from asphalt; however, they are more durable than their 3-tab counterparts. Their average life span is between 25 and 30 years, but again, severe weather conditions may reduce that to 10 to 12 years.</p>\n<p>Architectural shingles have a similar composition to 3-tabs, but they’re heavier, which is why they’re more durable. Additionally, architectural shingles aren’t flat so they can mimic more expensive <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">roofing materials</a>. Ultimately, they’re considered a more high-end roofing material. and cost you anywhere from $250 to $400 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesametalrooflast\">How long does a metal roof last?</h3>\n<p>Metal roofs are usually made from aluminum or steel and are particularly popular in hurricane-prone areas. They have a life span of 20 to 50 years with warranties in the 20 year range, although durability does vary based on the material. Lesser quality metal roofs made from thinner metals (26 to 29 gauge) usually have a shorter life span of up to 20 years.</p>\n<p>The type and the thickness of the metal also impacts price. A roof made of aluminum or steel might cost $115 per square, but one made of copper or stone-coated steel may cost up to $900 per square.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesaclaytilerooflast\">How long does a clay tile roof last?</h3>\n<p>Clay roof tiles, most commonly seen as terracotta tiles popular on Southwest homes, do well in hot, sunny conditions and resist rot. While they can start showing their age in 15 to 20 years in Florida, most come with a warranty of at least 30 years. They can last 50 years or longer in ideal conditions.</p>\n<p>The per square cost of clay tiles is around $600 to $800. But once installed, there is little maintenance required for a long-lasting roof. Please note, however, that clay tiles are heavy, so they aren’t the right choice for every home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesawoodrooflast\">How long does a wood roof last?</h3>\n<p>Wood roofs come in two types: rustic shakes and machine-cut shingles. Neither are as practical as more modern materials like asphalt – particularly in hot, humid climates – but many people find them aesthetically pleasing. In fact, other materials are often made to look like wood.</p>\n<p>Wood roofs last about 30 years when perfectly maintained. The more realistic estimate is around 10 years, and that may be even shorter in coastal regions. They can cost anywhere from $250 to $600 per square for shingles and as much as $900 for wood shakes. Both fare well against hurricane winds, but they require a lot of maintenance. You need to inspect a wood roof annually for rot and warped or split shingles that could affect water resistance. Damaged shingles need to be replaced immediately to maintain the integrity of the roof.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesaslaterooflast\">How long does a slate roof last?</h3>\n<p>A slate roof is about the highest-end roof you can get with the longest life span. A properly installed slate roof can last up to 100 years and can withstand most weather conditions including sun, heat, and wind. They are perfect for locations such as Florida, Louisiana, and California where the elements can wreak havoc on a roof.</p>\n<p>However, you pay a hefty price for such durability. The average cost of a slate roof is between $600 and $1,500 per square. And remember, durability isn’t forever. Wear and tear continually weakens your roof, so you may have to replace it in just 25 years. That’s even more true for soft slate tiles.</p>\n<p>Plus, slate tiles are heavy, so your costs could go even higher if you have to reinforce your home’s framework to support the weight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoesbuiltuproofinglast\">How long does built-up roofing last?</h3>\n<p>Built-up roofing is most often used on low-pitch and flat roofs. They consist of a series of asphalt and ply sheet layers on top of a cover board and insulation and a final reflective cap sheet made of minerals or a covering of asphalt and gravel. Not only does this make for excellent waterproofing, but flat roofs usually stand up to hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>Built-up roofs can last as long as 40 years and often come with warranties between 15 and 30 years. This life span is a little shorter than some other types of roofing materials, but built-up roofings is often one of the only options for flat roofs. Luckily, built-ups are easy to maintain and inexpensive, costing anywhere from $250 to $400 per square.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongdoroofslastinfloridaandlouisiana\">How long do roofs last in Florida and Louisiana?</h2>\n<p>How long your roof lasts in the hurricane-prone states of Florida and Louisiana depends on the type of roof that you have. Roofs take a heavier beating and don’t last as long in these states. For example, a 3-tab roof’s lifespan drops to around seven to 10 years while architectural shingles may only last 10 to 12 years. Higher quality roofs such as clay tiles can do well against hurricane conditions, keeping a life expectancy of up to 20 years.</p>\n<p>No matter what type of roofing material you have, you need to look into wind mitigation. Taking a few simple steps to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">hurricane-proof your home</a> goes a long way to keeping you and your family safe.</p>"

      title: "How many people are moving to Florida?"
      body: "<p>For all the warnings we hear about the threat of rising sea levels and intensifying hurricanes, few seem to be using that information when it comes to finding a place to live. Nothing makes this clearer than when you look at how many people are moving to Florida. Last year, the state saw nearly 600 new residents per day.</p>\n<p>That’s right, <em>per day</em>!</p>\n<p>You can hardly blame anyone for wanting to live in Florida﹘the state does have phenomenal weather and no personal income tax. But the flip side of all those sunny days is the increased risk brought on by climate change. In this post, we take a look at how many people picked the Sunshine State and what they need to know about climate risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridaspopularitybythenumbers\">Florida’s popularity by the numbers</h2>\n<p>Florida has always been a popular location for people looking to put down roots. In fact, it’s among {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2021/census-2020-data-results.html\" text=\"13 states with the fastest population growth\" >}}, increasing by more than 14 percent in the last 10 year. Florida also joined Texas and Arizona at the top of the list for states with the largest net domestic migration gains, according to the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2021-population-estimates.html\" text=\"most recent census data\" >}}:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida: 220,890</li>\n<li>Texas: 170,307</li>\n<li>Arizona: 93,026</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This number is the difference between people moving in and people moving out. As you can see, Florida is by far the biggest winner by that measurement. Compare that to the states with the largest net domestic migration losses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California: -367,299</li>\n<li>New York: -352,185</li>\n<li>Illinois: -122,460</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can’t look at those numbers and draw conclusions about why people choose to settle down in Florida, but people often try. Some say that Californians and New Yorkers are trying to get away from high taxes or that Illinoisans are escaping brutal winter weather. All of these are just guesses.</p>\n<p>However, we do know one thing. At least one major report shows the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">clock is ticking on climate change</a>, and that means people buying homes in Florida may be taking on more risk than they anticipated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasingclimaterisksdontdeterhomebuyers\">Increasing climate risks don’t deter homebuyers</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">Climate change affects your home</a> in several ways, but one of the biggest is your exposure to risk. For some Floridians, rising oceans mean their homes now sit just below sea level. Others are more likely to suffer wind damage and flooding from the increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>But as census data shows, these realities aren’t causing people to think twice about living in Florida. Moreover, only <a href=\"/blog/where-to-buy-property-climate-change/\">48 percent of homebuyers don’t consider climate change</a> when deciding on a home.</p>\n<p>Long story short, human behavior is hard to change, and people are ultimately going to live in places that bring them joy. The real question is: how can we make them safer wherever they land?</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhomefromclimaterisks\">How to protect your home from climate risks</h2>\n<p>When it comes to protecting your home from climate change, knowledge is power. You want to know what your risks are so you can reduce their impact. We’ve found a couple of tools that help with this.</p>\n<p>The first is the {{< external-link url=\"https://hazards.fema.gov/nri\" text=\"National Risk Index\" >}} from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It scores communities on their risk for 18 natural disasters, including coastal flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes, and includes data for community resiliency and expected annual losses. Another useful tool comes from {{< external-link url=\"https://floodfactor.com\" text=\"Flood Factor\" >}}, a free online application that incorporates data about our changing environment to determine a property’s flood risk.</p>\n<p>Once you know what perils you’re exposed to, you can reinforce your property against them. For a Florida homeowner on the coast, that may mean adding <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a> to your roof or taking other steps to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">hurricane-proof your home</a>. Homeowners more inland, however, may want to learn about <a href=\"/blog/wildfires-in-florida/\">protecting properties from wildfires</a>.</p>\n<p>Another key step in protecting your home? Knowing what your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> covers. For example, home insurance typically covers wind damage, but water damage from floods is almost always excluded. If flooding is common in your area, then you may want to look at adding <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy.</p>\n<p>Not sure if all your risks are covered?

      title: "How to Become a Landlord"
      url: "/blog/how-to-become-a-landlord/"
      body: "<p>Most folks want to become a landlord because they’ve heard it’s a good financial opportunity. Investment properties are typically easy to finance, and with the right planning, they can be pretty profitable.</p>\n<p>But being a landlord is also a lot of responsibility and not necessarily for the faint of heart.</p>\n<p>So your first step is to figure out what the role entails and whether it’s the right fit for you. That’s where we can help. We talked to real estate experts for their pointers on how to become a successful landlord. Here’s what they said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1findtherightlocation\">1. Find the Right Location</h2>\n<p>Location is everything in real estate, and that’s true for rental properties, too. Bill Samuel, a <a href=\"http://www.blueladderdevelopment.com\">real estate developer</a>, explains that being a landlord is a business and you need to approach it that way.</p>\n<p>“Getting great tenants starts with having a good property in a good location,” Samuel says. “Good tenants want to live in clean properties in safe areas.”</p>\n<p>Research the communities where you plan on owning a property. Get an idea of why tenants want to move to the area. Is it close to a business district or universities?</p>\n<p>Next, take a look at the range of rentals in the area. A bigger, updated home will generate more rent than a smaller one that needs work. Estimate what your revenue will be based on the type of investment you make.</p>\n<p>Start taking note of how much property in the area costs so you can build your budget or plan for a loan. Based on rental rates, you might decide that a smaller home will give you a better return on your investment even if you can afford a bigger property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2understandlandlordtenantlaws\">2. Understand Landlord-Tenant Laws</h2>\n<p>Research the landlord-tenant laws in your state and county. You’ll want to know what tenants’ rights are, what your obligations are as a landlord, and the process for eviction if necessary.</p>\n<p>This part of your assessment can’t be understated. Being a landlord is a big responsibility, and your tenants are entitled to a safe and well-maintained home. You’ll need to make sure the property meets state and county guidelines regarding habitability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3setabudget\">3. Set a Budget</h2>\n<p>You already did research on the area and know property values and probable rents. Now it’s time to crunch the numbers and set a budget for yourself. Setting a budget requires more than just looking at a prospective mortgage.</p>\n<p>“Most issues can be resolved with enough liquidity. Keep your house in order and ensure you have enough reserves to cover unexpected issues,” Edward Briggs of HomeReviews explains. “This also puts you in a prime position if new investment opportunities arise.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to the purchase, think about the mortgage, closing costs, and any upfront capital needed for repairs to get the house up to rental standards. Don’t forget to consider other expenses associated with being a landlord, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage cost.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li>Property insurance.</li>\n<li>City licensing, mandatory inspections, and annual registration fees.</li>\n<li>Utilities.</li>\n<li>Rental income taxes.</li>\n<li>Maintenance costs.</li>\n<li>Marketing and advertising fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the work you choose to outsource, you may also have to factor in the cost of a bookkeeper, property manager, and attorney to help draw up your lease or offer guidance on disputes.</p>\n<p>Make sure the income you can charge for a property is enough to cover all expenses, including taxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4buyaproperty\">4. Buy a Property</h2>\n<p>Once you have an idea of costs and potential income, it’s time to find your investment property. Your budget should dictate how big or expensive the property is. This is a business decision, so don’t get bogged down in negotiations that make the property more expensive. Keep the budget in mind at all times when making an offer on a property and securing it.</p>\n<p>When you go through the escrow process, take advantage of all the inspections you can. You’ll want to have a good idea of the property’s condition, including the lifespan of its appliances and systems. You don’t want to buy a money trap that suddenly needs a new refrigerator or brand-new plumbing if you didn’t initially budget for it.</p>\n<p>Go back to your budget and update the numbers based on the actual value and expected costs of the property you’re buying. You’ll be able to get exact data on property taxes, insurance, and any licensing fees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5getlandlordinsurance\">5. Get Landlord Insurance</h2>\n<p>Your mortgage lender usually won’t let you close the loan without the right property insurance in place. Even if your rental property is a single-family detached home, you still need landlord insurance for it, not <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. That’s because you’re protecting the structure and your tenants need to protect their own belongings inside.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">Landlord insurance</a> is a type of dwelling fire policy, also called a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>. And luckily for you, you can get affordable landlord insurance with us. Get a quote in minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6preparetheproperty\">6. Prepare the Property</h2>\n<p>Remember, your property must meet an implied warranty of habitability in almost every state. In Florida, that means basic structural elements must be intact, including floors, stairs, walls, roofs, etc. Common areas must be maintained and free of hazards. Electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems must be operating safely. And it’s your responsibility to handle pests.</p>\n<p>After you close on the property, make sure it’s ready to live in. Take care of any repairs and give the property a deep clean so it’s ready for staging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7settherentalprice\">7. Set the Rental Price</h2>\n<p>Revisit your research to determine the rental price you’ll charge. Remember that the rental price needs to be more than the mortgage amount to cover additional expenses, like taxes and insurance. That said, you do want to keep the price competitive so the property rents quickly and attracts good tenants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8markettheproperty\">8. Market the Property</h2>\n<p>Take high-resolution, well-lit pictures of the property to use in your marketing materials. Write an enticing description of the property that highlights its best features, whether that’s the pool in the backyard, the large windows that let natural light in, or its recent renovations.</p>\n<p>Upload your photos and description on rental property websites like Zillow, Rentals, or Trulia.</p>\n<p>Another great way to market the property is to ask for referrals, especially if you're expanding from one property to multiple properties.</p>\n<p>“Leads are a dime a dozen, but for us, nothing beats referrals from our best tenants. Tenants who sign a lease through a referral stay longer and are generally great fits for the community because they already know someone in the building who had a positive enough experience to refer them,” Mike Catania, CEO of the referral program <a href=\"https://locar.is\">Locaris</a> explains. “Further, as vacancy rates are starting to climb from the economy's downturn, a referral from a great tenant makes an applicant with a lower credit score more attractive because someone we know is vouching for them.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"9screenprospectivetenants\">9. Screen Prospective Tenants</h2>\n<p>Create a process to screen potential tenants. Ideally, you budgeted to pay for credit checks and background services on potential candidates. But you may want to prescreen tenants so you don’t pay for each candidate.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, you could incorporate the credit check or background screening cost into an application fee so you don’t need to worry about it.</p>\n<p>Either way, make sure you get the right information before you sign a lease. Look for candidates with a solid work history, no criminal background, and good credit scores. Your application may also screen for things like pet breeds or a number of children that will be in the household.</p>\n<p>This is where knowing the laws is important. You may have a two-bedroom home and have an applicant with four children. That might not meet the city’s occupancy standards and you’ll need to decline the applicant.</p>\n<p>When screening tenants, use objective standards and comply with anti-discrimination laws like the <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_rights_and_obligations\">Fair Housing Act</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10signalease\">10. Sign a Lease</h2>\n<p>Never rent out your property without a fully executed lease. Get the lease signed and collect the deposit before you turn over the keys. Verbal agreements and handshakes won’t protect you if there’s a dispute.</p>\n<p>Your lease should clearly spell out the terms and conditions of the property, including rent due dates, late fees and penalties, exit terms, and grounds for eviction. Include a property inventory form that states what you provide (e.g., washer and dryer) and the condition of those things as well as the condition of the house. You’ll refer to this property inventory and walk-through form when the tenant leaves to determine how much, if any, of the security deposit is owed.</p>\n<p>The goal is to develop a good relationship of reasonable expectations from the start. The relationship will hopefully strengthen over time.</p>\n<p>“Good relationships can mean that repairs are done quickly and efficiently, payments come and go at a more efficient rate, and overall the experience is just better,” as Lucas Robinson, CMO of <a href=\"https://www.crediful.com/\">Crediful</a>, points out. “Welcome them with lots of respect and be nice to them. They are staying there for some time, so they should feel like this is their home, not somewhere they feel sad or unsafe.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"11maintaintheproperty\">11. Maintain the Property</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! You’re officially a landlord. Now the work of maintaining the property begins.</p>\n<p>You’ll want to have a good handyman in your contacts for all the little repairs that pop up, like fixing leaky faucets or installing weatherstripping. Keeping up with maintenance helps keep tenants happy, as Ethan Taub, CEO of Loanry, explains.</p>\n<p>“Those small fixes you leave for now could turn into something big if you ignore it for too long,” says Taub. “So when your tenants show you something, take it seriously and sort it out. That house will outlive their time in it, so you have to take good care of it for everyone who will stay there.”</p>\n<p>Not only is property maintenance important to keeping good tenants, but it also helps keep your property value up. Appreciation in the property can become a valuable asset, so do what you can to improve it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12considerhiringapropertymanager\">12. Consider Hiring a Property Manager</h2>\n<p>Being a landlord can be a lot. Tenants call at all hours when they need something. Rent is invariably hard to collect at times. Maintenance and repairs can take a lot of your time as you coordinate contractors and oversee repairs. If your budget allows for it, hiring a property manager could be a big help.</p>\n<p>Property managers take care of everything from tenant screening to collecting rent and dealing with those 2 a.m. emergency calls. If you want to be a hands-off landlord, a property manager could be right for you. While some property managers charge a flat rate, you can expect to pay between 8 and 12 percent of your net collected rent for a property manager.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more tips on [how to successfully rent and manage your property]().</p>"

      title: "How to budget after buying a house"
      body: "<p>It takes a lot of work to make a house a home. You may want to upgrade your kitchen, build a patio, or install hardwood floors. How to budget after buying a house to make that work – and to keep up with your bills and maintenance – can be a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makingahomeownersbudget\">Making a homeowners budget</h2>\n<p>It's easy to overspend without a homeowners budget. After <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">buying a house</a>, most folks need to fix up the house, account for family necessities, stay current on bills, and maybe even save a little for a rainy day. But even with a budget, it can be a challenge to stick to. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/10/11/the-average-american-overspends-by-nearly-7500-per.aspx\">79 percent of Americans</a> say they struggle to stick to their household budgets. Perhaps that's why <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/pf/expenses/index.html\">96 percent of people are stressed about money</a>.</p>\n<p>So let's fix that. Here, you'll get tips for creating a reasonable budget and some pointers on how to stick to it. Let's dive in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1analyzeyourspending\">1. Analyze your spending</h3>\n<p>Grab those paystubs, credit card statements, and bank statements, and get ready to take some notes. It's time to really sit down at look at where your money goes each month.</p>\n<p>Don't be surprised if you find a lot of non-essential spending in the mix. One <a href=\"https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/millennials-feel-the-most-pressure-to-spend-on-nonessentials-and-they-do\">survey found</a> adults spend an average of $697 every month on non-essentials; Millennials spend a monthly average of $838 on items some might consider extracurricular.</p>\n<p>That's not meant to spend shame! Non-essentials can be a much needed joy, and your budget should account for that. But the key is to know how much to allot this kind of spending so it doesn't get the better of you.</p>\n<p>A USA Today <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/07/americans-spend-thousands-on-nonessentials/39450207/\">report</a> breaks down some of our most common monthly spending habits when it comes to non-essential items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restaurant meals: $209.38</li>\n<li>Drinks: $188.68</li>\n<li>Takeout: $177. 88</li>\n<li>Buying lunch: $173.62</li>\n<li>Rideshares: $96.11</li>\n<li>Cable: $90.57</li>\n<li>Movie streaming: $23.09</li>\n<li>Music streaming: $22.41</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see there is some redundancy in those expenses, and that might help you decide which of these non-essentials are worth budgeting for and which can be trimmed in the service of helping you live more comfortably.</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you can opt for less expensive cable because you rely on streaming services for movies. Or maybe if you plan your work-lunches or evening meals in advance, you might be able to save an extra $50 a month.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Creating a budget is more than just allocating money to major areas of your household. It involves looking at spending habits and deciding which ones you want to change in order to save or put funds to better use.</p>\n<p>Make notes on what you currently spend and circle items you want to consider adjusting or eliminating from your monthly costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2learnthebasicsofmakingabudget\">2. Learn the basics of making a budget</h3>\n<p>When you start your budget, you'll first need to categorize your expenses to see what you absolutely need to spend to keep your household functioning, get to and from work, and pay for food and clothing for the family. It helps to think of these in terms of fixed expenses, variable expenses, and discretionary expenses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix expenses</strong> are things that don’t change from month to month, like your mortgage, insurance, car payments, and certain utilities (e.g., a cell phone or cable bill).</li>\n<li><strong>Variable expenses</strong> include things that change monthly, such as your water and electric bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Discretionary expenses</strong> include things like impulsive purchases – those amazing new shoes – or eating out because you were too tired to make dinner. As we touched on earlier, these expenses can quickly add up and eat into your overall monthly budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose the method you want to keep track of your budget: paper, a spreadsheet, or a budgeting program. Then create three columns: fixed expenses, variable household expenses, discretionary expenses. Write down the type of expense in each column with the amount. For variable expenses, add up a few months of bills to get a sense of the monthly average. For example, take three months of eating out (i.e $180, $235, $195), add them up and divide it by three ($203).</p>\n<p>Below is an example of monthly expenses and how they might be categorized.</p>\n<p>| Sample Monthly Budget |\n| --- |\n| Fixed Expenses |\n| Mortgage: $1,200 |\n| Car payment: $203 |\n| Home insurance premium: $90 |\n| Car insurance premium: $90 |\n| Cell phone: $290 |\n| TOTAL: $1,873 |</p>\n<p>The more detailed you can be with your spending, the easier it will be for you to determine what you can adjust. Notice how coffee is not part of eating out; it’s a category all on its own so you can assess what's necessary and what isn’t. You set the priorities.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the ultimate goal isn’t to restrict yourself from discretionary spending; it's to understand where your money goes so you can make informed adjustments.</p>\n<p>Once you add all the columns up, compare the total to your total household income. This is often an eye-opener for many folks. It isn’t uncommon to see yourself barely operating in the black or to see just how far into the red you go every month, putting the difference on <a href=\"/blog/home-renovation-on-credit-card/\">credit cards </a>that grow out of control.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3setasidefundsforhomemaintenanceorrepairs\">3. Set aside funds for home maintenance or repairs</h3>\n<p>Part of your budget should also account for <a href=\"/insurance-resources/home-maintenance-checklist/\">home maintenance </a>that don’t always come up every month or every year, but need to be addressed. This is especially important when budgeting for a new home. When something breaks, it often happens unexpectedly, and putting those repairs on credit cards could lead to cumbersome interest charges.</p>\n<p>If you can, set aside some funds each month to account for these maintenance or repair costs. To get an idea of what those expenses might look like, take a look at the chart below.</p>\n<p>| Typical Home Maintenance &amp; Repair Costs |\n| --- |\n| Repair Type |\n| HVAC |\n| Roof |\n| Water Heater |\n| Gutters |</p>\n<p><em>Source: Home Advisor</em></p>\n<p>Look at your bank statements or talk to someone you know who owns a house to brainstorm things that come up during the year that need maintenance. This can help you plan and save up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4planforthefuture\">4. Plan for the future</h3>\n<p>Beyond your monthly essentials, make sure you are putting money toward your future. Check your paycheck stubs to see how much you are contributing to retirement. You can put $19,500 in 2020 into an employer-sponsored 401(k) or retirement plan.</p>\n<p>If your employer matches some of those funds, that is more money toward your retirement. If you don’t have a 401(k), think about how much you can set aside for your future. You can contribute $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older) to an IRA. To max that out, you would need to contribute $500 to $584 each month.</p>\n<p>Beyond retirement, you may have debt that needs some attention. To pay down debt, try to make payments beyond the minimum, which usually just covers interest charges.</p>\n<p>And if you have children, it's probably smart to think about college sooner rather than later. Sallie Mae <a href=\"https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/tools/college-planning-calculator/\">reports</a> 85 percent of parents expect that their children will go to college, but only 40 percent of parents developing a plan to pay for it. Tuition costs vary widely depending on whether your child goes to an in-state public university, goes to an out-of-state university, or attends a private university. The average annual costs of a <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/student-loans/average-cost-of-college\">four-year university range from $25,290 to $50,900</a> between tuition and other expenses.</p>\n<p>If you plan on covering four years of college, take the university costs, multiple that by four years of school, and then divide that number by the number of years you have left to save before your child is college-age.</p>\n<p>For example, if you plan on an in-state university for your one-year-old:</p>\n<p><strong>[$25,290 x 4 years] / (18-1) = $5,950.59</strong></p>\n<p>That’s $5,950.59 a year that you have to save for 17 years to meet today’s college costs. That works out to $495.88 a month. Keep in mind that college costs typically go up and you can also explore investing that money to help it grow faster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5sticktoyourbudget\">5. Stick to your budget</h3>\n<p>A perfect budget only works if you stick to it. This is why we made the earlier note about discretionary spending. A budget should still allow you to enjoy life and your new home; it shouldn’t be so restrictive that you feel you can’t do anything.</p>\n<p>Remember that you qualified for the house based on your income and existing debt numbers. You’re in a good position to create a realistic budget that allows you to keep the household afloat while you save for long-term needs and enjoy life. But you might not be able to indulge every whim.</p>\n<p>This is where setting priorities comes in. All the costs that add up after your monthly expenses (retirement savings, home repairs, college funds) should be weighed against your discretionary spending. It’s one thing if you can do both without any sacrifices, but that isn't the reality for most Americans.</p>\n<p>Discretionary spending should not exceed <a href=\"https://www.discover.com/online-banking/banking-topics/budgeting-with-the-50-20-30-rule/\">30 percent of your monthly budget</a>. Even that can often be whittled down to put money toward better uses. Imagine if you cut your monthly takeout spending in half and used that money to save for an annual vacation.</p>\n<p>If you’re spending $177 on takeout and you manage to cut it to $88.50, that’s $1,062 dollars a year you just saved for a vacation.</p>\n<p>Once you have your priorities, plan each week so you can see them through. For example, if you’re eating takeout because you get home late after a gym class, plan ahead and cook extra the night before so you have leftovers waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Knowing why you are doing certain things with your homeowners budget is often enough to help you stick to it. And don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad week; refocus and get back to the plan. Doing so will put you in a much better position to succeed.</p>"

      title: "How to buy a house in a seller's market"
      body: "<p>Most of 2022 was what realtors call a seller's market. This means the number of available homes is low, but there are also a lot of people looking to buy. Together, these conditions usually increase competition, drive up prices, and make it even more difficult to buy a new home.</p>\n<p>Experts seem to think the {{< external-link url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/real-estate/housing-market-predictions/\" text=\"seller's market will continue\" >}} through the early part of 2023. But this doesn't mean buyers are totally out of luck. With the right strategies in place and a willingness to compromise on some points, you can improve the chances of your offer being accepted. Here are seven tips for buying a home in a seller’s market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoidofferswithconstraints\">Avoid offers with constraints</h2>\n<p>Sellers are more inclined to take offers that are ready to go with no constraints on them. For example, most people want to sell their current home before they complete escrow on the new property. The seller, however, may not want to wait, and in a seller’s market, they probably don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Essentially, any concession you ask of the seller, whether it’s help with closing costs or time to find alternative financing, can make your offer less appealing. And in a seller’s market, the seller has little to no incentive to deal with complications. To compete, you need to make a clean offer quickly and close without needing to wait on other parties or transactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeanofferaboveasking\">Make an offer above asking</h2>\n<p>If you like a home, then chances are other buyers are interested in it too - especially in a seller’s market - and that pushes prices up. This means homebuyers may need to “make an offer that is higher than expected,” according to Stan Mead of {{< external-link url=\"http://www.sellmyhomeinsaltlakecity.com/\" text=\"Summit Home Buyers\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Depending on your location, you may not need to go very high over the asking price. You may show that you're a serious contender by offering just $2,000 above. That amount won’t have a major impact on your <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>, but remember that you aren’t the only one competing for the property. Those that have the funds may offer $10,000 or more above asking price, and that may put the house too far out of your budget.</p>\n<p>You can combat that, however, by looking for homes on the low end of your budget. That way, you have room to bid up without dipping into your savings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dontaskforpersonalproperty\">Don’t ask for personal property</h2>\n<p>A seller’s market is no time for haggling. Trying to cut a deal for patio furniture, custom bookcases, and chandeliers gives the seller extra time to think, and that’s usually not a good thing when the seller has lots of potential buyers. Sellers want the sale to go quickly without hassle, and quibbling over personal property complicates the transaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makealargedeposit\">Make a large deposit</h2>\n<p>Your deposit, called an earnest money deposit (EMD), is the first sign to the seller of how serious of a buyer you are. While you may only be required to put down one to three percent of the purchase price, the more you put down, the more serious you look. Sellers see a large deposit and assume you have the resources to fund the purchase, and this usually causes them to take your offer more seriously – sometimes even if it’s lower than other offers with a smaller EMD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"waivetheappraisalcontingency\">Waive the appraisal contingency</h2>\n<p>Waiving the <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> is a powerful tool in seller’s markets, but you may only be able to use it if you have a mortgage funding the purchase. Prices in fast-moving seller’s markets are inflated because of the lack of inventory. This means that properties going for more than the asking price might be appraised for less, so your loan may fall short. By waiving the appraisal contingency, you tell the seller that you have full faith that you’re buying a property worth the purchase price regardless of what experts might say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"payincash\">Pay in cash</h2>\n<p>One of the most stressful parts of escrow is waiting for the loan’s final approval and funding. If your loan is denied, then you don’t get the house and the seller has wasted time on a transaction that didn’t go through.</p>\n<p>But according to Eric Nerhood of Premier Property Buyers, “By using an all-cash purchase, there is no waiting for the money.” Offering all cash puts you in the driver’s seat where you don’t have to rely on lenders to make final approvals. Seller’s love this and often take a lower purchase price when the transaction is all cash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"offer1monthoffreeoccupancy\">Offer 1 month of free occupancy</h2>\n<p>Chances are most sellers are also looking to buy a home, which means they’re struggling with the same market conditions you are. So while they’re getting plenty of offers for their home, they might not have a new home to move into. Offering a month of occupancy gives the seller breathing room to finish their purchase and vacate, plus your first mortgage payment isn’t due for a month after you close. Jason Gelios from Community Choice Realty calls this an “out of the box amenity” that gives you an edge when competing against similar offers.</p>\n<p>Figuring out how to buy a house in a seller's market can seem impossible, but you can make it happen. Use these and other <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">tips to get you through the home-buying process</a>.</p>"

      title: "How to buy a house with no money down"
      body: "<p>Many of us dream about homeownership, but buying a house can seem out of reach. After all, a down payment can be tens of thousands of dollars, and that’s a barrier for many first-time homebuyers.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be. Plenty of people become homeowners with zero-down mortgages. While this is an entryway for many, it comes with its own set of considerations. Let's look at how to buy a house with no money down and how to know if it’s a good option for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisazerodownmortgage\">What is a zero-down mortgage?</h2>\n<p>A zero-down mortgage is simply a home loan that doesn’t require a down payment. Most <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgages</a> require you to make a down payment at closing. When you get a no-down payment mortgage, you essentially finance the entire house and only pay traditional closing costs, such as attorney fees and taxes. This makes <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">owning a house more affordable</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nomoneydownmortgageprograms\">No-money-down mortgage programs</h2>\n<p>There are two programs for first-time homebuyers where you can actually buy a home without making a down payment. Both programs are backed by federal funds to reduce the risk to lenders and encourage new purchases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) home loans:</strong> {{< external-link url=\"https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/\" text=\"VA loans\" >}} are reserved for active-duty service members, members of the National guard, and veterans or their spouses, and eligibility depends on the applicant’s time in the military. The VA does not set a minimum credit score, but the lenders who make the loans may.</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Agriculture (USDA) home loans:</strong> {{< external-link url=\"https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do\" text=\"USDA loans\" >}} are designed to encourage property ownership in designated rural and suburban areas. In addition to having a home in one of these locations, you also have to meet certain financial requirements including a credit score of at least 640 and a combined household income that is less than 115 percent of the median income of the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"alternativestonomoneydownprograms\">Alternatives to no-money-down programs</h3>\n<p>The programs for a no-money-down mortgage are pretty limited, but they aren’t your only option if you’re struggling to put the funds together for a down payment. If you have some cash available, you might try a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loan:</strong> Depending on your credit score, you may be able to get an <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">FHA loan</a> for as little as 3.5 percent down.</li>\n<li><strong>Conventional home loan:</strong> You may be able to get a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan that only requires a 3 percent down payment. However, these loans typically have higher credit score requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Piggyback loan:</strong> Also called an 80/10/10 loan, a piggyback loan lets you get two mortgages at the same time. The first is for 80 percent of the purchase price, and then you piggyback a second loan on top of that for another 10 percent, leaving only 10 percent required for a down payment. This loan usually requires a higher credit score.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage assumption:</strong> Eric Nerhood of Premier Property Buyers explains that this is when “the buyer takes over the payments on the mortgage that the seller already has on the property.” This can get the seller out of a bad situation, while the buyer usually pays them just a nominal fee.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"privatemortgageinsuranceandnointerestloans\">Private mortgage insurance and no-interest loans</h2>\n<p>There is a tradeoff when you buy a home using a low-interest loan: you’ll have to pay <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI). This insurance protects the lender in case you default on your loan and your property goes into foreclosure. It’s a mechanism that allows lenders to loan money for most, or sometimes all, of the property’s price.</p>\n<p>But PMI can be pricey. It typically costs  anywhere from 0.5 to 1 percent of your loan amount, and that’s tacked onto your mortgage payment. Moreover, you keep paying it until you reach a minimum of 20 percent equity in the home. Then you can request to have the PMI removed.</p>\n<p>To be fair, neither USDA nor VA loans require PMI. However, both can have other fees to consider. The VA charges home buyers a funding fee between 1.4 percent and 3.6 percent of the loan. As for the USDA, it charges both an upfront guarantee fee and an annual fee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isazerodownorlowinterestloanrightforyou\">Is a zero-down or low-interest loan right for you?</h2>\n<p>If you want to buy a home and don’t have money for a down payment, a no-down loan may be a good – depending on your situation. According to Jason Gelios, top-producing realtor with Community Choice Realty, home buyers need to consider their goals and what the market is doing before choosing a mortgage.</p>\n<p>“If someone purchases a home and some unforeseen circumstance happens where they have to sell, they may not be able to sell the property for more than what they purchased it for,” says Gelios. “This could spell trouble.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, your particular situation determines what sort of mortgage is right for you. That said, we can offer a few things to think about to help you decide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"canyouaffordtheinterest\">Can you afford the interest?</h3>\n<p>A no-money-down loan may save you money on the front end, but you have to consider what that means over time. Everyone who takes out a loan pays more than the amount they borrow because they have to pay interest. Putting some money down reduces your interest and may actually be less expensive in the long run.</p>\n<p>Just because the loan doesn’t require a down payment doesn’t mean that you can’t put some money down. But if you choose this route, you need to be thoughtful about how much to pay. A small percentage down may not have much impact on a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatareyourlongtermplans\">What are your long-term plans?</h3>\n<p>For the most part, home values go up, and that generally means you’re more likely to see a good return on your investment the longer you stay in your home. But this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, as anyone who bought a home before the Great Recession can tell you.</p>\n<p>Plus, think about how stable your income is. If unforeseen circumstances cause you to have to get out of your loan, you may have to pay a hefty price.</p>\n<h3 id=\"areyoubuyingahomethatneedsrepairs\">Are you buying a home that needs repairs?</h3>\n<p>Normal maintenance alone can add up to a significant chunk of change every year, but if you’re looking at a home that needs major repairs, you may want to consider a no-down-payment loan. It can help you preserve your savings so you have a safety net of funds to handle home repairs.</p>\n<p>House flipper Alex Capozzolo says that if “you need to pay more than $10,000 on fixing up a house before you can move in, it makes sense to buy it with no money down.” He adds this may be especially true if the house is older and you anticipate more repairs in the future.</p>\n<p>The main idea here is to protect your nest egg, and it may apply in a number of scenarios. Just because you have a savings account doesn’t mean you should spend every dime of it on a down payment. You’ll likely need some of it for other expenses.</p>\n<p>Before you go for a loan that requires no money down, consider all aspects of your financial situation. A zero-down mortgage can certainly open up buying opportunities for those who qualify and don’t have the means to put a large down payment on the property. But while it makes the entry point easier, it also means higher mortgage payments, more interest paid over the course of the loan, and private mortgage insurance premiums.</p>"

      title: "How to buy a mobile home in Florida"
      body: "<p>With its warm temperate climate, beautiful beaches, and lack of state income taxes, Florida is a great place to live. And a growing number of people moving to the Sunshine State are choosing to live in mobile home communities or buy manufactured homes for their land.</p>\n<p>Figuring out how to buy a mobile home in Florida can be just as complex as buying a site-built one – maybe even more so. Let’s explore some of the biggest issues that come with buying a manufactured home, including Florida mobile home financing and taxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5tipsforbuyingamobilehomeinflorida\">5 tips for buying a mobile home in Florida</h2>\n<p>In many ways, buying a manufactured home in Florida is a lot like the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a traditional home</a>. You want to determine if you’re ready, start saving for a down payment, and look into mobile home financing in Florida. Those steps, however, may look a little different when you’re purchasing a mobile home, so we put together five tips to help you dig into the specifics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1determinewhatyourebuying\">1. Determine what you’re buying</h3>\n<p>Yes, you’re buying a manufactured home, but you want to decide if you want to buy just the dwelling and rent a lot in a mobile home park or buy the land, too. Buying the land your home sits on may mean you see some return on your investment if the land appreciates. But lots in mobile home parks usually have utility hook-ups, so they can be more convenient.</p>\n<p>The additional services and the bonus of living in a secure location can make the fee for renting worth it. However, ownership can mean lower costs in the long run and the ability to recuperate a significant part of your investment by selling the land for a higher price than when you bought it.</p>\n<p>Making the choice between a mobile park community or buying your own land also gives you a better idea of your monthly costs. This is a key consideration when purchasing any home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2investigateseveralcommunities\">2. Investigate several communities</h3>\n<p>Some of the more common Florida mobile home communities are land-lease parks (i.e., you don’t own the land), land-owned subdivisions, and resident-owned communities. Within each of these, you may also find age-restricted or retirement communities. That’s a lot of options, so go to several and talk to the residents to get a sense of which fits you best.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that some municipalities in Florida restrict where you can place your mobile home. This usually means you end up in more rural areas outside of city limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3performyourduediligence\">3. Perform your due diligence</h3>\n<p>Before you buy a mobile home in Florida, check public records for any red flags. This might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going to the clerk of court and checking eviction records, title disputes, and other legal issues.</li>\n<li>Calling the local code enforcement office and asking about serious violations.</li>\n<li>Searching the internet to see if the mobile home park is up for sale or has recently changed hands.</li>\n<li>Checking the mobile home’s vehicle identification number through the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4readuponfloridasmobilehomelaws\">4. Read up on Florida’s mobile home laws</h3>\n<p>When you want to buy a mobile home in Florida, you may also want to familiarize yourself with the Florida statutes that {{< external-link url=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App<em>mode=Display</em>Statute&URL=0700-0799/0723/0723.html\" text=\"govern mobile home park tenancies\" >}}, particularly the section on obligations for residents and park owners. For example, mobile home park owners have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with all applicable building, housing, and health codes.</li>\n<li>Provide access to all common areas at reasonable times.</li>\n<li>Keep the utilities the park is responsible for in good working condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mobile home owners have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep their mobile homes clean, neat, and sanitary.</li>\n<li>Comply with the mobile home park’s rules.</li>\n<li>Get written approval before making modifications to their mobile home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another important aspect of Florida laws governing manufactured homes is the information regarding <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0320/0320.html\">mobile home installation and permits</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5buymobilehomeinsurance\">5. Buy mobile home insurance</h3>\n<p>One of the attractions of mobile homes is their affordability. But even if they’re less than traditional homes, manufactured homes are major investments that need to be protected. That's where <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> comes in. Policies can help you overcome a financial setback if your mobile home is damaged by <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered perils</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, our mobile home insurance offers open-peril coverage for your dwelling, which means damage is usually covered unless it was caused by one of the events specifically excluded in the policy.

A mobile home is only considered real property if the owner also owns the land it sits on and the home is permanently attached to that land, {{< external-link url=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App<em>mode=Display</em>Statute&Search<em>String=&URL=0300-0399/0320/Se</em>tions/0320.015.html\" text=\"_according to Florida law\" >}}. If your manufactured home doesn’t fit this description, then it’s more likely considered chattel, or moveable personal property.</p>\n<p>You can finance a manufactured home that is chattel through a personal property loan, much like you finance a car. Typically, this requires about five percent down with your home as collateral that your lender can repossess if you fail to pay.</p>\n<p>Another option is the Federal Housing Authority’s Title I program. These are usually 20-year fixed-rate loans that you can use to purchase a manufactured home, a lot, or both. The down payment is usually between 3.5 and 10 percent.</p>\n<p>If your mobile home is considered real property, you may be able to get the following <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">types of mortgages</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conventional loan.</strong> These privately funded and insured mobile home loans in Florida offer competitive interest rates, but often require a good credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, and about 20 percent down.</li>\n<li><strong>A US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan.</strong> You can apply to the USDA Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, but you’ll have to meet certain income and geographic criteria to qualify.</li>\n<li><strong>A US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan.</strong> The VA also has a guaranteed loan program that can be used for manufactured housing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howaremobilehomestaxedinflorida\">How are mobile homes taxed in Florida?</h2>\n<p>{{< external-link url=\"https://floridarevenue.com/Forms_library/current/gt800047.pdf\" text=\"According to the Florida Department of Revenue\" >}}, mobile homes are taxed in one of three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assessed and taxed as real property.</strong> Your manufactured home is taxed annually as real property if it's affixed to land that you own.</li>\n<li><strong>Subjected to an annual license tax.</strong> If you don’t own the land your mobile home sits on, then you must buy a mobile home decal from the DHSMV every year.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessed and taxed as tangible personal property.</strong> This tax applies if your manufactured home qualifies for the mobile home decal, but does not have a current one on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is taxed as real property, you may be eligible for <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida homestead exemption</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandmobilehomecommunityrules\">Understand mobile home community rules</h2>\n<p>If you’re aiming to live in a mobile home park, you want to read through its regulations, including bylaws if there’s a mobile homeowners’ association.

      title: "How to calculate the square footage of a house"
      body: "<p>Most of us probably care about the square footage of a house when we’re looking to buy because it tells us how much house (i.e., livable space) we’re actually getting. But square footage also impacts your tax assessments, home insurance, and even getting permits for renovations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4stepsformeasuringthesquarefootageofahouse\">4 steps for measuring the square footage of a house</h2>\n<p>If you’re measuring square footage to find out how much livable space your house has, you’ll want to take interior measurements. By measuring from the inside wall, you can get a better sense of whether or not the space meets your needs. For example, you might have a sofa that needs a certain length of wall space. If the room doesn’t have it, the sofa won’t fit.</p>\n<p>The steps for calculating the square footage of a house are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sketch each room of your house.</strong> Plotting out every room of your house, including hallways and closets, can help you tally your square footage as you go</li>\n<li><strong>Measure the length and width of each room.</strong> Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of every room in feet. This is easy when the room is rectangular or square. However, if you have oddly shaped rooms, you may want to use an {{< external-link url=\"https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/construction/square-footage-calculator.php\" text=\"online square footage calculator\" >}}.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiply the length and width.</strong> For example, if your living room is 20 feet by 15 feet, its square footage is 300 square feet. Note each room’s measurement on the sketch you created in the first step.</li>\n<li><strong>Add room values together.</strong> Take the totals from each room and add them together to get the total square footage of the house. This is the usable space in your home and may be different from an appraisal or the country tax records.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a room with nooks and crannies you may need to break it down into measurable rectangles. That way, you can get the square footage of the smaller spaces and add them all together for the room’s total square footage.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say that your living room is 10-foot wide, but one wall has an odd notch at the corner that protrudes one foot into the room, like the image shown below.  <img src=\"/images/uploads/square_footage.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The best way to measure the square footage for that room is to divide it into two rectangles. The first rectangle starts at the edge of the notch and goes to the other wall, and the second is the rest of the room.</p>\n<p>Some people make the mistake of calculating the square footage of a two-story home by measuring the bottom floor and simply multiplying that number by two. This can be accurate if the floor plans for each floor match exactly, but it’s incorrect for homes with two-floor entryways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howisthesquarefootageofahousecalculatedforanappraisal\">How is the square footage of a house calculated for an appraisal?</h3>\n<p>Most people who buy a house get an <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> to determine its fair market value, and one of the appraiser’s tasks is calculating the home’s square footage. The process is often similar to what you would do to measure square footage. However, your appraiser’s calculation might not match yours or even what’s on the actual listing.</p>\n<p>The most common reason the square footage may be different in your appraisal is because an appraiser needs to evaluate the total value of your home. As a result, the square footage in an appraisal may include nonliving spaces, like attics, unheated basements, and open patios.</p>\n<p>Your appraiser’s square footage calculation may more closely match what’s on county tax records, but that’s not always the case. For example, the square footage of a house may not be accurate on tax records if the owner enclosed their patio without getting permits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ishousesquarefootagemeasuredinsideorout\">Is house square footage measured inside or out?</h3>\n<p>Whether a home’s square footage is measured by the interior or exterior depends on who you ask. An interior designer and realtors who need to determine the usable space may use the interior walls. Architects, however, may use exterior walls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisincludedinthesquarefootageofahouse\">What is included in the square footage of a house?</h2>\n<p>Only usable space is included in your home’s square footage. Typically, usable space is defined as areas in your home that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share the same heating and cooling system as the main house.</li>\n<li>Are located above ground.</li>\n<li>Conform to your home’s architectural standard.</li>\n<li>Are finished and adjoining.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at it that way, it’s pretty clear that rooms like your kitchen, living room, bathrooms, and bedrooms are part of your square footage﹘as long as you don’t have to pass through unfinished spaces to reach them. The same goes for hallways, stairways, and closets. Enclosed patios may be included if they have four walls and a roof and use the same heating as the rest of your home.</p>\n<p>A finished attic can also be part of your square footage, but like enclosed patios, it usually has to share your home’s heating and cooling system. Plus, it may need a certain amount of headroom to count.</p>\n<p>Garage and basements aren’t usually included in the square footage of a house. This is often true even if the basement is finished because it’s below ground level. However, some states do allow you to include finished basements when they have safe ways to enter and exit. Detached structures such as sheds are also generally excluded from the calculations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doclosetscountassquarefootage\">Do closets count as square footage?</h3>\n<p>Closet areas are included in the square footage of a home, but only when they are in the main home. Closets in areas that aren’t considered usable space, like basements, aren’t included. When you calculate the square footage of a house, treat each individual closet as if it were a room and add it to your total.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howimportantisthesquarefootageofahouse\">How important is the square footage of a house?</h2>\n<p>Square footage can be very important when it comes to buying or selling a home. Many buyers start looking with a particular number in mind, so having an accurate measurement can help get your home in front of the right audience.</p>\n<p>However, Chief Real Estate Analyst and Managing Editor of {{< external-link url=\"https://theclose.com\" text=\"The Close\" >}}, Emile L’Eplattenier says that in some cases, other features can be more important than square footage. A good example in some markets is when developers decrease size in favor of amenities.</p>\n<p>“While price per square foot is still a useful metric,” says L’Eplattenier, “developers of luxury buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been decreasing average unit sizes for more than a decade now.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, homebuyers need to use the square footage of a house they’re interested in as one piece of information. It may tell them something about whether the house fits their needs, but they need to weigh other factors, like location and quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"squarefootageandhomeinsurance\">Square footage and home insurance</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies usually want to know your home’s square footage when you apply for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> because they use it to figure out how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> you need. They need to know that you’re insured for what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up. Having accurate square footage helps both you and your insurer know that you are insuring your home properly.</p>"

      title: "How to Choose a Light Bulb"
      body: "<p>Despite the longstanding jokes, changing a lightbulb is pretty easy and should require just one person. But figuring out how to choose a light bulb? That’s a surprisingly different story. From old-fashioned incandescent bulbs to new LED and smart bulbs, it feels like you need a team of experts to pick the best bulb for your situation.</p>\n<p>We took a dive into your options to help you better understand what's available and when to use different types of light bulbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoestherightlightbulbmatter\">Why Does the Right Light Bulb Matter?</h2>\n<p>The primary concern when choosing a light bulb is illumination. You want to have enough light to make a space functional. But you also want to think about creating the right ambiance for the room. Some bulbs produce brighter, whiter light that makes more sense in a kitchen or bathroom. Other light bulbs give off a warm, yellowish light, which may make them right for a bedroom.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you also want to think about the cost and the amount of energy a light bulb consumes. High-efficiency light bulbs are usually more expensive, but use less energy so you buy fewer of them over time. Considering the <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">environmental concerns</a> facing our world, using energy efficient light bulbs may be the smart choice both for your budget and the greater good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesoflightbulbs\">Types of Light Bulbs</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the type of light bulbs you can find in your home improvement store.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incandescentlightbulbs\">Incandescent Light Bulbs</h3>\n<p>The incandescent light bulb is the original light bulb. It works by heating a filament that glows when hot. While many feel that incandescent bulbs are archaic, they’re still popular because they’re inexpensive and easy to use. People generally like that incandescent light bulbs dim easily with a simple device called a rheostat and the warm ambiance they produce compared to new technology bulbs.</p>\n<p>Incandescent bulbs saw a resurgence in popularity when Edison bulbs became a trendy lighting option. However, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set maximum power consumption that reduced the number of incandescent bulbs made. Incandescent light bulbs are still available, but many homeowners have shifted towards more energy-efficient bulbs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"halogenlightbulbs\">Halogen Light Bulbs</h3>\n<p>A halogen light bulb is similar to an incandescent bulb where current flows along a filament, heating it up until it glows. But halogens actually have an internal bulb that’s a quartz capsule filled with halogen gas. The internal system used by halogen bulbs means that they are able to reuse the elements internally and last longer﹘up to 4,000 hours compared to just 750 to 2,000 hours for incandescent bulb.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compactfluorescentlampcflbulbs\">Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) Bulbs</h3>\n<p>CFL bulbs were the first wave in light bulb technology that produced a high light output while helping conserve energy. As the name suggests, this is a fluorescent bulb that lasts longer than traditional incandescent bulbs. In fact, they are thought to last ten times longer than incandescent bulbs, making the case for their more expensive purchase price.</p>\n<p>Homeowners like CFL bulbs for the savings over time but also because they can use CFLs in hard-to-reach sockets where changing more frequently can prove challenging. However, the early versions produced harsh light that turned many people off. Plus, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.epa.gov/cfl/what-are-connections-between-mercury-and-cfls\" text=\"CFL bulbs contain a tiny amount of mercury\" >}} that can be released if the bulb is broken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightemittingdiodeledbulbs\">Light Emitting Diode (LED) Bulbs</h3>\n<p>LED bulbs are taking over the aisles in many home improvement stores. These bulbs are nearly 90 percent more efficient than incandescent bulbs and they last up to 50,000 hours. On top of their ability to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce your energy bill</a>, LEDs don’t contain mercury and they come in a variety of shapes and styles.</p>\n<p>You can also get internet-capable LED bulbs, called smart bulbs, that can turn on and off, dim or brighten, and even change color depending on how you program them. These benefits make LED lights a popular choice with homeowners, despite the steep upfront costs. The price, however, is balanced out by the energy savings over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wattagevslumensexplained\">Wattage vs. Lumens Explained</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, light bulbs were sold based on wattage. You’d go out to buy a 60- or 80-watt bulb, knowing that the higher wattage meant a brighter bulb. But wattage describes electricity consumption so as more energy-efficient bulbs came to market, wattage became a less useful description for light bulbs. After all, new light bulbs use less energy to provide the same, if not more, light.</p>\n<p>This is where measuring lumens is important. Lumens are the amount of light generated by a light bulb. Incandescent bulbs produce approximately 15 lumens per watt, and LEDs produce about 60 lumens per watt, so it uses less energy to provide more light. Understanding this helps you decide how many light bulbs to buy. But remember﹘fixtures have safety ratings that limit the number of watts they can take. Never use a bulb that exceeds a fixture’s safety rating.</p>\n<p>The table below is a light bulb wattage guide. Across the top, it lists four common light bulbs (incandescent, halogen, CFL, and LED) with the wattage you’d need to get the lumens listed in the far left column.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightbulbwattageguide\">Light Bulb Wattage Guide</h3>\n<p>| Lumens | Incandescent | Halogen | CFL | LED |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 220 | 25w | 18w | 5w | 4.5w |\n| 410 | 40w | 28w | 8w | 9w |\n| 700 | 60w | 42w | 12w | 13w |\n| 920 | 75w | 53w | 15w | 13w |\n| 1330 | 100w | 70w | 20w | 18w |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p><em>Source: Display Smart, LLC.</em> {{< external-link url=\"https://www.display-smart.com/understanding-display-case-led-lighting-terminology/\" text=\"<em>Understanding Display Case LED Lighting Terminology</em>\" >}} Sept. 24, 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherthingstoconsiderwhenpickingalightbulb\">Other Things to Consider When Picking a Light Bulb</h2>\n<p>Knowing the different types of bulbs is just step one to picking the right one for you. The next is to think about where you need light, how much light that area needs, and what kind of fixtures you have available to you. Your answers to these questions can help you choose a light bulb with the right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color and brightness.</strong> Even white light can produce different colors. These generally fall between a soft, yellow to a neutral white to a bright, slightly bluish light. Certain rooms, like kitchens, garages, and bathrooms, often need bright, whiter light.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixtures.</strong> Light bulbs can react differently to heat. LEDs, for example, are sensitive to heat and might not work well or last as long in recessed or enclosed fixtures. Fixtures also have safety ratings, so you need to buy light bulbs that do not exceed the watt limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Fitting.</strong> The most common fitting is the Edison screw where a bulb with a threaded base screws into a matching socket. However, halogen and LED bulbs may have GU10 fittings, which are installed with a light push and slight turn. You should also note that not every light bulb is compatible with a dimmer, so be sure to check before you buy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LED light bulbs seem like a clear winner in many situations because they’re cost effective and versatile. That said, you may find them less useful if you have particular fixtures or require certain fittings.</p>"

      title: "How to go green this winter | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>Have you checked your energy bill? Chances you saw a bit of a spike last month. Even if you went without holiday lights, you probably used a lot of energy just trying to keep your house warm.</p>\n<p>If your utility bills are causing sticker shock, then now may be the time to make your home more eco-friendly. Doing this not only helps lower your energy costs, but it can combat climate change. We’ve come up with three options for making a more energy-efficient home to help homeowners go green this winter. Take a look!</p>\n<h2 id=\"installsolarpanels\">Install solar panels</h2>\n<p>The typical American household uses {{< external-link url=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3\" text=\"10,632 kilowatt-hours\" >}} (kWh) of electricity per year, or approximately 886 kWh each month. But during the winter, that can jump to {{< external-link url=\"https://www.katoelectrical.com/blog-1/power-use-in-the-winter\" text=\"3,100 kWh\" >}} per month. An increase in usage like that often translates into skyrocketing energy bills.</p>\n<p>Solar panels are an effective way to combat this cost. When they’re properly installed, residential solar panels reduce the amount of energy being produced in your home and can save you up to {{< external-link url=\"https://seedscientific.com/why-is-my-electric-bill-so-high-with-solar-panels/\" text=\"90% on monthly electricity bills\" >}}. That’s true even in the winter because solar panels rely strictly on sunlight to produce electricity. As long as there’s light, they’ll work no matter how cold it is outside.</p>\n<p>Before you switch to solar, however, you’ll want to do some research. There are four different {{< external-link url=\"https://www.rocketsolar.com/learn/solar-basics/solar-panels-for-home\" text=\"home solar panel systems\" >}} you can choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grid-tied systems that are permanently connected to your local utility’s power grid so you can supplement your solar energy.</li>\n<li>Off-grid systems that aren’t connected to a power grid.</li>\n<li>Grid-tied systems with back-up solar batteries.</li>\n<li>Solar leases that you rent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each has its own benefits, but ultimately it’s up to you to decide the best fit for your home. You’ll also want to think about your <a href=\"/blog/how-long-do-roofs-last/\">roof material</a> and shape. Some roofs are better for solar panels than others. You’ll also want to pay attention to the price. Installing solar panels can be expensive, costing anywhere between $15,000 to $31,000 depending on the model you choose.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration? Your insurance. Homeowners policies <a href=\"/faq/solar-panel-insurance/\">typically cover solar panels</a> you own that are permanently attached to your roof. Solar leases may require separate coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"useasmartthermostat\">Use a smart thermostat</h2>\n<p>Cold temperatures affect most of the country throughout the winter, making heating systems necessary to heat an entire house. But traditional heating systems can eat up a lot of energy. The average electric furnace uses {{< external-link url=\"https://news.energysage.com/how-many-watts-does-an-electric-furnace-use/\" text=\"182 kWh\" >}} every week. Worse? You may even be wasting energy if your furnace runs when you don’t need it.</p>\n<p>One solution is to install a smart thermostat. By automatically lowering the temperature in your home when you don’t need it – or even letting you monitor it remotely! – these thermostats help use your home's energy more sustainably and reduce your energy bill.</p>\n<p>These days, there are a ton of options to choose from, but ultimately, you have three main {{< external-link url=\"https://thecoolingco.com/what-are-the-types-of-smart-thermostats/\" text=\"types of smart thermostats\" >}}:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motion sensor.</strong> Similar to motion detection lights, smart thermostats with motion sensors activate when they recognize when someone is in your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Geofencing.</strong> This type of smart thermostat creates a “fence” around your home. When you go beyond the fence, the thermostat adjusts the temperature in your house to help save energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning algorithms.</strong> Typically, you need to program your schedule into this type of smart thermostat so over time it can learn your living pattern and adjust the temperature automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installation may cost a few hundred dollars, but the savings usually make the upfront costs worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosereusablematerials\">Choose reusable materials</h2>\n<p>People may not realize how much waste they create during the holidays. On average, Americans throw away {{< external-link url=\"https://lbre.stanford.edu/pssistanford-recycling/frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-holiday-waste-prevention\" text=\"25% more trash\" >}} from Thanksgiving to New Year, including plastic cups, plastic silverware, paper plates, and more.</p>\n<p>You can reduce the amount of waste you generate by using more reusable materials. For example, you could opt for mugs when you drink hot chocolate or coffee and real silverware and plates for when you have family over for the holidays.</p>\n<p>Switching to reusable materials means you’ll not just cut down on unnecessary waste and ultimately lower your carbon footprint, but you’ll save you money in the long run. Constantly replacing single-use items is expensive – even if you buy cheap things you don’t mind tossing.</p>\n<p>Using real silverware and plates is an easy fix to use instead of buying one-use materials. It saves you money in the long run from constantly replacing plastic and paper materials while simultaneously protecting the environment from added waste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomlineongoinggreenthiswinter\">The bottom line on going green this winter</h2>\n<p>Environmental concerns may not be the first thing that comes to mind in the middle of winter, but taking care of the earth is something we can do all year round. While these tips may not be for all households, we encourage everyone to look for ways to go green this season.</p>"

      title: "How to Hire a Home Improvement Contractor"
      body: "<p>Whether you want to make some small aesthetic updates to your home or have a big remodeling project planned, hiring a good contractor is a must. But how do you know what to look for? What makes a contractor trustworthy? This guide will help you zero in on the traits of a quality contractor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretosearchforahomeimprovementcontractor\">Where to Search for a Home Improvement Contractor</h2>\n<p>Ask your neighbors, friends, and family for their recommendations. If they’ve hired someone to do a home improvement project in the past, they can tell you from firsthand experience if they were satisfied with the work and what you can expect. They can also tip you off on who <em>not</em> to hire, in some cases.</p>\n<p>If your network doesn’t have recommendations for you, explore potential candidates online. Platforms like Thumbtack and <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/\">Angie’s List</a> can give you insight into the contractor’s experience, licensing information, past projects, and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Give yourself some options so you can compare offers on your project and leverage lower bids. A pool of three contractors is usually a good starting point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contractorcredentialchecklist\">Contractor Credential Checklist</h2>\n<p>Once you have a list of contractors, prepare some interview questions so you can learn more about who the contractor is and why you should trust them with your home. For example, you might ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have a license?</strong> A license insures the contractor knows the appropriate codes and processes to safely and effectively work on your home. Write down your contractor’s license number and look it up on your state’s license board.</li>\n<li><strong>Are you bonded and insured?</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.bbb.org/\">Better Business Bureau</a> lists whether your contractor is insured and bonded. You can also ask to see their certificate of liability insurance (this document is readily available to insureds). This protects you if the contractor doesn’t finish the project because you can make a claim on their coverage to reimburse you for losses.</li>\n<li><strong>What kind of work do you specialize in?</strong> Contractor may specialize in an array of trades, from electrical work or carpentry to roofing or landscaping. Make sure your potential contractor has the expertise your project requires.</li>\n<li><strong>Can you provide a list of previous clients?</strong> A reputable contractor is usually happy to share their references.</li>\n<li><strong>Where are you based?</strong> Look for a local contractor – their ties to the community may mean they will care about maintaining a good reputation. Ask for their business address for proof of their location.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"projectspecificquestionstoaskyourcontractor\">Project-Specific Questions to Ask Your Contractor</h2>\n<p>In addition to asking questions about their professional background, licensing, insurance, and expertise, you should ask logistical questions about the project. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you take on projects of this size?</strong> Some contractors only have one or two workers so may not be equipped to take on a big project. By contrast, some contractors may only be interested in doing big remodels rather than small repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you have photos of similar finished work?</strong> Most skilled contractors are proud to show proof of past projects, whether that's a full kitchen remodel, underground <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool</a> installation, or a new patio deck.</li>\n<li><strong>How many other projects would you work on at the same time?</strong> This will give you insight into whether they will be responsive to your needs and adhere to the project timeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Are your subcontractors insured?</strong> Everyone working on the project should have insurance to safeguard you against financial loss in case they deliver incomplete or subpar work.</li>\n<li><strong>Can you obtain permits?</strong> Contractors may wish to avoid getting permits for smaller projects, but a permit ensures they are able to comply with local building codes. It’s important for their safety and your security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatahomeimprovementcontractshouldinclude\">What a Home Improvement Contract Should Include</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve settled on a contractor, it’s time to review the contract. A professional project contract will usually address the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The contractor’s name, address, phone, and license number.</li>\n<li>A estimated start and completion date to ensure project is completed on time.</li>\n<li>The payment schedule to ensure transparency.</li>\n<li>Obligation to get permits to ensure legal compliance.</li>\n<li>What happens if you decide to make a change in the scope of the project.</li>\n<li>Materials and allowances to avoid surprise extra expenses.</li>\n<li>Warranties that protect your interests.</li>\n<li>Cleanup clauses so you know what to expect after the project is finished.</li>\n<li>Your ability to sever the relationship if the contractor violates the rules of the contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are worried about being able to pay on time, make sure a payment plan is included in your contract. Otherwise, the contractor may be able to take out a lien, or real estate debt, against you for themselves and their subcontractors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contractorredflags\">Contractor Red Flags</h2>\n<p>Home improvement scammers are prevalent, which is why it’s so important to check references. No homeowner wants work done by an amateur or a fly-by-night operation. Follow the suggestions above and watch out for these red flags to avoid a potential scam:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have lousy reviews or outdated references.</li>\n<li>They are slow to respond.</li>\n<li>They ask for too much money upfront.</li>\n<li>They ask you to get the required building permits.</li>\n<li>They don’t show proof of their bond and insurance.</li>\n<li>Their bond and/or insurance is expired.</li>\n<li>They seem impatient, cut you off, or don’t listen to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hiring the right contractor will have a significant impact on whether your home improvement project is a smooth or frustrating experience. When in doubt, do your research and due diligence, but also trust your instincts. At the end of the day, you have to trust the person you hire, and there’s no one answer for that.</p>\n<p>And remember, when you update your home, you may need to make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> still adequately protects your property. Plus, if your upgrades make your home safer (say, a new roof with <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane</a> clips or wind mitigation system), you may even qualify for <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">premium discounts</a>.

      title: "How to keep pipes from freezing"
      body: "<p>Freezing pipes are one of the most common home insurance claims in the winter. In fact, along with internal water damage, they are the <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">third most common claim</a> and cost about $10,849 to repair on average.</p>\n<p>As the water in the pipes freeze, it expands and creates pressure, which can rupture the pipe. As the ice in the pipes melts, it can cause water damage throughout the home.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what has happened to countless Texan homes mid-February when a winter storm and hard freeze swept unexpectedly through the state and caused massive power outages. The <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/burst-pipes-plumbers-texas/\">Insurance Council of Texas</a> stated, “We expect the claims for frozen, busted pipes to be unlike any event the state has experienced.”</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can cover repairing a burst pipe and subsequent water damage, it’s helpful to know how to prevent it in the first place if you’re able. So let’s take a look at how to keep pipes from freezing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1insulatethepipes\">1. Insulate the pipes</h2>\n<p>There are many reasons for the tragic situation in Texas. Among them, many Texas homes aren’t winterized because winters in the South are usually mild. When temperatures do drop, heating in the homes is typically enough to keep freezing at bay. Because the power failed, many homeowners couldn’t prepare in time.</p>\n<p>But how do you insulate pipes if you have the chance? Start with exposed pipes under cabinets, in basements, and in the garage. Many hardware stores sell easy-to-install insulation like pipe sleeves. This helps keep the temperature of the pipe more regulated, though it won’t prevent every disaster. If you’re in a pinch and need to insulate a pipe quickly, roll a quarter inch of newspaper around the pipe.</p>\n<p>You can also insulate the rooms where pipes are – areas like attics and basements. This will help keep the overall temperature in the room warmer and reduce the likelihood of your pipes freezing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2sealupcracksandholesnearpipes\">2. Seal up cracks and holes near pipes</h2>\n<p>Cracks and holes let cold drafts in. During freezing temperatures, the last thing you want is cold air on your pipes. Solve this problem by sealing up any cracks, holes, and gaps under cabinets near your pipes.</p>\n<p>When possible, seal both the interior and exterior so that the draft is completely blocked. You can use spray foam insulation to get the job done quickly and efficiently. For smaller cracks where spray foam insulation won’t work, use caulk. This will seal the areas and can be smoothed out for neatness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3applyheatingtape\">3. Apply heating tape</h2>\n<p>If insulation is like a down blanket for your pipes, heating tape is an electric blanket. Heating tape is perfect for accessible pipes that need extra insulation from the cold weather. There are two types of heating tape: one that turns on and off by itself and one that has a manual switch.</p>\n<p>This adds necessary heat to the pipes to prevent freezing. Be careful using it, though. For your safety, follow the product’s instructions to prevent accidental fires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4runthefaucet\">4. Run the faucet</h2>\n<p>Running water doesn’t freeze. Fortunately, you don’t have to turn the water on full blast to get the benefits of running water. Turning faucets on so that there is a consistent drip is usually enough to prevent the pipe from freezing and bursting.</p>\n<p>Make sure to run both the faucet’s hot and cold water so that you don’t have one side freeze. If you have single-handle faucets like most kitchens, set the water to run warm so that an equal amount of hot and cold water goes through.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5keepcabinetdoorsopen\">5. Keep cabinet doors open</h2>\n<p>Areas under cabinets tend to get and stay cold because there’s no extra warm air circulating under the sink. Open cabinet doors so that the warmth of the room can help warm under the sink. Do this in your kitchen and bathrooms to make sure these areas get the benefit of the household’s warm air.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6keeptheheaton\">6. Keep the heat on</h2>\n<p>Keep the heat on in the house to keep pipes warm. You don’t need a full 75 degrees in the house during the winter, but if you plan on leaving for an extended period of time, keep the heat above 50 degrees Fahrenheit to help prevent freezing pipes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtothawafrozenpipe\">How to thaw a frozen pipe</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you can’t stop a pipe from freezing. If you come home to barely a trickle of water coming from your faucets, you may need to apply heat to the pipes sending water to the faucet. You can do this with a hair dryer, a portable space heater, or by wrapping towels soaked in hot water around the pipes.</p>\n<p>When heating pipes with things like a dryer or space heater, make sure to keep flammable materials away from the heat source to prevent a fire. Never, ever use a blowtorch, propane or kerosene heater, or any open flame to thaw your pipes.</p>\n<p>As the pipe is thawing, keep the faucet on to allow the water to flow through.</p>\n<p>If warming a pipe doesn’t resolve your water pressure problems, you likely have a frozen pipe somewhere you can’t easily access. If that’s the case, call a plumber for help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frozenpipesandhomeinsurance\">Frozen pipes and home insurance</h2>\n<p>Whether you have homeowners, condo, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>, these policies typically do cover frozen pipe damage (but ask your insurance representative to make sure!). That’s good news – frozen and burst pipes can cause thousands of dollars worth of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> to your home and your belongings. That’s especially true if the pipe bursts when you’re away from home and can’t catch the problem when it first happens.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"/claims/\">make a claim</a>, first turn the water off to stop the damage from escalating. Then call your insurance provider to report the event. Get personal belongings on shelves or surfaces where water can’t damage them. Take pictures of the problem and make sure the claims specialist has a list of all damaged items.</p>\n<p>While you’ll still need a plumber to fix the actual busted pipe right away, your policy can cover your damaged cabinets, flooring, walls, and personal belongings up to the coverage limits.</p>"

      title: "How to Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll Actually Keep"
      body: "<p>Anyone can <em>make</em> New Year’s resolutions. The real trick is figuring out how to <em>keep</em> New Year’s resolutions, right? But truthfully, a resolution is like any other goal. You need to decide what you want to accomplish and develop a plan to get it done.</p>\n<p>Whether you want to run a marathon, finally <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">stop killing your houseplants</a>, or <a href=\"/blog/saving-tips-first-time-homeowners/\">start saving for your first home</a>, you can make resolutions that actually stick. We’ve put together a few tips to help you set you off on the right path.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startwiththerightresolution\">Start with the Right Resolution</h2>\n<p>Becky Moore from {{< external-link url=\"https://globalgrasshopper.com/\" text=\"Global Grasshopper\" >}} believes that New Year’s resolutions are about “accepting responsibility for the things in your life that need improvement” and “owning the fact that you aren’t perfect, but that you can be better.” With this in mind, there are several types of resolutions you may want to avoid, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resolutions that come from someone else.</strong> Don’t pick a goal based on what others tell you that you need to do. If your family says you need to lose weight but you really don’t want to do it, you’ll have a hard time committing to that goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolutions that you haven’t carefully considered.</strong> Before you set a New Year’s resolution, figure out what really matters to you. People show more resiliency when working towards goals that reflect their truest selves.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolutions for the sake of having a resolution.</strong> Making a resolution simply because it’s New Year’s Eve and that’s what we do may be the surest way to guarantee failure. Again, if you’re not truly motivated by your goal, you’re going to have a hard time reaching it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"setsmartresolutions\">Set S.M.A.R.T. Resolutions</h2>\n<p>Entrepreneur Athena Oanessian, founder of You Squared, says it’s important to use the S.M.A.R.T. method for setting goals because it helps you think through your goals and understand what you need to achieve them.</p>\n<p>S.M.A.R.T. stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specific.</strong> Be explicit about what you want to accomplish. For example, “save money for a home” is a great goal, but a more specific goal includes the who, what, where, when, and why. Your ultimate goal might be “My spouse and I will buy a home in our neighborhood by the end of the year so we can have more space.”</li>\n<li><strong>Measurable.</strong> Quantifying your resolution (e.g., I will put an extra 10 percent from every paycheck towards buying a house) helps you track your progress and stay motivated.</li>\n<li><strong>Achievable.</strong> You want to ask yourself if your resolution is truly realistic given your time and resources. So if buying a home is your goal, then you may want to assess your current financial situation to see what you can afford.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant.</strong> Another important question to ask yourself is what does this goal mean to you. Are you buying a home because it’s what people are supposed to do or because it's something you really want? Does it fit your other life goals?</li>\n<li><strong>Timely.</strong> Creating a deadline for your goal, whether it’s a few months out or by the end of the year, can help keep you on track and give you space to create small, bite-sized goals. For example, you may want to buy a house by the end of the year, but maybe you need to raise your credit score first.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"breakyourresolutionintosmallgoals\">Break Your Resolution into Small Goals</h2>\n<p>Small, incremental steps are a good way to make progress toward one big resolution, according to Emily Mendez of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.theohanahawaii.com/\" text=\"The Ohana Addiction Treatment Center\" >}}, so she recommends breaking your resolutions down into several small steps.</p>\n<p>For example, if your resolution is to buy a home, then smaller goals like fixing your credit score or <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">researching mortgages</a> get you moving in the right direction. Making progress is also good for staying motivated. “We tend to give up on goals that we don’t see results right away on,” says Mendez.</p>\n<p>And as you progress, Bracha Goetz of {{< external-link url=\"http://www.goetzbookshop.com\" text=\"Bracha’s Books\" >}} points out that celebrating your victories, even if they’re just small steps toward your bigger goal, can increase your “gratitude and sense of abundance in life.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"writedownyourresolution\">Write Down Your Resolution</h2>\n<p>Cofounder of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.textel.net\" text=\"Textel\" >}} James Diel advises anyone who wants to keep a New Year’s resolution to “plan adequately by putting pen to paper and writing down not just your goals, but the strategy itself.” Writing your resolution down helps to clarify both your purpose and your method.</p>\n<p>Your next step may be to place your written resolutions somewhere that you can see them often, like your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. This gives you a constant reminder that may steel your resolve when obstacles get between you and your goal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"knowthattherewillbehurdles\">Know That There Will be Hurdles</h2>\n<p>The road to any successful resolution includes obstacles and missteps, so you need to understand that change is a process and that you’ll have days when you fall short. When that happens, Samantha Moss of {{< external-link url=\"https://romantific.com/about/\" text=\"Romaticific.com\" >}} encourages you to remember that, “Your resolution doesn’t end when you commit one mistake or engage in something you restrict yourself from. Let yourself adjust little by little.”</p>\n<p>The best piece of advice we can give? Be patient. Most <a href=\"/blog/new-years-resolutions-homeowners/\">New Year’s resolutions</a> are about changing habits, and that takes planning and time.</p>"

      title: "How to prep for a power outage"
      body: "<p>Power outages may not be high on your list of concerns in the grand scheme of things. However, they disrupt essential services throughout a community, such as communications and transportation. They can also mean your refrigerator, air conditioning, medical devices, and water all stop working.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it looks like we may be in for more power outages this summer. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC<em>SRA</em>2022.pdf\" text=\"issued a report\" >}} last month about the energy emergencies we may see during this summer. The report lists the Midwest, Texas, and Southern California as the areas with the most concern, but electrical disruptions can occur anywhere. Long story short? Everyone should learn how to prep for a power outage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcausespoweroutages\">What causes power outages?</h2>\n<p>Some of the most common causes of power outages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extreme heat.</strong> High temperatures increase wildfire risk that can cause downed transmission lines. Droughts can also wreak havoc with energy in areas that rely on hydropower.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather.</strong> Heat isn’t the only weather event that might cause a power outage. High winds, lightning, and ice can too. In some cases, utilities shut off power in the interest of public safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Equipment failure.</strong> Aging equipment can fail all on its own, but anything from a runaway car to a mischievous squirrel can cause damage and power outages.</li>\n<li><strong>High demand.</strong> The summer months often mean more people using air conditioning, and that can cause supply shortages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, being without power is inconvenient. But when it’s brought on by extreme weather conditions or goes on for a long time, a blackout can be a major problem. Here’s our tips on how to prepare for power outages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeapoweroutage\">What to do before a power outage</h2>\n<p>It’s important to develop a plan ahead of a blackout so that you aren’t left scrambling for the things you need. For example, you might want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Put together a disaster kit.</strong> Your {{< external-link url=\"https://example.com\" text=\"emergency preparedness kit\" >}} might include items like flashlights, batteries, cash, first aid supplies, and an emergency radio.</li>\n<li><strong>Get alternative charging methods for your electronics</strong>. Emergency radios, cell phone chargers, and flashlights are often solar-powered or use a hand crank. Another option for your phone is a battery pack that you keep charged and ready.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy a gas-powered generator.</strong> According to Goal Zero, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.goalzero.com/pages/consumer-power-report-pdf\" text=\"61% of people want a reliable backup energy source\" >}}, but only 15% actually have one. </li>\n<li><strong>Have “extras” on hand.</strong> Extra batteries seem pretty obvious, but you may also want bags of ice in case you need to use a cooler and extra gas for your generator.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep a full tank of gas.</strong> Gas pumps require electricity, and you want to have enough gas in your car to get you to safety should the need arise. While you’re checking your fuel gauge, take a minute to learn how to use the manual release lever on your electric garage door.</li>\n<li><strong>Sign up for local alerts</strong>. Your area may have a notification system that texts you with emergency information, like where you can find warming or cooling shelters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whattododuringapoweroutage\">What to do during a power outage</h2>\n<p>Power outages can be risky situations. They disrupt your routine and can leave you quite literally in the dark. Here are some ways you can reduce the chance of problems for your family and home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose battery-operated lights</strong>. Candlelight is lovely, but using a flashlight or lantern minimizes your risk of a fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Turn off all outlets except for one light.</strong> This lessens the likelihood of you overloading your circuits and damaging electronics if a <a href=\"/blog/what-causes-a-power-surge/\">power surge</a> runs through the house when the electricity goes back on.</li>\n<li><strong>Move to lower levels.</strong> During hot summer months, you may be able to stay cool by hanging out in the lower levels of your house. If not, consider going to a cooling shelter or shopping mall that is powered by backup generators to avoid dangerous heat.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep generators outside.</strong> This can limit fire risk and help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. The same goes for charcoal grills and camp stoves. And never use a gas stove to heat your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit trips to the refrigerator.</strong> Most freezers can keep their temperature for around 48 hours, but your fridge may only keep food cold for about four hours. Limiting the number of times you open and close your refrigerator door can help keep food from spoiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One important item to note: your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> most likely only covers power outage claims if the source of the outage originated on your property.

      title: "How to prepare for a hurricane in 6 steps"
      body: "<p>If it seems like hurricanes are getting worse, you’re not imagining it.</p>\n<p>Oceans are heating up, and that heat is affecting when and how storms form, as well as how they behave. While scientific models offer mixed predictions about how warming oceans are likely to affect the total number of hurricanes, they point to a <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00539.1\">45 to 87 percent increase</a> in the number of Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes – that is, those with the highest <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php?\">wind speeds</a>, which tend to be most destructive.</p>\n<p>While hurricanes themselves are changing, the best ways to prepare are not. Here, we’ll outline how to prepare for a hurricane before hurricane season and right before a storm. You'll also find tips on what you can do after the storm to reduce damage and return to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeahurricaneseasonalprep\">What to do before a hurricane: Seasonal prep</h2>\n<p>Hurricane preparation involves more than stashing a few gallons of water in the pantry and hoping for the best, so if you can, prepare well in advance of hurricane season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1makeahurricaneevacuationplan\">1. Make a hurricane evacuation plan</h3>\n<p>Most experts recommend making an evacuation plan before any actual hurricane is in the forecast. Acting early helps ensure that your plan is rational and well thought out, rather than an emotional response to the fear that a hurricane in the forecast can cause.</p>\n<p>Before you begin, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts\">Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> (WEAs) provided by the government are turned on, and <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/knowyourzone/\">check to see whether you’re in an evacuation zone</a> so you know ahead of time what to expect in the event of a storm.</p>\n<p>Make sure you evacuation plan outlines the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your evacuation route</strong>. Buy a relevant paper map in case digital communications are out when you have to evacuate.</li>\n<li><strong>Arrangements for where you’ll stay</strong>. This might mean making a primary plan to stay with friends or family who live out of the danger zone and a shelter fallback plan. If a storm is already looming and you can’t evacuate in time, have your <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/shelters/\">county’s shelter information</a> on hand. As you plan, don’t forget to accommodate your <a href=\"/blog/pet-insurance/\">pets</a>: remember that some shelters won’t take pets and that it’s best for yours to have all relevant paperwork with them (vaccination information, insurance documents, medical records, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>When you’ll evacuate</strong>. While it’s fine to wait until official channels issue an <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">evacuation order</a>, certain groups may wish to evacuate sooner to ensure they have plenty of time to get where they’re going. If you or someone you’ll be traveling with is elderly, has special needs, is pregnant, or is sick, you may want to plan an early evacuation to keep everyone safe. Those who live in mobile homes or low-lying coastal areas should generally evacuate early, and those who will be towing large vehicles may have to, as high winds can make driving these vehicles dangerous.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have a plan in place, communicate it with your household and any folks you plan to stay with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2gatherevacuationessentials\">2. Gather evacuation essentials</h3>\n<p>When you’ve planned how and when you’ll evacuate, it’s time to decide what you’ll bring. You can pack many of these items ahead of time, and it’s wise to do so to make the evacuation process as seamless as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png?width=940&name=FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Prepare yourself to bring the following if you evacuate for a hurricane:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A photo ID</li>\n<li>Medical essentials (medicine, glasses, equipment, etc.)</li>\n<li>A flashlight and extra batteries</li>\n<li>A battery-operated portable radio</li>\n<li>Bottled water</li>\n<li>Non-perishable foods</li>\n<li>Spare clothing and shoes</li>\n<li>Blankets</li>\n<li>Toiletries</li>\n<li>Important papers (<a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>, will, deed to your house, etc.)</li>\n<li>Contact information for loved ones, your doctor, and your insurance agent</li>\n<li>Cash and credit cards</li>\n<li>Extra gas for your car</li>\n<li>A first-aid kit</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">inventory of your belongings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3purchasehurricanesupplies\">3. Purchase hurricane supplies</h3>\n<p>Florida residents can prepare for a hurricane by purchasing without sales tax during the first week of hurricane season. (Learn about the <a href=\"https://floridarevenue.com/DisasterPrep/pages/default.aspx\">Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday</a>.) Most of the supplies you need will last at least a year, but it’s important to check on them to make sure you’re well equipped.</p>\n<p>These are the most important things to have stocked to prepare for hurricane season:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough water and canned food to last at least a week</li>\n<li>Flashlights or headlamps with a supply of extra batteries</li>\n<li>Candles and matches</li>\n<li>A whole-home generator</li>\n<li>Spare gasoline for your vehicles, generator, and any hand tools you might need for clearing fallen branches</li>\n<li>An ax in the attic in case there’s severe flooding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FEMA also offers some excellent <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit\">recommendations for building an emergency kit</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a generator and need to use it, don’t forget to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always operate the generator outdoors and away from open windows and doors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning or death.</li>\n<li>Always follow manufacturer's directions.</li>\n<li>Never try to power the house wiring by plugging the generator into a wall outlet, which runs the risk of electrocution.</li>\n<li>Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling to prevent ignition.</li>\n<li>Plug appliances directly into the generator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4reviewyourhomeinsurance\">4. Review your home insurance</h3>\n<p>At the start of hurricane season, read over your insurance policy to know what it covers and what it doesn't. Keep in mind that once a storm has been deemed a threat to anywhere in your state, you may not be able to make changes to your policy.</p>\n<p>Remember that homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover flood damage. You need to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for that protection.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that your <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> will apply for damage from hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>We mentioned above that you should have a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> of your belongings when you evacuate. This is mostly for insurance purposes: in the event of a disaster, pictures of your home and belongings can be vital for making insurance claims so you can replace your stuff and repair your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5getyourhomeready\">5. Get your home ready</h3>\n<p>Brace your home for potential impact. You may want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Secure soffits.</strong> Install stainless steel screws through fascia to the soffit. Apply sealant over the screws and let it set for 72 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain your roof.</strong> Secure loose shingles, make sure they're properly sealed, and install flashing around your chimney and skylights. Wind speeds of Category 1 hurricanes range from 74 to 95 miles per hour, which can easily rip off poorly attached roof shingles. Category 5 hurricanes have wind speeds of 157 miles per hour or more, which can cause total roof loss. Taking care of your roof now can help you qualify for <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">wind mitigation discounts</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Install</strong> <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\"><strong>hurricane shutters</strong></a> <strong>to protect your windows from impact.</strong> Plywood should only be used as a last-minute effort because it doesn't offer as much protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a wind-rated garage door</strong> to withstand storm pressure. You can also temporarily reinforce your existing garage door with a brace.</li>\n<li><strong>Seal cracks and gaps around windows, doors, and other openings.</strong> Gaps that seem small in dry weather can be the source of lots of water and big problems during a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure anything loose in your yard and store outdoor furniture,</strong> as high winds could send it flying. Ask your neighbors to do the same.</li>\n<li><strong>Trim tree branches</strong> that hang over your house or dying trees to prevent them from falling.</li>\n<li><strong>Back up your electronics to cloud storage</strong> and unplug your devices before a storm starts to prevent damage from electrical surges and power loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Put your refrigerator on the coldest setting</strong> to prepare for power outages and to protect your perishables.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"6prepareforfloodwaters\">6. Prepare for floodwaters</h3>\n<p>Flooding is the most costly and common type of storm damage, so it’s important to take measures to reduce the potential destruction to your home and belongings, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store valuables and important documents above the ground floor in a waterproof container.</li>\n<li>Make sure your sump pump is working properly and has a backup power source (usually either from a battery or pressure from the municipal water supply). If you don’t have a sump pump, have one installed.</li>\n<li>Block doors with <a href=\"http://www.nwclimate.org/severe-weather/hurricane-preparation-guide/flood-protection/\">sandbags and plastic or urethane foam</a>. Neither method is perfect, but both can help block the main entryway water has to your house.</li>\n<li>Consider keeping an ax in the attic in case of severe flooding, but understand that axing your way out of the attic is difficult and dangerous. In addition to an ax, consider storing a red or orange flag and a pole you can raise it on, should you need to alert rescuers that you’re in need of help.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lastminutehurricaneprep\">Last minute hurricane prep</h2>\n<p>If a storm's imminently approaching and you haven't prepared in advance, make sure you secure your home immediately. You can do that by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Closing all exterior and interior doors and windows</strong>, including the garage door. Doing so can reduce wind force on the roof by up to 30 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Making sure to charge your cell phone.</strong> SMS sometimes works after a storm when other methods of communication won't.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-app-text-messages\"><strong>Downloading the free FEMA app</strong></a> to receive real-time weather alerts from the National Weather Service targeted to your county. The app also has emergency tips for each type of event and emergency shelter listings.</li>\n<li><strong>Tidying up outdoors</strong> by storing outdoor furniture, closing gates, securing fences, tying down any fixtures in the yard, and storing tools and equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Storing your insurance provider's contact information</strong> and family you might need to contact after the storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Putting hurricane shutters in place.</strong> Plywood should only be used in place of shutters as a last-minute resort when tropical weather is imminent.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcing your garage door</strong> with a brace if it's not wind-rated.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps and cracks</strong> around windows, doors, pipes, electrical boxes, and vents.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing debris from your gutters</strong> and extending downspouts away from your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Securing loose shingles on your roof</strong> with stainless steel screws and sealant.</li>\n<li><strong>Move valuables,</strong> important documents, electronics, and furnitures to the second floor.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafterahurricane\">What to do after a hurricane</h2>\n<p>Even if you prepare for a hurricane perfectly, though, the storm might still cause damage. That’s just the nature of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Once the storm itself has passed, you’ll be faced with the job of recovering and getting your life back to normal. Here’s how to do that as safely and efficiently as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t return until there’s an official all-clear</strong>. If you evacuated, wait until authorities say it’s safe to return. Coming back too soon could strain already shaky infrastructure and put you and your family in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid flood waters</strong>. Whether you sheltered in place or evacuated, avoid wading and driving through floodwaters, which can contain debris and downed power lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat and drink with caution</strong>. Avoid drinking tap water until you’ve confirmed that it’s safe. Don’t eat refrigerated foods that were warmer than 40ºF for more than two hours. Emergency resources are likely to be constrained, so do everything in your power to avoid putting yourself in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Wear protective gear when cleaning</strong>. After a flood, anything from falling branches to <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">mold</a> could cause health problems, so proceed with caution as you clean up.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact your insurance provider</strong>. If your insurance provider hasn’t already reached out to you about coverage, reach out to communicate damage and start the process of filing claims. The sooner you do this, the sooner your home will be repaired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips, check out the EPA’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\">recovering from a hurricane</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneprepshouldbeanongoingproject\">Hurricane prep should be an ongoing project</h2>\n<p>Obviously, there are a lot of variables when it comes to preparing for bad weather. The important takeaway here is that there is no single right way to prepare for a hurricane, but you do have to prepare.</p>\n<p>Maybe the easiest way to do this is to work hurricane preparation into your normal home maintenance tasks: whenever you test your smoke alarms, check the expiration dates on your hurricane food supplies and replace anything that’s gone bad.</p>\n<p>Whenever you clean the gutters, ensure your spare gas supply is adequate.</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>When hurricane preparation becomes part of your ordinary home maintenance, you’ll be better prepared to weather any storm that blows your way.</p>"

      title: "How to Shop for Home Insurance in Louisiana"
      body: "<p>Louisiana is <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">one of the most expensive states for home insurance</a> because of its risk of flooding and hurricanes. In fact, the 2020 hurricane season proved especially rocky for the Bayou State as five hurricanes made landfall last year, breaking the state's record for {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nola.com/news/hurricane/article_d17ea1e2-2e5b-11eb-bcf4-f70bcbd968ee.html\" text=\"most hurricanes in a single season\" >}}.</p>\n<p>In other words: your home insurance needs to be up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>These tips can help you shop for <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">home insurance in Louisiana</a>, find a policy that fits your budget, and get peace of mind as <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> approaches. Let's get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1determineyourhomeownersinsuranceneeds\">1. Determine Your Homeowners Insurance Needs</h2>\n<p>Every <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy provides basic coverage that protects different parts of the home, such as your dwelling, personal belongings, and any additional structures. It can also cover costs if you face a lawsuit, have to temporarily relocate, or if a guest has an injury. While the coverages are standard, you get to decide how much you need of each.</p>\n<p>Basically, you’re trying to identify where your greatest risks are. For instance, let’s say you have a lot of stereo equipment and high-end electronics in your home. That may mean you want to take a good hard look at how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> you can afford. Or maybe you have a trampoline or a swimming pool that increases the risk of someone getting hurt on your property. In that case, you might want more <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Both these examples focus on increasing coverage to avoid being underinsured, but remember the reverse is true, too. Once you know where your risks are, you can pick the appropriate amount of coverage without being over insured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2haveyourpreviouspolicyhandy\">2. Have Your Previous Policy Handy</h2>\n<p>If you're shopping for home insurance to replace an existing policy, don’t shop without that policy in hand. You won’t know if a new policy is better or worse than your old one unless you compare them. Certain details can have a big impact on a policy’s cost and coverage, so be sure to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limits:</strong> Check that both premiums are based on similar coverage limits; otherwise, you may think you’re getting an incredible deal only to find out you actually have less coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Deductibles:</strong> Increasing your deductible, or the amount you owe in a claim, usually lowers your premium.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal belonging sub-limits:</strong> Insurers place sub-limits on certain valuables, so that they only have to pay a certain amount for them in a claim. These sub-limits can vary between insurers, so you want to know if you’re comparing policies with similar caps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you’re comparing apples-to-apples rather than just assuming a cheaper policy is the better deal. A closer look might show that the cheaper policy has less coverage across the board, leaving you exposed to big out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3getyourinformationready\">3. Get Your Information Ready</h2>\n<p>To get a quote with Kin, you need your home’s address and a couple details about your property. You may also need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">home inspection</a>, depending on your home's age.</li>\n<li>A security certificate to get a smart home security discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As long as you’re gathering this information, you might as well review it, too. Make note of any issues with your home mentioned in inspection reports that may indicate you need additional coverage. For instance, old plumbing may mean you need coverage for sewer backup. It protects you if your plumbing backs up and causes damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4knowwhatyourpersonalbelongingsareworth\">4. Know What Your Personal Belongings Are Worth</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners insurance policies offer property coverage based on a percentage of your dwelling coverage – usually from 20 to 50 percent. So if your home’s replacement cost is $200,000, your belongings may be covered for $20,000 to $100,000, depending on the default percentage you choose.</p>\n<p>This default coverage may or may not be enough for you. The best way to know is to do a rough inventory of your stuff. This includes appliances, electronics, furnishings, and wardrobe. While you don’t need a line-by-line inventory, the more detailed you are, the closer you can get to properly covering your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">how much homeowners insurance you may need</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5investigateyourfloodrisk\">5. Investigate Your Flood Risk</h2>\n<p>Many parts of Louisiana sit below sea level and are prone to flooding. Standard homeowners insurance policies don’t cover floods, so you usually need to take the extra step to address this big risk. You can use {{< external-link url=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\" text=\"FEMA’s map center\" >}} to get a better idea of your flood risk.</p>\n<p>Many insurance carriers rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to offer flood coverage, but the coverage it provides is limited. Kin, on the other hand, can offer a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance endorsement</a> that is not only comprehensive but costs as little as $175 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6learnabouthurricanedeductibles\">6. Learn about Hurricane Deductibles</h2>\n<p>Home insurance policies in Louisiana include a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>. This is a separate deductible from your \"All Other Perils (AOP)\" deductible. It only applies when your home experiences wind damage during a named storm.</p>\n<p>Hurricane deductibles in Louisiana typically run between two and five percent of the amount your home is insured for. So if your home is insured for $200,000 with a five percent hurricane deductible, you’d be responsible for $10,000 worth of any wind damage in a claim triggered by a named storm. But if your policy only requires a two percent deductible, your out-of-pocket costs go down to $4,000.</p>\n<p>Before you jump at the policy with the lower hurricane deductible, remember selecting the higher percentage usually reduces your premium. Ultimately, you have to weigh how much you can afford if your home is damaged in a hurricane against paying a higher premium for your homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>You should also note that a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2020/10/08/585935.htm\" text=\"Louisiana state law\" >}} prohibits homeowners from paying more than one hurricane deductible in a single hurricane season. With <a href=\"/blog/louisiana-hurricane-history/\">major named storms becoming more frequent</a>, this tidbit may come in handy if you’re on the coast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7askaboutdiscounts\">7. Ask about Discounts</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies often reward homeowners for behaviors that make their homes more attractive to insure. In Louisiana, you may get discounts if your house has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">hip-shaped roof</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">Wind mitigation features</a>, like impact-resistant covers on your glass openings.</li>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Water leak detection and mitigation devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some also have discounts if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are a new homebuyer.</li>\n<li>Live in a secured community.</li>\n<li>Haven’t filed claims.</li>\n<li>Opt for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to help you save as much money as possible and can find every discounts you're eligible for. Apply online for a fast and free quote.</p>"

      title: "How to Spot Contractor Fraud"
      body: "<p>Dealing with the aftermath of a major storm can be stressful. You’ve got cleaning up to do and insurance forms to fill out. Now imagine what could happen if you fell victim to contractor fraud. Not only would you still have the hassle of getting your home repaired, but you’d have the extra trouble of being overcharged for shoddy work and unnecessary repairs.</p>\n<p>Contractor fraud costs insurance companies a lot of money. In fact, the National Insurance Crime Bureau says property and casualty insurance companies paid up to $9.2 billion more in disaster claims due to insurance fraud in 2021. But ultimately, this cost ends up getting passed on to <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insureds</a> like you in the form of higher premiums. This is one of the reasons <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida homeowners rates are increasing</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscontractorfraud\">What Is Contractor Fraud?</h2>\n<p>Contractor fraud is when an individual contractor or a contracting firm purposely deceives another party over services. Some examples of contractor fraud include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking for an upfront payment and never completing the work.</li>\n<li>Making unnecessary repairs.</li>\n<li>Inventing problems that cost extra to fix.</li>\n<li>Charging for repairs they don’t make.</li>\n<li>Passing off used materials as new.</li>\n<li>Overcharging for services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One type of contractor fraud that has been impacting <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida home insurance</a> centers on <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignment of benefits</a> (AOB). It’s not uncommon for contractors to ask homeowners to sign an AOB that gives the contractor control of the homeowner’s <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>. Unfortunately, some fraudulent contractors inflate their costs and bill the <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> after they have the AOB in hand. Fraudulent contractors may even sue the insurer on your behalf when it refuses to pay the padded bill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fraudulentcontractorsredflagsforhomeowners\">Fraudulent Contractors: Red Flags for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>Nobody wants to be the victim of an <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">assignment of benefits scam</a>, or any type of contractor fraud for that matter. To help you avoid schemes, we’ve compiled a list of red flags for homeowners.</p>\n<p>Beware of contractors that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Approach you about damage you didn’t know you had.</strong> If a contractor claims you have damage, make sure they show you evidence.</li>\n<li><strong>Promise free repairs.</strong> A contractor might swear that you can get a free roof through your insurance company.</li>\n<li><strong>Begins repairs before your insurer inspects your damages.</strong> While you do want to mitigate your damages, you have to remember that <a href=\"/faq/insurance-loss-inspection/\">loss inspections</a> are a typical part of any claims filing.</li>\n<li><strong>Seem unprofessional.</strong> You want to be wary of any contractor who has contracts with typos and grammatical errors, who can’t provide basic business information, or who won’t show you their business insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Require full payment in advance.</strong> A contractor may ask for some money upfront to cover materials, but 10 percent of the total estimate is the norm. Asking for 50 percent or more is a sign that something is amiss..</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t pay suppliers.</strong> At least some of your down payment should go towards labor and materials. Contractors who don’t pay the suppliers may be taking that as profit for themselves, leaving you to deal with the supplier on your own.</li>\n<li><strong>Are from another state.</strong> Contractors sometimes flock to disaster areas looking for work. However, working with out-of-state contractors is risky because they may not be licensed in your state.</li>\n<li><strong>Continually find new problems.</strong> It isn’t uncommon for a contractor to find another issue when they open up walls and get behind cabinets, but finding several problems may be a red flag. If possible, get a second opinion to make sure it really is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</li>\n<li><strong>Say they don’t need permits.</strong> Permits exist to protect you and make sure that the work meets building codes and city ordinances. Legitimate contractors will always pull a permit for major work.</li>\n<li><strong>Requires cash.</strong> Reputable contractors are usually prepared to take checks or credit cards. If a contractor says they’re a cash-only business, then demand a receipt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These signs indicate that something is wrong with your contractor, but they’re not the only red flags. In general, you want to trust your gut.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyoususpectcontractorfraud\">What To Do If You Suspect Contractor Fraud</h2>\n<p>Your first step if you suspect that a contractor is trying to scam you is to start documenting your concerns. Record the work that’s been completed and hold on to any paperwork between the two of you, such as contracts, receipts, and canceled checks. Then talk to your contractor about your concerns. Your contractor may have legitimate reasons for delays and is willing to work with you to make sure your repairs are completed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you may have to contact the Better Business Bureau or the state contractor licensing authority.</p>"

If you’re new to gardening, start small and plan well so you can have vegetables you grew yourself on your dinner table this summer.</p>\n<p>And don't worry – you don't need a green thumb to have a thriving vegetable garden. These are tips anyone can put into action, regardless of your gardening experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosetherightspot\">Choose the Right Spot</h2>\n<p>You don’t need a lot of space for an abundant garden. In fact, most experts recommend a space that’s no bigger than 10’ x 10’ when you first start out to keep your garden manageable. Depending on your yard, you may want to start even smaller, especially as you think about how much sun and water you need.</p>\n<p>Vegetables typically need at least six hours of direct sunlight every day, so you want to choose a spot that's fairly exposed. However, if you live in an area where the summer sun will beat down on your plants, look for an area that gets some afternoon shade. This will give your plants relief for part of the day.</p>\n<p>Check the soil and make sure the area has good drainage. If your soil has lots of sand or clay, you can mix in organic matter to improve it. You need about two to three inches of organic matter for clay soil and an extra inch to sandy soil. Compost or well-rotted manure are the best for soil health. Adding organic material also helps the soil texture to better absorb the water your seed needs while still allowing it to drain at the right speed.</p>\n<p>If you don't opt for a raised garden bed, you may want to surround your vegetable garden with a border – perhaps decorative edging or flowers. This not only makes it easy to see where you need to tend, but it can help keep pets (and pests!) out.</p>\n<p>One important note regarding gardens and your home’s value: most people know that complimentary landscaping goes a long way toward <a href=\"/blog/home-and-garden-curb-appeal/\">increasing your home’s curb appeal</a>. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean a veggie garden will have the same effect. Not everyone wants to do the work a garden requires, so consider using raised beds if you’re thinking about moving in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stockuponsuppliesandtools\">Stock Up on Supplies and Tools</h2>\n<p>Having the right tools and supplies make starting a vegetable garden much easier. Here are some must-haves to put on your list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water hose</li>\n<li>Spray nozzle</li>\n<li>Garden gloves</li>\n<li>Trowel</li>\n<li>Garden forks</li>\n<li>Garden stakes</li>\n<li>Dandelion weeder</li>\n<li>Fruit and vegetable fertilizer</li>\n<li>Fruit and vegetable disease control</li>\n<li>Insect control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also need other things based on your location and the vegetables you plant. For example, gardens where there’s more wildlife benefit from protective fencing, and tall plants like tomatoes require a trellis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pickyourvegetables\">Pick Your Vegetables</h2>\n<p>Now for the fun part: pick the vegetables you want to grow. If you’ve decided to go with a 100 square foot garden (that’s the 10’ by 10’ one we mentioned earlier), then you want three to five types of vegetables and three to five plants of each type.</p>\n<p>As a beginner, you want to choose vegetables that are easy to grow and that you and your family enjoy eating. Here are some popular low-maintenance options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tomatoes</li>\n<li>Peppers</li>\n<li>Squash</li>\n<li>Carrots</li>\n<li>Radishes</li>\n<li>Corn</li>\n<li>Lettuce</li>\n<li>Greens</li>\n<li>Peas</li>\n<li>Broccoli</li>\n<li>Eggplant</li>\n<li>Potatoes</li>\n<li>Kale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and squash only need to be planted once to continuously produce fruits and vegetables. Others, like carrots, radishes, and corn, need to be replanted after a harvest.</p>\n<p>Timing is important, too. Lettuce, greens, peas, and radishes are great to plant in early spring because they do better in the cooler weather of the season. When the weather warms up, you can add tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and herbs. Vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, and kale are best timed for fall harvests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plantyourvegetablegarden\">Plant Your Vegetable Garden</h2>\n<p>You can plant your garden using seeds or plants at various stages of growth purchased at your local garden store. Seeds are usually more expensive and take longer to produce crops compared to starter plants. However, starter plants can be easier for new gardeners to grow because you can plant them when there’s no more danger of frost in your area.</p>\n<p>Whether you go with seeds or starter plants, the actual steps to planting a vegetable garden are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a trowel to dig a hole two times deeper and wider than your plant:</strong> This gives your plants enough space for their roots to take hold and for their leaves to get plenty of sunlight and air circulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Place plants in holes and cover them with soil:</strong> Compact the soil around them, and be sure to not bury them deeper than what they were in their containers. You should also add garden stakes to vine plants such as tomatoes and beans so that they can grow vertically.</li>\n<li><strong>Water your seeds or new plants immediately after planting:</strong> Plants and seeds need water right away to help them settle in, but you also want to water them whenever the soil is starting to dry out approximately a half inch from the top.</li>\n<li><strong>Fertilize your plants:</strong> A new location can be stressful on fledgling plants, so give them some TLC in the form of extra nutrients. Vegetable fertilizer can build stronger root systems, stalks, and leaves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"maintainyourgarden\">Maintain Your Garden</h2>\n<p>One thing veteran gardeners will tell you when you’re learning how to start a vegetable garden is how important it is to care for your plants. A well-tended 10’ by 10’ vegetable garden will yield more produce than an untended 10’ by 25’ garden, so make gardening part of your routine.</p>\n<p>Your first concern should be water. The soil should be moist, and that means that you need to water your vegetables every couple of days – and probably every day during really hot summers. The best time to water is in the late afternoon or early evening when plants can spend the night recovering from the day’s stresses.</p>\n<p>If you’re worried that you’ll forget to water your plants or your best source for water is a bit of a haul, consider a drip irrigation system or a soaker hose to keep everything hydrated. You can even get a timer that turns these on and off so you don’t overwater your plants.</p>\n<p>Next, make sure you keep weeds out of your vegetable garden. You don’t want to let the weeds take over and choke out your plants. It's best to tackle weeds when they’re small and easily pulled out by the root, so check for them regularly. To get the stubborn weeds with deep roots, you can use a dandelion weeder. This allows you to get directly under the weed and pop it out from the roots.</p>\n<p>Finally, fertilize your vegetable garden regularly. Most experts agree that you should add fertilizer to the soil every three to four weeks. That’s true even when crops start to appear so that your plants continue to get the nourishment they need to grow and produce vegetables.</p>\n<p>We’d love to end this with a happy, “And that’s all there is to it!” But learning how to start a vegetable garden and tending to it throughout the growing season requires consistent attention. Just remember that your efforts will be rewarded with healthy fresh food for you and your family.</p>"

      title: "How Toxic Is Your Home?"
      body: "<p>Is your home brimming with dangerous chemicals? Probably not. But this guide can help you figure out the toxic items that should be stored with care.</p>\n<p>Hearing about toxins in the home is enough to make any homeowner nervous – especially if you just bought your house or you’re planning to stay there for the long haul. But the reality is that some substances commonly found in American households can have a negative impact on your health or wellbeing – not to mention that of the planet.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll offer some insight into products and substances that might contain toxic chemicals or that have been linked to negative side effects. We’ll also offer alternatives that are easy to find, effective, and inexpensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backgroundavoidingtoxindoomgloom\">Background: Avoiding Toxin Doom &amp; Gloom</h2>\n<p>Before we dig in, here’s a disclaimer: there’s a lot of pseudoscience out there about “toxins” and “chemicals.” For the purposes of this guide, we’re proceeding with the following assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Everything is made up of chemicals, and not all chemicals are harmful! (E.g., the chemical composition of water is hydrogen and oxygen.)</li>\n<li>Most household products sold commercially are mostly safe, thanks to the many safety regulations they have to adhere to.</li>\n<li>Despite the above, some substances can have harmful effects on people or animals even if they’re used properly. These effects are often either discovered by new research that wasn’t available when a product was approved or only happen to a small portion of the population.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, nothing in this guide is intended to be diagnostic. It’s merely informational. If you have any concerns about a health condition, you should consult your physician. If someone in your home has ingested a substance you think is toxic, <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/\">contact poison control</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everything is made up of chemicals, and not all chemicals are harmful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part1householdtoxinsinplainsightandalternatives\">Part 1: Household Toxins in Plain Sight (and Alternatives)</h2>\n<p>In this section, we’ll highlight common household substances that are harmful if used improperly. These are substances that you may not be able to get around using in your daily life but that you want to keep away from children and pets, who might try to eat them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allpurposecleanersotherhouseholdcleaners\">All-purpose cleaners &amp; other household cleaners</h3>\n<p>Some of the heavy-duty all-purpose cleaners out there can irritate your skin and your respiratory system and can be toxic if swallowed. Even “specialized” cleaners (for toilets, mirrors, mold, ovens, carpet / upholstery, drains, and furniture) often have ingredients that irritate our systems. Common dangerous ingredients include ammonia, ethylene glycol, monobutyl acetate, sodium hypochlorite, and trisodium phosphate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Wear latex gloves when using these cleaners, and open windows and doors to improve airflow. Never mix two cleaners (ammonia and bleach create a poisonous gas when combined).</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: You can clean most stuff in your home with some combination of baking soda, vinegar, lemons, and hydrogen peroxide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"antifreeze\">Antifreeze</h3>\n<p>Fumes from ethylene glycol-based antifreeze can make you dizzy. Ingesting it can be deadly. This substance has a sweet smell, so pets might be attracted to it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Store in a sealed container out of reach of children and pets. Clean up spills quickly, and wear gloves to do so, because it’s possible to absorb it through your skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: Propylene glycol-based antifreeze.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"batteries\">Batteries</h3>\n<p>Wet-cell batteries (like those in car engines) contain sulfuric acid and lead. They’re sealed, but if the seal is broken, fumes from the acid can cause irritation, and the acid itself can cause skin damage and even blindness (if it gets in your eyes).</p>\n<p><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Clean the area if a battery’s seal is broken. Wash your hands immediately after. Keep kids and pets away from all batteries (especially those they can swallow).</p>\n<h3 id=\"bleach\">Bleach</h3>\n<p>Aka <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=928&tid=192\">sodium hypochlorite</a>. This stuff can irritate skin and breathing passages and can be deadly if ingested. If it’s <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool</a>-strength bleach, the concentration is higher than what you’d use for household cleaning, so be aware that it’s more potent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Wear latex gloves while handling and wash skin immediately if contact occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Plenty (for household cleaning)! Hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice – it depends on what you’d use the bleach for. Jump down to “Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic” for more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"insecticides\">Insecticides</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re spraying yourself, de-bugging your home, or treating your <a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">pets</a> for fleas or ticks, insect killers can cause problems to more than just our six- (or eight-) legged friends (foes?).</p>\n<p><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Broadly, follow instructions on the container. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid petting your dogs or cats for 24 hours after applying tick and flea treatments (or, more realistically, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after petting).</li>\n<li>If you’re using a “bug bomb” indoors, seal off the area being treated and get all people and pets outside the house during the treatment. After, clean every surface food might touch (tables, plates, cups, etc.) and get some air circulating.</li>\n<li>If possible, spray your clothes with insecticide rather than your skin. Shower as soon as you can when you get indoors.</li>\n<li>Avoid spraying insecticides near food.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"laundrydishdetergent\">Laundry &amp; dish detergent</h3>\n<p>We’ve all heard about the dangers of Tide pods, and with good reason: the enzymes used to loosen dirt from clothing can cause nausea, vomiting, shock, convulsions, and coma if ingested. Dish soap can also cause nausea, though it’s not usually fatal. But even without swallowing detergents, excessive exposure can cause <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743221\">respiratory problems</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Keep detergent away from children, especially if you use “fun”-looking pods.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Luckily, <a href=\"https://www.greenmatters.com/living/2017/06/22/iKecy/healthiest-laundry-detergents\">non-toxic alternatives to laundry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/guides/categories/5-Dishwashing\">dish detergent</a> are pretty widely available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mothballs\">Moth balls</h3>\n<p>In addition to smelling terrible, these things contain <a href=\"http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/mothball/health.html\">naphthalene and p-dichlorobenzene</a>, which can cause headaches, dizziness, and irritation to the skin and eyes. Over time, they might even lead to cataract formation or liver damage. Eek!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: If you decide to use mothballs anyway, make sure kids and pets can’t get at them.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Blessedly, there are safer and <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-to-prevent-get-rid-of-fabr-109733\">better-smelling alternatives</a>. Moths hate the smell of cedar, lavender, rosemary, thyme, mint, ginseng, eucalyptus, peppercorns, lemon, and cloves. Try sachets or essential oils with these scents to keep the moths at bay. And remember: it’s the smell that bothers them, so refresh these every few months or as the smell fades.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"motoroil\">Motor oil</h3>\n<p>Motor oil can absorb heavy metals that are toxic to humans and animals. Disposed of improperly, motor oil can contaminate groundwater. If ingested, the substance can cause vomiting and <a href=\"https://www.poison.org/articles/my-child-just-took-a-swig-of-motor-oil-173\">aspiration</a> (i.e., drawing the liquid into the lungs, especially while vomiting). Aspiration is serious and usually requires an ER visit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Dispose of used motor oil in a sealed plastic container. Don’t put it in the trash (that’s illegal). Instead, call your local auto parts store about options for recycling the oil.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: None, really. Just handle safely!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"windshieldwasherfluid\">Windshield washer fluid</h3>\n<p>This stuff contains methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol, which can be deadly if ingested, which should be no surprise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle safely</strong>: Keep it in a sealed container, out of reach of children.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternatives</strong>: You can <a href=\"https://www.diynatural.com/homemade-windshield-washer-fluid/\">make your own</a>, but it’s worth noting that the stuff you buy at the store is really only harmful if you drink it.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in doubt, read the label and follow directions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part2hiddenhouseholdtoxinsandalternatives\">Part 2: Hidden Household Toxins (and Alternatives)</h2>\n<p>Chances are, you already had a general idea about most of what we mentioned in part one: it’s not exactly a secret that ingesting non-food substances can be toxic. In this section, we’ll dive into some potentially toxic substances that might be hiding in harmless-seeming stuff around your house.</p>\n<p>One quick note: reading this information can get overwhelming. Most of us are using a lot of the products listed here. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, jump to Part 3: Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic. While there are a lot of potential household toxins out there, the changes you’ll need to make to eliminate them are fairly simple – and often, one change gets rid of several problematic substances at once.</p>\n<p>Okay. Deep breath. Here we go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"atrazine\">Atrazine</h3>\n<p>The second-most-widely used herbicide in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=336&tid=59\">atrazine</a> is famous (or maybe infamous) for causing male fish and frogs develop female genitalia. In humans, it can cause infertility. It may also be carcinogenic, but researchers haven’t yet gathered enough information to make a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: The easiest way to avoid atrazine is by eating organic food and reducing your meat consumption. Why less meat? Many animals eat corn, which is often treated with atrazine, which can bring the substance into your body. If you can find meat from organic-fed animals, you may be safer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bisphenolabpa\">Bisphenol A (BPA)</h3>\n<p>This is a component in plastics and is used in water bottles, on receipts, and in canned food linings. It’s what’s called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A\">xenoestrogen</a>, meaning that it behaves somewhat like the hormone and can also interact with sex hormones in the human body. While the substance is controversial, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm064437.htm?_cldee=a2F0aHJ5bl9zdGpvaG5AYW1lcmljYW5jaGVtaXN0cnkuY29t\">authorities in the US</a> and <a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150121\">Europe</a> haven’t found enough evidence to definitively link it to any negative health outcomes – but some people are still proceeding with caution.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: The good news here is that you can avoid BPA pretty easily. Manufacturers aren’t required to disclose its use, but you can assume that if a metal can isn’t labeled “BPA-free,” it has the substance in its lining. Avoid BPA by choosing those cans that are labeled “BPA-free,” or choosing glass jars or fresh or frozen food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dioxins\">Dioxins</h3>\n<p>These substances (and similar substances like DDT and PCBs) are a byproduct of industrial processes like paper bleaching and trash incineration. In the body, they’ve been linked to decreased fertility, diabetes, cancer, endometriosis, immune system problems, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: The bad news is that <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dioxins-and-their-effects-on-human-health\">nobody can avoid dioxins altogether</a>. But you can reduce the amount you take into your body by limiting the amount of fatty animal products you consume. That’s because dioxins are stored in animals’ fatty tissues. Note: going organic here won’t help because dioxins come from air and water rather than animals’ food supply.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flameretardants\">Flame retardants</h3>\n<p>Flame retardants are in lots of stuff: furniture, kids’ supplies, bedding, and more. Some of the substances in them (including polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs) have been <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=900&tid=94\">linked</a> to fertility problems, thyroid problems, and neurobehavioral changes in the young – but at this point, most of those findings are from animal studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Actually, don’t avoid them! Flame retardants can save your life and your home. To minimize the impact of any toxic substances they contain, dust and vacuum your home regularly. The toxic parts get into your system by binding to dust particles; the less dust, the less damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"formaldehyde\">Formaldehyde</h3>\n<p>This baby’s a nasty one. A <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet\">known carcinogen</a>, it can also cause respiratory and eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, and headaches in the <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=218&tid=39\">short term</a>. Far from being confined to the labs of mad scientists to preserve newts, formaldehyde is present in pressed-wood products (particleboard, wood paneling, plywood), foam insulation, latex paints, wallpaper, some synthetic fabrics, and some personal care products.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: Choose hardwood furniture when possible (you can ask for a formaldehyde testing report). Invest in air-filtering plants like the bamboo palm or the <a href=\"/blog/beginners-guide-to-houseplants/\">peace lily</a> to help keep your home’s air toxin-free.</p>\n<h3 id=\"glycolethers\">Glycol ethers</h3>\n<p>We mentioned earlier that glycol-based substances might be in your antifreeze or windshield fluid. Glycol ethers are also found in dry cleaning chemicals, some personal care products, and some home cleaners.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Skip dry cleaning whenever possible and make your own cleaning products at home. Tips and recipes for doing that in Part 3!</p>\n<h3 id=\"lead\">Lead</h3>\n<p>Lead causes a lot of well-documented health problems, including impaired development of the brain and nervous system. Newer research suggests it may also affect the body’s ability to regulate stress hormones.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: For most people, the biggest risk of lead exposure is via paint, which legally contained lead in the United States <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips.htm\">until 1978</a>. In some parts of the country, lead in the water is also a problem, in part because of lead pipes and socioeconomic inequalities that we won’t get into right now.</p>\n<p>The best ways to avoid lead are these:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your house is older than 1978, assume there’s lead paint in it. Consider renovating to eliminate the lead, but consult a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-abatement-inspection-and-risk-assessment\">lead remediation professional</a> first. If you’re pregnant, avoid the renovation area.</li>\n<li>If you live in an area with lead in the water, buy a <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2016/02/how-filter-lead-your-tap-water\">filter</a> that can eliminate it.</li>\n<li>Eat a healthy diet, as that can help your body absorb less lead.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mercury\">Mercury</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health\">Mercury</a> is most dangerous to young children and pregnant women (because it can hurt the development of the fetus). It can be toxic to the nervous system, digestive system, immune system, and can damage the lungs, eyes, skin, and kidneys.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: In the United States, most people’s biggest exposure comes from seafood. Limit your consumption to animals low on the food chain – generally, the smaller the animal, the less mercury it contains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organophosphatepesticides\">Organophosphate pesticides</h3>\n<p>These pesticides are very common and have been tied to a number of health problems, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560399/\">cardiovascular diseases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20435691\">endocrine disruption</a> (though more research may be needed to show a definitive link).</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: The easiest way to avoid these toxins is to choose organic food.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perchlorate\">Perchlorate</h3>\n<p>Used in rocket fuel, this chemical can prevent your thyroid from absorbing iodine properly. And your thyroid needs iodine to function.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid it</strong>: Unfortunately, you really can’t: it’s in groundwater, food, and more. But if you get enough iodine in your diet, you’ll diminish its impact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfluorinatedchemicalspfcs\">Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs)</h3>\n<p>Branded as Teflon and Stainmaster, these toxins can <a href=\"http://www.ncceh.ca/sites/default/files/Health_effects_PFCs_Oct_2010.pdf\">impact the function of the thyroid</a> and have been linked to infertility in men and women.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: PFCs are primarily used to make “non-stick” dishes and cooking utensils and to make products stain-, water-, or grease-repellant (pizza boxes, microwave popcorn bags, pet food bags, etc.).</p>\n<p>Opt for stainless steel, copper, or cast iron cooking gear, and for clothing that’s made waterproof with polyurethane rather than Gore-tex. Opt for glass containers to store food. If you’re a popcorn fanatic (as this writer is), <a href=\"https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-make-stove-top-popcorn/\">learn how to make stovetop popcorn</a>. It’s super easy and way more delicious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"phthalates\">Phthalates</h3>\n<p>Phthalates are used to keep plastic flexible and sturdy. They’re found in all kinds of materials: vinyl products like shower curtains, PVC plastics, synthetic scents, nail polish, fake leather, and some plastic food containers. Some forms of phthalates are <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=377&tid=65\">known carcinogens</a>. In the shorter term, contact with phthalates can cause nausea, respiratory system irritation, stomach irritation, damage to the central nervous system, liver and kidney damage, headaches, and loss of coordination.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid them</strong>: Whenever possible, choose glass or metal to store food. Opt for natural fibers (like cotton) and choose a nylon (or other non-vinyl) shower curtain. Avoid synthetic scents. Note: these compounds made some cool plastic applications possible, but they’re an <a href=\"https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/repair/vinyl-siding-lethal1.htm\">environmental bummer</a> at every stage of their lifecycle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While there are a lot of potential household toxins out there, the changes you’ll need to make to eliminate them are fairly simple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"part3simplewaystomakeyourhomelesstoxic\">Part 3: Simple Ways to Make Your Home Less Toxic</h2>\n<p>So the bad news is that there are a lot of potentially toxic substances in most people’s homes. But the good news is that making a few simple changes can greatly reduce your exposure to household toxins. As an added benefit, many of these changes will also allow you to save money and reduce your environmental impact. A win-win-win.</p>\n<p>Here are four simple changes to try.</p>\n<h3 id=\"switchoutnonstickpans\">Switch out nonstick pans</h3>\n<p>As we mentioned above, cast-iron, stainless steel, and copper cookware are all less-toxic alternatives to Teflon. If you don’t have a huge budget, check out second-hand stores and flea markets for some killer deals. Because of their chemical composition, these replacement pots and pans are typically safe even in an “encore life.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"brewyourowncleaningproducts\">Brew your own cleaning products</h3>\n<p>You can replace pretty much any toxic cleaning agent with some combination of these ingredients (<a href=\"https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/non-toxic-home-cleaning/\">full recipes</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baking soda</li>\n<li>White vinegar</li>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n<li>Cornstarch</li>\n<li>Olive or vegetable oil</li>\n<li>Hydrogen peroxide</li>\n<li>Washing soda</li>\n<li>Oxygen bleach</li>\n<li>Lemon juice and peels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to get fancy, you can add essential oils to your concoctions so they smell the way you like.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buyorganicfood\">Buy organic food</h3>\n<p>Yes, organic food is more expensive. But if you can afford it, swapping organics for food grown with chemical fertilizer can cut a lot of your toxin exposure. And don’t feel like this is an all-or-nothing proposition. If you’re on a tight budget, focus on getting organic versions of the “<a href=\"https://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/news/2018-dirty-dozen-and-clean-fifteen-lists-rank-produce-items-by-pesticide-level/\">dirty (baker’s) dozen</a>” foods – those that tend to absorb the highest levels of toxic chemicals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"switchoutplasticcontainers\">Switch out plastic containers</h3>\n<p>Plastic is everywhere, but it’s not great for the planet and it may also leech toxic substances into your food and beverages. The solution? Switch to glass or stainless steel containers to the extent possible. Again, you can find great deals at secondhand shops to avoid spending an arm and a leg.</p>\n<p>One final thought here: there’s no such thing as a toxin-free home, but if you’re trying to reduce the number of substances that can cause irritation in the short term and that might have serious negative health consequences in the long term, making small changes like these can help.</p>"

      title: "Hurricane Ida: A Recap of Kin’s Disaster Response"
      body: "<p>Hurricane Ida was a fast developing storm, escalating from tropical storm to Category 1 in a matter of hours. By August 29, 2021, Ida reached Category 3 only to intensify to a Category 4 in an hour. The storm ultimately became one of the most damaging and deadly hurricanes to hit Louisiana, tying Hurricane Laura and the 1856 Last Island Hurricane as the strongest in the state. And, of course, the destruction didn’t end there as the remnants of Ida caused heavy rains, flash floods, and tornados in the Northeast.</p>\n<p>Hurricane Ida is a good reminder of just how quickly a storm can build into something dangerous. It's our job to help customers weather both the storm and its aftermath.</p>\n<p>Here's a look at how we use technology to triage catastrophic claims and keep our customers prepared.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Srd-FX-5BC4?autoplay=0&rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><em>Video Transcript</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 1): We have ominous news coming from the Hurricane Hunters as they continue to track Hurricane Ida.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): The National Hurricane center is warning that Ida will bring life-threatening storm surge, potentially catastrophic wind damage, and flooding rainfall.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper, Co-founder & CEO): Climate change unfortunately is actually accelerating; it's intensifying. And in a decade, there really won't be anywhere to run from it. It's the new normal and we're prepared to meet these challenges head-on while helping our customers to do the same.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): The effects of Ida are already being felt, a Category 3 hurricane, wind up to 120 miles per hour as it makes landfall in Cuba.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Angel Conlin, Chief Insurance Officer): Hurricane Ida is a reminder to all homeowners that storms can rapidly intensify into life-threatening events, so we really need to prepare. At Kin, we truly care about our customers' safety. We're here for them in the long term and in emergent situations. We work to educate our members on ways they can harden their homes to better withstand storms and other events. That's one of the reasons Kin continuously monitors catastrophic events that could reach our customers. We analyze potentially developing storms, track the path of events, and model the potential impact on our policyholders. This allows us to be there for our members when they need us most.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper): Technology is really important in insurance, and it's at the center of everything that we do.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt, VP of Data Science): We're able to combine tons of data in near real-time in order to understand the impact of various events. So, for instance, when Ida was coming, we were able to take data from the National Hurricane Center and other data sources and take that that layer of geospatial data and overlay it on our book of policies to understand how our policyholders might be impacted by the storm.</em></p>\n<p>_(Angel Conlin): Ida's path had enough certainty that we triggered our automated pre-event text messages to all of our members in the projected path of the storm. With our pre-event texts, we proactively let our customers know the storm was coming and we provided custom resources with safety tips and ways they could prepare for the hurricane.</p>\n<p>(News anchor 2): Hurricane Ida is forecast to be a large, powerful, dangerous hurricane, a category 4 at landfall._</p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt): 24 hours before landfall, residents were evacuating. To help our members stay safe, we sent a second pre-event text that encouraged policyholders to download the FEMA app for weather alerts, shelter listings, and safety tips. We also continued to update our lists of customers who may be impacted by low risk, moderate risk, and potentially high-risk wind speeds. That allowed us to closely monitor high-risk properties for damage and customer safety.</em></p>\n<p><em>(News anchor 2): Five hours after landfall, Hurricane Ida was still a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 miles an hour.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Clay Rising, VP of Claims): Ida made landfall on August 29, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was the most devastating and costly hurricane in Louisiana's history. Because of Kin's use of technology and data science, our experienced claims team was well prepared to support our customers. As soon as the storm passed, we sent wellness checks to all of our members in the path to make sure they were safe and to determine how we could help. Our policyholders texted back with insights that helped us understand the ground impact of the storm in real time.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Adam Sturt): If a customer notifies us that they've evacuated, we're able to flag them for immediate post-storm review using aerial imagery.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Clay Rising): After a major event, it can take a few days to get adjusters on the ground, but because we have aerial imagery that shows a roof is damaged or not, we don't have to wait for boots on the ground to know that a home has been damaged. So we can get the process started and pay customers for damage faster. A lot of methods of communication change after a major storm ‚ there's no power, no internet, no cell phone service. So we have to adapt and contact people any way possible and get claims started via text message because it's often the only form of communication that's working.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Angel Conlin): By day five, we had aerial imagery available for 94 percent of our affected policyholders.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Sean Harper): We're always keeping the customer in the loop so that they know what's happening and what they should be doing to prepare. In terms of sustained maximum wind speed at landfall, Hurricane Ida ties with Hurricane Laura and the 1856 Last Island Hurricane. These are the strongest storms on record to make landfall in Louisiana. Then it went on and it caused major flash floods throughout the Northeast, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. This is a reminder that our climate is changing faster than ever. Storms like Ida will be the new normal. Our customers deserve an insurance company that is prepared for it.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"usingtechnologytopredicthurricaneidaspath\">Using Technology to Predict Hurricane Ida’s Path</h2>\n<p>Technology is the backbone of everything we do at Kin, so the moment we learned there was a potentially cataclysmic event developing in the Caribbean, we put that tech to work. We began tracking Ida’s path before it ever hit Cuba, using geospatial data from the National Hurricane Center and layering it on top of our book of business. This allowed us to anticipate who among our policyholders were most likely going to feel the effects of the storm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alertingpolicyholderstotheupcomingstorm\">Alerting Policyholders to the Upcoming Storm</h3>\n<p>But that prediction is most useful when we share it with the people who may be in harm’s way, so the next step was to send out the first of two pre-event texts. This text alerted our policyholders who we predicted to be in Ida’s path that they may be vulnerable to hurricane damage and provided them with custom resources and tips to keep them and their property safe.</p>\n<p>That first pre-event text went out on August 27﹘two days before Ida made landfall in Louisiana. The very next day we sent the second pre-event text. By then, Louisianans were evacuating, so this text encouraged our policyholders to download the Federal Emergency Management Agency app for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weather alerts.</li>\n<li>Shelter locations.</li>\n<li>Additional safety tips.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this was going on, our team continued to collect data so we could update our list of customers in Ida’s path and categorize them by their potential degree of impact. We did this to keep an eye both on our customers’ safety and the areas with the highest probability for damage and claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howaerialimageryspeedsuphurricaneidaclaims\">How Aerial Imagery Speeds Up Hurricane Ida Claims</h2>\n<p>The aftermath of any storm is when it’s most important for us to get in contact with our clients. They’ve just gone through the trauma of a hurricane, and now they have to deal with filing claims and repairing damage. The sooner they can get that process moving, the closer they are to getting back to normal.</p>\n<p>This is why we also send out a post-event wellness check text. That gives us a chance to check in and see how our policyholders are doing. Plus, 58 percent of these texts get a response. And if a customer indicates they’ve been evacuated, we can flag them for immediate post-storm review.</p>\n<p>Aerial imagery is a key component of this. Vendors provide the imagery, and we leverage internal and external insights to analyze the images. If we determine one of our policyholder’s has a damaged roof, we don’t have to wait for the roads to clear or internet service to come back online to get their claim started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/aerial-imagery.png\" alt=\"aerial imagery of houses after hurricane ida\" /></p>\n<p>By using these technologies, we’re able to get claims started and processed faster for our customers. That’s our number one goal: to help our customers when they need us most.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acommitmenttocustomersinachangingclimate\">A Commitment to Customers in a Changing Climate</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-and-home-insurance/\">climate is changing</a> and that means Hurricane Ida is probably not the last record-breaking storm that will affect our customers. Our focus on technology means we can handle their claims no matter what their new normal looks like.</p>"

      title: "Is home insurance tax deductible?"
      body: "<p>Let’s get straight to the point: you cannot deduct the premium you pay for your home insurance from your federal income tax returns.</p>\n<p>That can be frustrating, especially for new homeowners who may not have realized all of the additional costs that come with buying a home, like <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, repair bills, and property taxes. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Let’s take a closer look when home insurance is tax deductible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenishomeownersinsurancetaxdeductible\">When is homeowners insurance tax deductible?</h2>\n<p>Home insurance premiums usually aren’t tax deductible because most people buy homes for their personal use. But that means if your home is a business expense, then you may be able to deduct the cost of home insurance from your federal income tax.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may be able to deduct your homeowners insurance costs on your federal tax return if you bought the home as a rental property. A rental property is a business endeavor, so many of the expenses associated with maintaining the property are deductible. This typically includes homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>If you do have a rental property, make sure that you have the right type of home insurance. You want <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> and not a traditional homeowners policy. Sometimes called a rental dwelling policy, landlord insurance protects against the added risks that you face when you rent a property to others, including <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may be able to deduct a portion of your homeowners insurance payments if you run a business out of your home. The area you use as an office has to meet the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-small-business-owners-can-deduct-their-home-office-from-their-taxes\" text=\"criteria laid out by the Internal Revenue Service\" >}} (IRS) in order to qualify for a tax deduction. It must be</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Covered by your home insurance.</li>\n<li>Regularly and exclusively used for business purposes.</li>\n<li>Your business’ principal location.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"isprivatemortgageinsurancedeductible\">Is private mortgage insurance deductible?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">Private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) is a cost that you can deduct when filing your federal tax returns. It doesn’t matter if the property is your personal residence or a rental property – PMI is deductible in both cases.</p>\n<p>You should note that home insurance and PMI are two different things. The former protects you if your property is damaged. But PMI is coverage that protects your lender if you fail to make loan payments. Homeowners usually only have to get PMI if they can’t make a 20% down payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatareothernondeductiblehomeexpenses\">What are other non-deductible home expenses?</h2>\n<p>As you can see with homeowners insurance, not every expense associated with your home is deductible. Here are some common expenses most homeowners pay that aren’t deductible when it comes time to file your tax return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wages for housekeepers, gardeners, or other domestic workers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/hoa-fees/\">Homeowner associations fees</a> for a primary residence.</li>\n<li>Utility costs.</li>\n<li>Depreciation.</li>\n<li>Forfeited down payments or deposits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plan your budget to pay these necessary expenses, but don’t try to include them on your tax return’s itemized deduction list.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonhomeownersdeductions\">Common homeowners deductions</h2>\n<p>Home insurance may not be tax deductible, but there are still plenty of deductions that homeowners can look into. For example, you may want to talk to your tax preparer about the deductions available for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortgage interest.</strong> You can deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 of your mortgage debt for your primary home or a second home if you bought the house after December 16, 2017. For homes purchased between October 14, 1987 and December 15, 2017, the mortgage debt limit is $1 million.</li>\n<li><strong>Home equity loan interest.</strong> Interest on a home equity loan is typically deductible as long as you used the money to renovate your home. The amount of this loan counts towards the mortgage debt limit listed above.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical improvement expenses.</strong> Making upgrades for medical purposes, such as installing ramps or walk-in showers, may be deductible if you can show that someone in your household requires the accommodations.</li>\n<li><strong>Discount points.</strong> If you’ve purchased mortgage points, also called discount points, to reduce your mortgage interest, then you may be able to deduct the full amount from your federal taxes if you meet the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc504\" text=\"IRS criteria\" >}}. Note that discount points are not closing costs or loan origination points – those are not tax-deductible.</li>\n<li><strong>Property taxes.</strong> Those who are single or married and filing jointly can deduct up to $10,000 of property taxes. Those who are married filing separately can only deduct up to $5,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital gains.</strong> If you sell your home for a profit, you may owe capital gains taxes. However, married couples can claim up to $500,000 in capital gains exclusion and individuals can claim up to $250,000 if they lived in the house for at least two of the last five years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning about what is deductible and not deductible can help you better manage your home finances. While the homeowners insurance is not deductible, there are a lot of deductions that you can take advantage of to reduce the cost of home ownership.</p>"

      body: "<p>Folklore tells us that if March comes in like a lion, it goes out like a lamb. Unfortunately, March 2022 roared like a lion from beginning to end, with at least 210 confirmed tornadoes. That breaks the previous record of 192 in 2017.</p>\n<p>April probably won’t be much better. Experts predict anywhere from {{< external-link url=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/accuweather-2022-us-severe-weather-tornado-forecast/1151718\" text=\"200 to 275 tornadoes\" >}} next month and as many as 1,475 throughout the year. While record-breaking numbers like that are distressing, what may be even more unsettling is the change meteorologists have seen in both when and where tornadoes pop up. Historically, tornado season starts in March and lasts until June with states in Tornado Alley seeing the most activity. But scientists say the center of tornado activity actually appears to be {{< external-link url=\"https://www.purdue.edu/research/features/stories/center-of-u-s-tornado-activity-shifting-east-and-south-possibly-due-to-climate-change\" text=\"more towards the south and east\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Is Tornado Alley shifting because of climate change or have scientists gotten better at spotting twisters?

The term was first used in 1952 as a title for a research project that focused on Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska. As the term became more popular, the area it describes stretched to include states like Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Some add in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and even parts of eastern Colorado.</p>\n<p>Tornado Alley has a high risk for twisters because the area has flat, dry terrain that is often a meeting point for warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains. When these two types of air masses collide, the warm air rises and the cool air sinks. The result is severe thunderstorms with rotating winds, known as supercells. A funnel cloud may form if the winds in a supercell move at different speeds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isthereanewtornadoalley\">Is There a New Tornado Alley?</h2>\n<p>The data apparently supports the claims that Tornado Alley is shifting from its traditional location. For example, one {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2\" text=\"recent study\" >}} showed tornado frequency has increased in the Midwest and Southeast over the last four decades. Information compiled by USA Today also found that {{< external-link url=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/06/17/how-expansion-tornado-alley-affect-more-southern-states/7689547002\" text=\"20 states experienced increased tornado activity\" >}} between the years 2000 and 2019 compared with 1980 and 1990.</p>\n<p>Many states outside of the traditional Tornado Alley boundaries saw a significant increase in tornado activity, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alabama, up 303 tornadoes.</li>\n<li>Mississippi, up 286 tornadoes.</li>\n<li>Kentucky, up 205 tornadoes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experts also think that tornado season also may be expanding. Tornado season unofficially starts in March and runs through June. However, the data compiled by USA Today show that recent years have seen more tornado swarms ﹘ outbreaks of 10 or more tornadoes from a single storm system ﹘ popping up both earlier and later in the season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"istornadoalleyshiftingbecauseofclimatechange\">Is Tornado Alley Shifting Because of Climate Change?</h2>\n<p>The jury is still out on whether the shift in tornado activity is due to climate change or not. Experts generally agree that there are more twisters in the southeastern states, but they {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/tornadoes-and-climate-change\" text=\"cannot directly link this to climate change\" >}}. Several studies have found that warming temperatures make the conditions that lead to severe thunderstorms more likely.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we may be seeing more tornadoes because of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better radar technology.</strong> Scientists can now identify storms that may produce tornadoes.</li>\n<li><strong>Population growth.</strong> More people in areas impacted by tornadoes means more eyewitness reports.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More research needs to be done to determine if there’s a direct link between tornadoes and climate change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreparefortornadoes\">How to Prepare for Tornadoes</h2>\n<p>Tornado Alley shifting towards the southeast puts more people at risk, but you can take steps to keep everyone safe. The first step is figuring out how likely tornadoes are in your area. You can do this with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s {{< external-link url=\"https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map\" text=\"National Risk Index\" >}}, an online tool that calculates your county’s risk for 18 natural hazards, including tornadoes.</p>\n<p>Next you need to learn the signs that a tornado is on the way. For example, you want to be on the lookout for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A greenish or dark sky.</li>\n<li>Large hail.</li>\n<li>A wall cloud, or a cloud that suddenly forms beneath the base of a cumulonimbus cloud.</li>\n<li>A funnel cloud, or a rotating column of condensed water droplets.</li>\n<li>A loud roar that sounds like a freight train.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note, however, that tornadoes aren’t always visible. They can be blocked by hills, trees, buildings, and even rain. That’s why it’s also important to pay attention to your local weather report and stay inside if the conditions are right for a tornado. Your community may also have an advanced emergency warning system. If you hear the siren, look for shelter.</p>\n<p>These and other <a href=\"/blog/tornado-safety-tips/\">tornado safety tips</a> can help you avoid harm if a tornado hits your area, but part of your preparation should also be a review of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most policies cover damage caused by wind storms like tornadoes, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to double check.</p>"

      title: "Is Your Homeowners Policy Ready for Summer?"
      body: "<p>It's all fun and games until someone over-fuels the fire pit. Here's how insurance may respond to your favorite summer activities when they go awry.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summerhomeownersinsuranceandyou\">Summer, Homeowners Insurance, and You</h2>\n<p>Ah, summer. Longer days, better weather, and maybe even a little vacation time. You’re almost certainly ready (we sure are!), but is your homeowners insurance policy? For example, do you know whether your homeowners policy will protect you if you build a fire pit in your backyard?</p>\n<p>Now is the time to find out. See how summer’s most popular events will affect your homeowners policy and what steps you should take (if any) to make sure you’re covered through the dog days and beyond.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swimming pools</strong>: If you already have a pool, you’ve likely already purchased a homeowners policy that offers coverage for any <a href=\"/blog/is-my-pool-covered-under-my-homeowners-policy/\">pool-related liabilities</a> and property damage. But if you’re installing one this summer (in ground or above), make sure you let your insurance carrier know. Swimming pools introduce a whole new world of risk for you and your guests, so your insurance company will likely want to update your policy to accommodate the new structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Trampolines</strong>: Summer days spent jumping in the sun (or shade, depending on the weather) can make for great fun and great memories. But like swimming pools, trampolines come with unique risks. If you buy a trampoline this summer, call your insurance company. As with the swimming pool, they may have to update your policy to ensure that you’re covered in case something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Grills, barbecues, and fire pits</strong>: Whether you’re enjoying a small family meal or hosting a neighborhood blowout, outdoor cooking appliances come with a unique set of dangers. While most grills and grilling activity is covered by a standard homeowners policy, fire pits and freestanding barbecue structures may not be. The key is to check local laws and ordinances around fires. In fire-prone areas of the country, recreational burning is often banned or heavily restricted. In other areas, municipalities may require you to place or build fire pits a certain distance from your home or your neighbors’ property lines. Homeowners insurance policies won’t cover damage from illegal activities, so if fires are off-limits where you live, avoid them or risk losing coverage through your policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Home repairs</strong>: Summer is a great time to have external repairs and upgrades done to your property. But before you jump into a new project, make sure you’ve got adequate insurance protection. If you’re hiring contractors, verify their workers’ compensation and general liability insurance before they start work. Talk with your insurance provider to determine whether your existing <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">property coverage</a> will still function normally while work is being done on your home (coverage varies by policy). In some cases, you may want to take out a builder’s risk policy (or ask to be named as an additional insured on your contractor’s policy), which covers equipment, tools, and materials for building projects in progress. For minor updates like new shutters or paint, check that whoever does the work has active general liability and workers’ comp coverage. That way, if anything goes wrong, you’ll be able to collect financial compensation to cover your losses.</li>\n<li><strong>Traveling</strong>: For one- or two-week vacations, your standard homeowners insurance policy covers you. But if you’re planning to be gone for more than 30 or 60 days (depending on your policy), you may be required to carry vacant home insurance on top of your normal homeowners policy. This is because a vacant house is more susceptible to certain risks (theft, vandalism, etc.) and insurance companies want to make sure they’re calculating the risk properly. If you don’t feel like getting more insurance (trust us, we don’t blame you), consider hiring a homesitter you can trust to maintain your property for the duration of your trip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s plenty to love about the warmest season of the year. But before you transition to full “living is easy” mode, verify that your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> is ready to protect you no matter how you plan to enjoy the season.</p>"

      title: "Kin Customer Savings Survey: Q2 2021 Results"
      body: "<p>If you live in Florida or Louisiana, you already know that finding affordable home insurance used to be a chore. These are the two <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">top-priced home insurance markets</a> in the country with annual premiums averaging $1,951 and $1,968, respectively. Unfortunately, more severe storms and <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">rising materials costs</a> mean insurance premiums will continue to climb in the near term.</p>\n<p>Making homeowners insurance affordable is one of our primary goals, so we regularly survey our customers to see how we're doing. Here's what our Q2 survey revealed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdocustomerssaveonaveragewithkin\">How Much Do Customers Save on Average with Kin?</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey/\">survey last year</a> showed customers save approximately $600 on average when they switch to Kin. Take a look at the savings based on the type of policy that new Kin customers purchased. That’s a substantial amount of savings, especially when you consider that most of our customers are in high-risk zones for natural disasters.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagekincustomersavingsbypolicy\">Average Kin Customer Savings by Policy</h3>\n<p>| Policy Type | Average Savings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Homeowners | $616 |\n| Condominium | $438 |\n| Mobile Home | $620 |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p>Kin customers who own condominiums don’t save quite as much as home and mobile homeowners do. That’s because <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> is generally much cheaper than the other products because it doesn't usually cover the building's exterior –&nbsp;typically, the HOA is responsible for insuring that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdofloridahomeownerssaveonaveragewithkin\">How Much Do Florida Homeowners Save on Average with Kin?</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at Florida. The most recent data puts the average annual home insurance premium in the Sunshine State at $1,951. Kin homeowners insurance customers report an average savings of $676.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagekinfloridacustomersavingsbypolicy\">Average Kin Florida Customer Savings by Policy</h3>\n<p>| Policy Type | Average Savings |\n| --- | --- |\n| Homeowners | $676 |\n| Condo | $429 |\n| Rental Dwelling | $562 |\n| Mobile Home | $597 |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p>We’ve only been <a href=\"/blog/hi-louisiana/\">writing policies in Louisiana since</a> March 2021, so we didn’t have a large enough data pool to provide detailed information about savings. That said, our Louisiana customers report savings of $698 per year on homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownerschoosekin\">Why Do Homeowners Choose Kin?</h2>\n<p>We also wanted to find out if price is the only reason people made the move to Kin. Otherwise, how can we know if we’re providing the best insurance experience possible? So we asked customers to rank their reasons for choosing Kin between four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better price.</li>\n<li>Better customer service.</li>\n<li>Ease of use.</li>\n<li>Other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More than 60 percent of new customers came because we offered a better price. Another 16 percent came for improved customer service, and eight percent chose us for our ease of use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/why-kin.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This is the second year that our Customer Savings Survey showed that better prices drew most new customers our way. But it is the first time that cost far outstripped both better customer service and ease of use﹘although together, those accounted for nearly a quarter of are new customers. Ultimately, these responses indicated that we’re offering a simple process with exceptional service all for the best possible price.</p>\n<p>How do we achieve this? We’ve cut out extra costs like independent agents and brick-and-mortar locations. By completely digitizing the product and process, we’ve been able to make a better experience that saves customers money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wouldhomeownersrecommendkintoafriend\">Would Homeowners Recommend Kin to a Friend?</h2>\n<p>The better experience customers get with Kin is also evident in our Net Promoter Score (NPS). It’s a metric that looks at a company’s customer experience and is useful in predicting business growth. Essentially, the NPS says whether customers will recommend a service to a friend.</p>\n<p>The average NPS in the insurance industry is 42, and most of our direct competitors’ NPS is in the 40s and 50s. Our NPS is 85, nearly 10 points higher than the next best, USAA. This tells us that our customers are big fans who are ready and willing to share their positive experience with friends and family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"netpromoterscoresforhomeownersinsurancecompanies\">Net Promoter Scores for Homeowners Insurance Companies</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/2021-nps.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thetakeaway\">The Takeaway</h2>\n<p>As you can probably tell, we’re excited about our survey results. They mean we’re fulfilling our promises and that is important to us. But it’s probably even more important to note that people who may otherwise struggle to find home insurance are getting coverage that makes homeownership possible.</p>\n<p>If you want to see what real customers have to say about us, check out the more than <a href=\"/reviews/\">1,700 reviews on Trustpilot</a>. You can see for yourself why we have an 89 percent five-star rating and read exactly what customers are talking about.</p>"

      body: "<p>“What do our members need?”</p>\n<p>We ask ourselves that question a lot around the Kin offices, whether we’re helping homeowners understand their coverage or building a system to deliver quick insurance quotes. The question is important to us because the answers inform just about every decision we make. Putting customers first is just what we do.</p>\n<p>Our member-centric approach matters most when things are at their worst – and it doesn’t get much worse than the day you have a hurricane barreling down on your home.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we had been asking ourselves about our customers' needs long before Hurricanes Ian and Nicole hit the Sunshine State. Our answers let us put together a game plan to help members before, during, and after the storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kinscatastropheresponse\">Kin’s catastrophe response</h2>\n<p>But Kin is also made up of people – our Kinfolk! – who care deeply about our members, especially when those members are facing a catastrophe. So between thinking about what our customers’ needs and having the technology to meet them, we came up with a strategy to keep homeowners safe. It included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overlaying real-time weather updates from the National Hurricane Center on our policies to identify which homes were in the storm’s path.</li>\n<li>Alerting members who may have been impacted by the storm three days before landfall so they could gather supplies and secure their homes.</li>\n<li>Checking in on members after the hurricane to see if they were okay and if they needed to file a claim.</li>\n<li>Using aerial imagery to scan <strong>40,000 properties</strong> for damage to jumpstart the claims process and tell members who had been evacuated about the condition of their homes.</li>\n<li>Mobilizing a cross-company effort to contact members who filed claims, allowing us to check in on their well-being and get the claims process started as efficiently as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a good thing we had a plan in place, too. In just one week, we were hit with as many claims as we had for the entire preceding year. Despite the overwhelming number of claims, our team ended up beating the industry averages. The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floir.com/home/ian\" text=\"Florida Office of Insurance Regulation\" >}} says we have a higher claims closure rate (78%) and a lower claims open without payment rate (10.2%) compared to our competitors.</p>\n<p>We’re proud of the work we did during the 2022 hurricane season. None of it was easy, but we truly feel that we made a difference for many of our members, or at least the 7,944 who filed claims so far – an increase of nearly <a href=\"/news/kin-insurance-provides-hurricane-ian-update/\">17% from our prior update</a>.</p>\n<p>Making sure our members have the money they need to rebuild is a big part of our catastrophe response, but it isn’t the only way we helped them. After Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, several of our Kinfolk also put in long days staffing Florida’s <a href=\"/hurricane-ian-assistance/\">insurance village</a> to assist customers who had lost internet or phone service. Whether these employees spent that time helping a homeowner navigate a claim, issuing a check for <a href=\"/blog/additional-living-expenses-examples/\">additional living expenses</a>, answering questions about the claims process, or simply sitting by someone's side and listening to their story, they showed that our highest priority is taking care of our members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ourmembersaretalking\">Our members are talking</h2>\n<p>What really makes our efforts worthwhile, however, is hearing how our members feel about their experience with Kin. This was especially true in the days following Hurricane Ian.</p>\n<p>Many of our representatives were working long hours trying to contact members who had initiated claims. You can imagine how tired and stressed out our members were in that situation, so hearing positive comments from them meant the world to our team. Many of our homeowners told us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They never had an insurance company care until now.</li>\n<li>Our team members are prompt, professional, and kind.</li>\n<li>They appreciated Kin checking in on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can take a look at more of our <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> to get a better idea of the kind of feedback we’ve earned over the years.</p>\n<p>We get it, finding affordable homeowners insurance is incredibly tough right now, and storms like Ian and Nicole only exacerbate the problems that push <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida home insurance rates skyward.</a> But we're doing everything we can to provide members with affordable coverage and, when disaster strikes, marshaling all our strength to support people in their time of need.</p>\n<p>Like we always say, we’re a different kind of insurance company. So we’re going to keep looking for ways to improve by putting you, our members, first.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2022.</em></p>"

      title: "Lessons from 1800-1900 Insurance Policies"
      body: "<p>You can learn a lot from the past. What can you learn from how insurance used to be?</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.” -James Baldwin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s always fun to take a stroll down memory lane, whether it’s looking at old childhood photos, going to a local museum or reading a good historical novel. History indeed reveals the past but can often be a predicator of the future. The best part about history is the continual discovery of hidden gems; much can be learned from seemingly innocuous things that implode with fascination upon exploration.</p>\n<p>Take homeowners insurance for instance. What could possibly be fun and enlightening about paying for something you may never actually use that requires an arduous application and claims process due to outdated systemic protocols? Well, the truth is, the insurance industry wasn’t always stigmatized as malevolent and filled with corporate greed. In fact, the concept of homeowners insurance transpired out of the Great London Fire in 1666. This unprecedented blaze destroyed over 13,000 homes, and it’s estimated over 70,000 of London’s then 80,000 homes endured damage as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/dwelling-insurance.jpg?width=2221&name=dwelling-insurance.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In such, fire insurance was born and essentially paved the way to <a href=\"/blog/the-history-of-homeowners-insurance-in-america/\">present day homeowners insurance</a>. Fires were rather common because wood was the primary material to build homes and people used gasoline stoves and candles to make light. This equaled an inevitable recipe for disaster. Our ancestors’ started off by isolating just one peril, fire, and then slowly began to offer various other forms of insurance protection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/insurance-from-1800s-gas-stove-permit.jpg?width=2448&name=insurance-from-1800s-gas-stove-permit.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1732, fire insurance was introduced to the United States but didn’t really garner popularity until the next century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatdidatypicalpolicylooklikeinthe1800s\">What did a typical policy look like in the 1800's?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/insurance-policy-from-1800s.jpg?width=2448&name=insurance-policy-from-1800s.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Actual insurance policy from 1849 with $500 worth of fire coverage for a $40 premium with a policy duration of 5 years.</p>\n<p>For $5 in 1849 an individual could get a $500 fire policy. Prices in 2017 are 2985.4% higher than prices in 1849, so $5 is equivalent to $154.27 and $500 is equivalent to $15,426.78. That doesn't sound too bad at first glance, however, many insurance companies at the time did not insure up to the full cash value and only offered a percentage of the value of the property. This was only for the structure of the home as well. Again, as history progressed, more and more types of policies were added on such as for furniture (which predates today's personal property coverage), gas stove permits, electric light permits, lightning, and marine coverage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/insurance-policy-from-the-1800s.jpg?width=1631&name=insurance-policy-from-the-1800s.jpg\" alt=\"\" />This is an actual handwritten insurance policy from 1849</p>\n<p>To give a little context, the average worker in the mid 1800’s earned about $1-$2 a day. Work back then was very different than today; folks didn’t go to the same place, punch in and work 40hrs a week. Things were very sporadic and unpredictable. In such, the average person earned $10-$20 a month. In 2017 standards, that’s about $30-$60 a day or $595-$620 a month. Back then folks were paying about a week or two’s worth of salary on fire insurance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/blog/laborers-1800s_153899975.jpg?width=2400&name=laborers-1800s_153899975.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In 2017, the average cost of a homeowner’s insurance policy nationally was $1,082. The average income for a single person according to the most recent US Census data in 2014 was $34,940. Since women did not work in the 1800’s the fairest comparison is with a single today. So essentially, the same applies over 150 years later, a homeowner’s insurance premium is still about 1-2 week’s salary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sowhatdidahousecostinthe1800s\">So what did a house cost in the 1800s?</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/teachers/lessonplans/1870CatalogueofGoods.pdf\">National Park Service</a>, in 1870 land cost $5/acre (avg. 160 acres) a 4 ROOM house was 32’x40’ and cost $700, a TWO room house was 16'x22' and cost $300, and a shanty 8'x10' (1room/dirt floor) was $25. Remember, a $5 premium could garner $500 worth of fire coverage but didn't necessarily cover the full replacement. The most challenging thing plaguing consumers at the time was the claims process. The industry was essentially self regulating with very little governmental intervention. Folks were getting scammed and so were the insurance agencies. Arson was a very big problem as everyone was looking for a payout. Many insurance companies were not able to pay out claims as they had inadequate funds, just like a present day Ponzi scheme.</p>\n<p>The main take away from looking back upon the history books is to see how society has evolved and get an understanding of the complexities and unpleasantries of the homeowners insurance industry in general. Many people were severely burned durning that time by unscrupulous practices paving the way for increased governmental oversight on both the federal and state levels. Consumer protectionism, customized policies, and comprehensive polices were nonexistent at the time.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies have historically had immense leverage in society and perceived as a necessary evil. Without homeowners insurance all the homes effected by <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a>, earthquakes, fires and any other devastating act would remain in ruins, cities would be destroyed, states and countries would be a lot worse off.</p>"

Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianasbiggesthurricanes\">Louisiana’s Biggest Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>Louisiana’s biggest and most devastating hurricane in recent years was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm caused more than $125 billion in damages and claimed the lives of more than 1,570 Louisiana residents. Entire urban communities were submerged in more than 10 feet of water. New Orleans still hasn’t fully recovered. The storm displaced more than 1 million people at its peak. Recent estimates say {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/hurricane-katrina\" text=\"more than 400,000 people have been permanently displaced\" >}} by the storm. Hurricane Katrina’s legacy is still felt throughout the state.</p>\n<p>Not every storm hits Louisiana with the same intensity, though seven hurricanes in recent history have reached a similar windspeed. Take a look at the chart below.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<p>| Storm Name | Year | Max Windspeed |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Audrey | 1957 | 177 mph |\n| Betsy | 1965 | 130 mph |\n| Camille | 1969 | 190 mph |\n| Andrew | 1992 | 141 mph |\n| Katrina | 2005 | 175 mph |\n| Rita | 2005 | 175 mph |\n| Ike | 2008 | 110 mph |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianascostliesthurricanes\">Louisiana’s Costliest Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>The damage a hurricane can cause is twofold. First, the intense wind speeds can cause damage on their own, blowing debris at such velocity that they act as projectiles. Wind can be strong enough to rip roofs off homes, blow down trees, break windows, upend cars, and more. Second, heavy rains and storm surges almost always accompany hurricanes. As we touched on with Katrina, that amount of rain and flooding can submerge entire communities.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to fortify your Louisiana home. <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Strong roofs</a>, <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a>, and adequate <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> can make a world of difference when you need to recover from a major storm.</p>\n<p>These are the hurricanes that have caused the most damage in Louisiana to date.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/louisiana-costliest-hurricanes.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<p>| Storm | Cost of Damages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Betsy | $1.42 billion |\n| Camille | $1.42 billion |\n| Andrew | $25 billion |\n| Katrina | $125 billion |\n| Rita | $10.5 billion |\n| Ike | $34.8 billion |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<h2 id=\"costliesthurricaneinushistoryhurricanekatrina\">Costliest Hurricane in US History: Hurricane Katrina</h2>\n<p>Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005.

People fled by foot on freeway overpasses or made their way to rooftops to await rescue. Many who fled hard-hit areas like New Orleans have yet to return.</p>\n<p>Because many areas around New Orleans were not classified as FEMA flood zones, many residents were not required to have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. The levee, which failed during the storm, also gave a false sense of security for the community.</p>\n<p>In fact, even after Katrina, nearly {{< external-link url=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/fourteen-years-later-new-orleans-is-still-trying-to-recover-from-hurricane-katrina\" text=\"53 percent\" >}} of the city’s properties are still classified as non-risk flood zones even though these exact areas saw nearly 12 feet of floodwater during the storm.</p>\n<p>It’s a good reminder that flood insurance is a necessary safeguard, especially in Louisiana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoeslouisianaexperiencesomanyhurricanes\">Why Does Louisiana Experience So Many Hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Louisiana’s position along the Gulf of Mexico makes the state especially susceptible to hurricanes. The Gulf is ideal for the formation of hurricanes each year because of its warm water and its location. Hurricanes in the northern hemisphere form at tropical and subtropical regions and move toward the East Coast. The Gulf’s warm water creates the perfect conditions for hurricanes to form. The water must be at least {{< external-link url=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-hurricanes-hit-the-east-coast-of-the-u-s-but-never-the-west-coast/\" text=\"80 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain a hurricane\" >}}, and the Gulf is regularly 83 degrees in summer months.</p>\n<p>The {{< external-link url=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/storms/how-hurricanes-form\" text=\"hurricane is formed\" >}} as warm moisture rises above the water and cools at higher altitudes in zones of low pressure. This starts the formation of clouds which will begin to rotate in alignment with the Earth’s rotation to create an organized pressure system. With more warm water, the storm clouds and speeds grow. Wind speeds need to reach at least 74 miles per hour for the system to become a hurricane.</p>\n<p>For Louisiana, hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30 each year. At least {{< external-link url=\"https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/07/29/breakdown-why-more-hurricanes-form-gulf-coast-august/\" text=\"three named storms\" >}} happen in August alone each year. Both Hurricane Andrew and Katrina were August storms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"climatechangeandthefutureoflouisianahurricanes\">Climate Change and the Future of Louisiana Hurricanes</h2>\n<p>The entire planet is feeling the <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">effects of climate change</a> and global warming, and Louisiana is no exception. The state is warmer and rising waters threaten low-lying properties with flooding. Soil is drier, but there’s an increase in annual rainfall, most of which happens in heavy downpours. Tropical storms and hurricanes are becoming more frequent and more intense.</p>\n<p>Higher sea levels is a major concern. Grand Isle, Louisiana, measured one of the three highest rates of sea-level rise in 2019. The area rose 7.93 millimeters for the year, higher than both Rockport and Galveston where the other notable levels were recorded. At this rate, the water levels in the area could be {{< external-link url=\"https://texasclimatenews.org/tcn-journal/new-study-confirms-gulf-coast-sea-level-rise-among-the-countrys-highest/\" text=\"1.77 feet higher by 2050\" >}}.</p>\n<p>The water is getting warmer, too. Seawater is holding more heat from greenhouse gases. During summer months, the Grand Isle water temperature averages 83 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. But climate data suggests that water is heating up at an average rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Water farther offshore where drilling occurs measured temperatures {{< external-link url=\"https://time.com/5824299/ocean-temperature-rise-climate-change/\" text=\"1.7 degrees Fahrenheit higher\" >}} than normal in 2020.</p>\n<p>This means more warm water to fuel intense hurricanes.</p>\n<p>In other words, Louisiana residents need to be more prepared for the next storm because the risk of damage and flooding grows by the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learningfromlouisianashurricanehistory\">Learning from Louisiana’s Hurricane History</h2>\n<p>The hurricanes of the past can help us predict and brace for worse storms in the future. That means fortifying your home for hurricane and <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">flood risks</a> and making sure your insurance can protect you.</p>\n<p>Take a lesson from Katrina: even if you’re not in a high-risk flood zone, your area can still flood. Don’t take a chance on your life’s biggest investment. Learn about the flood protection with rates as low as $175 per year.</p>"

Your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimate</a>, the amount needed to rebuild your home from the bottom up, is based on construction and lumber costs.

For example, lumber prices in April 2016 hovered around $300 per thousand board feet. They steadily climbed through 2018, reaching nearly $500, dipped again in 2019, and have been climbing rapidly from 2020 through today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/lumber-prices-chart.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><i>Source: Business Insider, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price\">Markets</a>, April 21, 2021.</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"whyislumbersoexpensive\">Why Is Lumber So Expensive?</h3>\n<p>The rise in lumber prices is a result of a perfect storm that started with increased demand due to storm damage in states like Florida and Louisiana. Next came the pandemic that slowed lumber production just when everyone was staying home and starting home improvement projects. All the while, historically low mortgage rates spawned new home builds.</p>\n<p>Basically, everything that could put a demand on an industry happened in the course of a year.</p>\n<p>Sabrina Beaumont of the home-building platform {{< external-link url=\"https://passionplans.com/\" text=\"Passion Plans\" >}} says the extremely limited supply of wood has made it difficult for her business: “We're experiencing major delays in building projects. A lot of the contractors we work with say that they can barely build new construction profitably right now.”</p>\n<p>This is a further sign that lumber companies can’t cover their commitments. That and the upcoming hurricane season has experts predicting lumber prices will continue to rise for the rest of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constructioncostsinflationandhomeinsurancerates\">Construction Costs, Inflation, and Home Insurance Rates</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> found in every home policy is driven by the replacement cost estimate – essentially, what it costs to build a new home similar to your old home. Construction costs, both in terms of labor and materials, impact this estimate, so insurance rates go up when construction costs do. Inflation rates can help illustrate this relationship.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"nationalaveragehomeownersinsurancepremiumchangevsinflationrate\">National Average Homeowners Insurance Premium Change Vs.

One interesting point to note is the sudden surge in home insurance premiums and inflation in 2018. Lumber prices soared then, too, increasing 30 percent from August 2017 to January 2018 – right after Hurricane Harvey.</p>\n<p>Anything that increases demand for a good, in this case lumber, can cause inflation. The same is true if there’s a disruption in the supply chain, like a pandemic that keeps people from working. And there you have it again: the perfect storm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howstatesareaffectedbyreconstructioncosts\">How States Are Affected by Reconstruction Costs</h2>\n<p>Every state is affected differently by the cost of reconstruction. Those hit hardest tend to be areas where transporting goods is difficult and where natural disasters have forced a significant increase in the demand for reconstruction.</p>\n<p>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.verisk.com/siteassets/media/underwriting-v/resources/360value-quarterly/360value-q2-2021-usa-report.pdf\" text=\"According to Verisk 360Value Quarterly Cost Update\" >}} [PDF], Idaho, Hawaii, and New Mexico saw the greatest increase in reconstruction costs in Q2: 11.93, 11.06, and 10.1 percent, respectively. The stress on the construction industry created by the pandemic is exacerbated in all these states by their geography.</p>\n<p>States like Louisiana and Florida are good examples of how storm damage can lead to an increased demand for home repairs. The same can be said for California, where wildfires have also caused serious home damage and loss throughout the state. All the losses result in a higher demand for reconstruction and materials needed to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies have no choice but to consider the cost to rebuild a home when it prices homeowners insurance. While something like lumber costs is just one component of the replacement cost estimate, it is a major one that affects every insured home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownerscanexpectfromrisingconstructioncosts\">What Homeowners Can Expect from Rising Construction Costs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">Homeowners insurance costs</a> are on the rise because lumber costs have driven up replacement cost estimates. How much of an increase you can expect remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>Remember that replacement cost estimate is only one <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">factor insurers use to calculate your premium</a>. Many homeowners are also seeing rate increases because of their claims history, severe natural disaster exposure, and other factors.</p>\n<p>With so many variables, it’s important to control the ones you can, so make sure that your home’s replacement cost estimate is accurate. Talk to your insurance provider and review the details of how the estimate was made.</p>\n<p>Check that any recent upgrades, like hardwood floors and high-end cabinetry, are included so your coverage adequately reflects what it would cost to rebuild. This may increase the replacement cost, but it’s better to have the right amount of coverage than to be one of the <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">64 percent of homeowners who are underinsured</a>.</p>"

      body: "<p>The human impact on the environment is growing and requires our attention immediately, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC’s <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM\">latest climate change report</a>, released on August 9, shows that climate change is “widespread, rapid, and intensifying.”</p>\n<p>However, the prognosis is not entirely grim. The IPCC report says we may be able to curb the effects of climate change if we can reduce greenhouse gases over the next decade.</p>\n<p>The report, which the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called \"a code red for humanity,\" comes in a year where we’ve already seen record-breaking and life-threatening temperatures, wildfires, and floods. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death Valley hit an average daily temperature of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/death-valley-records-hottest-average-temperature-over-24-hours-180978162/#\">118.1 degrees Fahrenheit</a> on July 11 and the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth, 130 degrees Fahrenheit on July 9.</li>\n<li>California’s <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/4jandlhh/top20_acres.pdf\">Dixie Fire</a>, the state’s second largest wildfire ever, started on July 13 and has burned over half a million acres. As of this writing, it continues to burn.</li>\n<li>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects up to 20 named storms for the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season\">2021 Atlantic hurricane season</a> with up to 10 of those becoming significant hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the IPCC, human-induced climate change is the driving force behind these higher temperatures and more severe hurricanes as well as the drought conditions that increase the likelihood of wildfire. And these extreme weather events do more than <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">impact homeowners insurance rates</a>. They are likely to affect everything from our food supply to our healthcare system. Most importantly, more people will find themselves in harm’s way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keyfindingsoftheipccclimatechangereport\">Key Findings of the IPCC Climate Change Report</h2>\n<p>The IPCC looked at the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere (or the frozen areas) for key indicators of climate change and our impact on it. Many of its key findings reveal changes to the earth’s climate accelerating at a rate that outstrips previous eras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Greenhouse gas levels:</strong> We have not seen atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations this high in the past 2 million years. Methane (CH4), which is much more effective at trapping heat, is at its highest levels in 800,000 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Rising temperatures:</strong> The past 50 years have warmed faster than any period of the past 2,000 years. The IPCC predicts global temperatures will continue to rise, increasing heat waves and causing longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons.</li>\n<li><strong>Melting ice:</strong> The earth’s increased surface temperature is causing more ice melt in the Arctic sea. In fact, the ice coverage in the Arctic is less than it has been for the past 1,000 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Rising sea levels:</strong> As ice melts, sea levels rise, and the current levels are the highest they’ve been in 3,000 years. And the rate the seas are rising is increasing significantly. Between 1901 and 1971, sea levels rose 1.3mm per year. Compare that to the 3.7mm per year they rose between 2006 and 2018.</li>\n<li><strong>Ocean acidification:</strong> Carbon dioxide adversely affects more than just land life. As it dissolves in seawater, CO2 causes oceans to become more acidic which damages sea life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"climatechangereportsayshumansaretoblame\">Climate Change Report Says Humans Are to Blame</h2>\n<p>The key findings above squash any notion that climate change isn’t happening. But the most important takeaway from the climate change report is the argument that human-caused greenhouse gases are the reason for our climate woes.</p>\n<p>The two biggest problems are our reliance on fossil fuels and deforestation. Burning fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal is how most American get their energy, producing heat and electricity and powering cars. But it also produces carbon dioxide which is the greenhouse gas that’s the primary reason earth’s temperatures are rising.</p>\n<p>Forests are supposed to filter out CO2 from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/#\">10 million hectares</a> of forest per year were taken down between 2015 and 2020. While this is down from 16 million hectares each year in the 90s, the number is still alarming. More importantly, the reduction in forests means there are fewer filters in the world to pull CO2 emissions out of the air and release oxygen back into the atmosphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stabilizingtheclimate\">Stabilizing the Climate</h2>\n<p>According to the IPCC climate change report, we can take steps to stabilize the environment. Specifically, the authors mention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapidly reducing methane emissions.</li>\n<li>Limiting cumulative carbon emissions.</li>\n<li>Reducing other greenhouse gases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2015 Paris climate agreement sought to achieve many of these things and to keep global warming under 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Currently, most of the world’s major economies are falling behind in their efforts. However, if dramatic changes can be made, we can limit greenhouse gas emissions and limit the effects of global warming. If that happens, the IPCC postulates that earth’s climate could start to cool in a few decades.</p>\n<p>Humans have to understand that without hard work and a change in our mentality the ramifications of climate change will be with us through this century – or longer.</p>"

      title: "Mortgage refinancing options explained"
      body: "<p>If you’ve never refinanced your mortgage before, it can feel like a steep learning curve. How do you know which refinancing option is right for you?</p>\n<p>Refinancing simply means you take an existing <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a> and replace it with a new mortgage for the same property. You aren’t moving, just changing the terms of your loan while you continue living in your home.</p>\n<p>Refinancing makes sense when you want to reduce your interest rate, get rid of private mortgage insurance, lower your monthly payments, or extend your term. Let’s take a look at some common refinancing options and when you might consider them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raterefinance\">Rate refinance</h2>\n<p>The rate refinance is one of the most straightforward refinancing options. In this refinance, you take your old loan and swap it out for a new loan with a lower interest rate. By lowering the interest rate, you’ll save on your monthly mortgage payments and pay less interest over the course of the loan. Ultimately, this refinance is done to save money in both the short and long term.</p>\n<p>Consider a rate refinance if interest rates have gone down significantly since you closed on your existing mortgage. You want the savings to be enough to offset the closing costs associated with the new mortgage. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/refinance/when-and-when-not-to-refinance-mortgage/\">Most experts agree that if you can save at least one percent</a> (better if it’s at least two percent) on your interest rate, it makes sense to refinance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"termrefinance\">Term refinance</h2>\n<p>While all refinances adjust the terms of your loan, a term refinance is done specifically to change how long it will take to repay the loan. When you do a term refinance, you are trying to achieve one of two things: extend the loan length or shorten it.</p>\n<p>You might want to extend the loan length if you can dramatically reduce your monthly payments by taking longer to pay the loan. Conversely, if you are trying to pay off a mortgage faster, you can often get a better rate for changing from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Consider a term refinance that lengthens the loan only if absolutely necessary. You’ll be adding closing costs to the loan (or paying them out of pocket), making refinancing potentially expensive. This might be a good option if your income has decreased and is expected to stay that way for a while. It’s better to extend the term of the mortgage than be overextended on your monthly payments.</p>\n<p>Consider a term refinance that shortens your loan if you are looking to pay more each month to pay off your home sooner. By converting from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, you’ll pay more each month and potentially be debt-free faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaloanrefinance\">FHA loan refinance</h2>\n<p>There are two FHA mortgage refinance meanings. The first option takes an FHA loan – a loan backed by the Federal Housing Authority – and rolls it along with the associated loan fees into a new FHA loan. This is no different than any other mortgage refinance.</p>\n<p>The other option is a <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/removing-private-mortgage-insurance/\">PMI-canceling refinance</a>. This type of FHA loan refinance allows you to take an FHA mortgage that has enough equity in the property and refinance it into a conventional loan to get rid of the costly private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI can be as much as 2.25 percent of the original loan amount per year, so it’s pretty expensive to have tacked on to your payments. FHA loans that don’t have at least 20 percent equity in the property are required to pay PMI to insure the loan against default.</p>\n<p>Consider an FHA loan refinance to cancel out PMI as soon as it’s feasible to do so. This means you need to have been in the home for at least two years and built up enough equity (by payment or appreciation) to meet lender requirements. Be sure to talk to your lender to see if there are other guidelines you must meet to be eligible for an FHA refinance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cashoutrefinance\">Cash-out refinance</h2>\n<p>A cash-out refinance takes an existing mortgage and refinances it while adding into the new loan some of the equity built up in the home. For example, if your home was valued at $350,000 and you had a $200,000 mortgage, you could do a cash-out refinance of $300,000 and take $100,000 in cash when the loan closes to use for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>Folks often do a cash-out refinance to get funds to update, remodel, or renovate their homes. They can also use it to pay for kids’ college education or to consolidate other debts. Many people consolidate <a href=\"/blog/tricks-to-paying-off-credit-cards/\">expensive credit card debt</a> into their mortgage through a cash-out refinance, paying off the credit cards to then make higher monthly mortgage payments at a better rate.</p>\n<p>Consider a cash-out refinance if you don’t have another way to fund your need. Remember that you’re adding that extra cash to a 15- or 30-year mortgage, so you’ll be paying interest on it for years to come. When consolidating debt, make sure you <a href=\"/blog/best-budgeting-apps/\">change your spending habits</a> so you don’t rack up more unsecured debt and risk foreclosure on your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noclosingcostrefinance\">No-closing-cost refinance</h2>\n<p>We’ve talked about making sure you can afford the closing costs associated with a refinance. Most every refinance has them and you either pay them out of pocket or have the costs rolled into your loan. But there is a refinance that doesn’t charge any closing costs: the no-closing-cost refinance.</p>\n<p>This type of refinance sounds great when you consider closing costs may be $10,000 or more. But keep in mind that nothing is free. Your lender will make up for the lack of closing costs by charging a higher interest rate. If closing costs are added to the loan term, some lenders may refer to it as a no-closing-cost refinance because the borrower doesn’t need to pay the costs out of pocket at close. Either way, lenders will find a way to get their money.</p>\n<p>Consider a no-closing-cost refinance if you don’t have the funds to pay for closing costs and if the loan will save you money in the long run. Be sure to ask the lender <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/if-you-refinance-a-mortgage-when-will-you-break-even\">what your break-even point is</a> – that is, how long it takes to recoup the refinance costs through what you save each month by refinancing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helocrefinance\">HELOC refinance</h2>\n<p>A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a mortgage product that uses the equity in your home to give you a credit line. It’s a loan in addition to your mortgage, and its balance can fluctuate as you pay it off and use it again for anything from home repairs to a dream vacation. A HELOC refinance is when you combine the HELOC with your mortgage into a one 15-year or 30-year mortgage with one payment.</p>\n<p>Consider a HELOC refinance if you have a large HELOC balance that you can’t seem to pay down. HELOCs usually have higher interest rates than your primary mortgage so combining them and extending the term can help you pay the debt off. While most homeowners prefer the flexibility of the HELOC, if the interest is higher and you can’t pay it off, you might be better off refinancing it all into one, less expensive loan.</p>\n<p>To learn more about mortgages, <a href=\"/blog/tag/mortgages/\">check out our blog series</a>.</p>"

      title: "My House Burned Down! What to Do After a House Fire"
      body: "<p>Even a small house fire can have a devastating effect on a homeowner. At the very least, you can have smoke damage throughout your home, including areas that didn’t burn. In more severe fires, you may have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water damage.</li>\n<li>Broken windows</li>\n<li>Holes in your ceiling.</li>\n<li>Damage to your foundation, electrical system, and plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the potential property damage is often compounded by the emotional toll, which explains why homeowners may have a hard time knowing what their next steps should be. We’ve compiled this list of actions you can take if you ever experience a house fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1findasafeplacetostay\">1. Find a Safe Place to Stay</h2>\n<p>You likely won’t be able to stay in your home for some time after a house fire. In fact, you should not go into your house until the fire department gives the okay. This means that you need to find a safe place for you, your family, and any pets to stay. Doing this may require you call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friends or family.</li>\n<li>A hotel.</li>\n<li>A local chapter of the American Red Cross or Salvation Army.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these may be able to help you with temporary housing. You should also note that homeowners insurance often includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> that may pay for a portion of the cost of staying somewhere else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2contactyourinsurancecompany\">2. Contact Your Insurance Company</h2>\n<p>One piece of good news? <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance policies</a> typically cover the physical damage a fire causes, so get in touch with your insurer to get the <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">claims process</a> started ﹘ most have claims information on their websites. Once you’ve filed your claim, your insurance company will assign you a <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> to investigate your damages and assess your loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> While it’s not up to you to determine the cause, you should hold on to the item that you think started the fire. Remember, however, that you shouldn’t enter your home until fire authorities say it’s safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3protectyourhome\">3. Protect Your Home</h2>\n<p>Most insurance policies have a list of duties for the <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a> after a loss. One of these is usually to protect your property from further damage, so you want to do what you can to prevent bad weather or nefarious people from entering your home. In this situation, that most likely means informing the utilities that you had a fire and telling the police that your home may be vacant for a while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getacopyofthefirereport\">4. Get a Copy of the Fire Report</h2>\n<p>Your insurance claims adjuster will most likely want to see the fire report. It’s a public document in most cities, so you should be able to get it from the responding fire department. The fire report usually has important details, such as the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cause of the fire.</li>\n<li>Date the fire occurred.</li>\n<li>Fire department’s arrival time.</li>\n<li>Estimated losses.</li>\n<li>An incident number.</li>\n<li>Type of building.</li>\n<li>Presence of smoke detectors or fire alarms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5dealwithyourfinances\">5. Deal with Your Finances</h2>\n<p>Just because the home is temporarily uninhabitable doesn’t mean you’re off the hook for making mortgage payments. You need to pay these on time and in full while dealing with the claim. The same is likely true of your car payments, and you’ll still have everyday expenses. You may need to contact your bank and credit card companies to make sure you can access your cash.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that your home insurance may pay some of your additional living expenses after a fire, but policies often place <a href=\"/blog/additional-living-expenses-examples/\">limits on what expenses they cover</a>. Keep receipts for anything you buy as you deal with the aftermath of the fire to help you in your claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6replaceyourbelongings\">6. Replace Your Belongings</h2>\n<p>Replacing your personal property is a good step towards getting back to normal, but you’ll need to provide your insurance company with an itemized list of all the belongings lost in the fire. If you didn’t create a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> prior to the fire, keep receipts of anything that you buy to purchase to replace what was lost and give the receipts to your insurance adjuster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7replaceimportantdocuments\">7. Replace Important Documents</h2>\n<p>Any number of important documents may need to be replaced after a fire, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver's licenses.</li>\n<li>Auto registration.</li>\n<li>Property titles and deeds.</li>\n<li>Insurance policies.</li>\n<li>Warranties.</li>\n<li>Military discharge papers.</li>\n<li>Citizenship papers.</li>\n<li>Social security cards.</li>\n<li>Wills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may even be able to replace money that’s been destroyed by sending it to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing or taking it to your regional Federal Reserve Bank. This generally only applies to paper banknotes when more than half of a bill is intact. However, you may be able to replace small portions of banknotes if there’s evidence that shows the rest of the bill has been destroyed</p>\n<h2 id=\"8takecareofyourmentalhealth\">8. Take Care of Your Mental Health</h2>\n<p>Losing your physical belongings in a house fire is traumatic enough, but the experience can also cause emotional upheaval. You want to be on the lookout for {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cigna.com/individuals-families/health-wellness/coping-with-loss-due-to-fire\" text=\"signs that you or your loved ones need help\" >}}, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tearfulness.</li>\n<li>Insomnia.</li>\n<li>Nervousness.</li>\n<li>A loss of interest in activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the middle of a crisis, focusing on your mental health can be difficult, but it’s important. Be patient with yourself and your family as you recover and consider talking to a therapist to unpack all that you are feeling after the loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questionyoumayhaveafterahousefire\">Question You May Have After a House Fire</h2>\n<h3 id=\"shouldyoureplaceyourappliancesafterafire\">Should you replace your appliances after a fire?</h3>\n<p>Talk to your insurance claims representative about replacing your appliances. If the appliance was not directly involved in the fire, you likely only need to have it professionally cleaned and serviced. However, it’s often better to replace them completely if the appliance was involved in the fire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifyouaccidentallyburnyourhousedown\">What happens if you accidentally burn your house down?</h3>\n<p>If you accidentally burn your house down, you need to contact your insurance company immediately. Your insurer should be able to tell you whether your damage is covered based on the circumstance and your policy terms. Plus, you have an obligation to report losses, so you're better off alerting your insurance provider.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember after a house fire is that things can be replaced. Quality homeowners insurance can make sure of that.</p>"

Between pet claws and water dishes, floors can take a real beating, but you can minimize the damage by investing in {{< external-link url=\"https://floorauthority.com/blogs/tips/best-flooring-for-dogs\" text=\"flooring that stands up to pets\" >}}.</p>\n<p>Tile and vinyl flooring are both good options and come in a variety of colors, textures, and styles that you can customize to fit your home’s aesthetic. Even better? Both tile and vinyl flooring are resistant to various elements and require minimal maintenance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"refreshyourwalls\">Refresh your walls</h2>\n<p>A fresh paint job can give your walls new life, plus it’s one of the more fun projects to take on when remodeling or renovating your home. While we’re big fans of sprucing up your home with the <a href=\"/blog/spruce-up-your-home-with-the-color-of-the-year/\">color of the year</a>, pet owners may want to research a variety of paint types.</p>\n<p>Some paints hold up better against scrapes and are easier to clean. Others may be toxic stains, so you also want to be conscious of what {{< external-link url=\"https://www.petplay.com/blogs/tips/how-to-choose-the-right-paint-for-homes-with-pets\" text=\"paints are safest to use around pets\" >}}. It might be worth spending the money for a high-quality, non-toxic paint that doesn’t admit harsh fumes. Look for satin or semi-gloss finishes, as they are less likely to show wear and tear than flat or matte. They are also usually easier to touch up over the years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installbuiltingates\">Install built-in gates</h2>\n<p>Installing built-in and pocket gates around your home is a great addition when you’re concerned about safety. They can be installed next to cabinets in kitchens or in the walkways between rooms, so you can tuck them away until you need them.</p>\n<p>Having gates lets you close off rooms or spaces that you don’t want your pets to access. You can keep them out of the kitchen when you’re busy making dinner or away from a room that you’re cleaning. These added barriers are also very smart for homes with small children as they can double as baby gates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addfencesandlandscaping\">Add fences and landscaping</h2>\n<p>Making changes to your yard with your dog or cat in mind can offer them safety and while also improving the value of your property. A good example of this is fencing, which can create privacy for your family and keep your pets safe in your yard. When you add a fence, you want to take into account the size of your dog or the craftiness of your cat. These will impact both height and materials you use to create a fenced-in area they can’t escape.</p>\n<p>Another pet-friendly project is landscaping your yard so it offers shade for your animals in hot summer months. Just be sure to plant {{< external-link url=\"https://www.k9ofmine.com/best-dog-friendly-plants-for-yard/\" text=\"pet-safe trees and shrubs\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradeyourmudroom\">Upgrade your mudroom</h2>\n<p>Pet-friendly features in your mudroom can make a world of difference when you’re trying to keep your home dirt free. Some options you might want to install include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sink with a high-arc faucet or spray hose.</li>\n<li>A small tiled shower area.</li>\n<li>Shelving or cubbies to hold your pet’s gear, like leashes, coats, toys, and waste bags.</li>\n<li>A built-in kennel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these pet-friendly options have benefits for the humans in your family, too. Deep sinks or shower areas give you a place to hose off mud, and thoughtful storage is always a good idea for keeping your stuff organized.</p>\n<p>Looking for more ways to ensure your pet lives a long and love-filled life?

      title: "Pets and Fireworks: Keep Your Fur Kids Safe"
      body: "<p>If you’re a pet parent, you know furry friends are usually not amused by <a href=\"/blog/firework-damage-homeowners-insurance/\">fireworks</a> – in fact, most are downright terrified of them. Take a moment to consider the spectacle from their vantage point: unexplained bursts of bewildering light. The crashing BOOM as fireworks explode overhead. The smoke and smell of gunpowder lingering long after the display fades back into night. Factor in the cheers and applause from a crowd, and you have a recipe for sensory overload.</p>\n<p>It’s no wonder that more pets go missing on the Fourth of July than any other day of the year. In fact, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aspca.org/news/fourth-july-celebrate-pet-safety\" text=\"20 percent of pets go missing\" >}} after being scared by loud noises, according to the ASPCA.</p>\n<p>Even pets who aren’t typically prone to anxiety can be scared of the loud noises brought on by fireworks. If your pet is fearful or anxious, they may pace, pant, tremble, hide, salivate, growl, or whine.</p>\n<p>So what can we do to make our companions more comfortable while we celebrate? Here are some tips to keep your four-legged loves safe as the Fourth of July approaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1keeppetsawayfromfireworks\">1. Keep Pets Away from Fireworks</h2>\n<p>Fireworks are dangerous, full stop. They sent {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/2019-Fireworks-Annual-Report.pdf?La<em>ZzaoEeI</em>FXhMNJSoIyO8BhrBbcA4B\" text=\"10,000 people\" >}} to the ER for injuries in 2019, and 58 percent of those injuries were burns. But animals get hurt, too. According to the ASPCA, every Fourth of July, Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) sees an uptick in calls over pets who have ingested fireworks, which are full of chemicals and heavy metals.</p>\n<p>So don’t risk your pet’s emotional or physical wellbeing by letting them around fireworks. Keep them safely indoors, and make sure they don’t go outside unattended. You don’t want the loud noises to cause them to bolt. If you can’t leave your pet at home, keep them leashed and under your supervision.</p>\n<p>If you set off fireworks at home, thoroughly clean up so your curious pup doesn’t eat the remnants. If your pet does ingest fireworks, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\" text=\"contact Animal Poison Control\" >}} or take your pet to the emergency vet right away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2registeryourpetsmicrochip\">2. Register Your Pet’s Microchip</h2>\n<p>If your fur baby gets loose on the Fourth, a registered microchip can make a world of difference in how quickly you reunite. So if you haven’t already, this is your sign to get your pet microchipped and registered. Microchipping costs about $45 at most vet offices. Registering the microchip at a pet recovery database costs around $20 a year. Be sure to keep the database up to date with your most recent contact information, including your address and phone number.</p>\n<p>These are some of the most common pet recovery databases where you can register the microchip:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://microchipregistry.foundanimals.org/\" text=\"Found Animals\" >}} (this one is free)</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.homeagain.com/\" text=\"HomeAgain\" >}} (most popular)</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.akcreunite.org/\" text=\"AKC Reunite\" >}}</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.petlink.net/us/welcome\" text=\"PetLink\" >}}</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.24petwatch.com/US/\" text=\"24PetWatch\" >}}</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://marrsmicrochip.com/\" text=\"ACA's Microchip Animal Rapid Recovery Services\" >}}</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.homewardboundpet.com/\" text=\"Homeward Bound Pet\" >}}</li>\n<li>{{< external-link url=\"https://petkey.org/\" text=\"Petkey\" >}}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an extra precaution, you might want to make sure your pets are wearing collars with ID tags in case they make a desperate attempt to escape the noise. ID tags should have the name of your pet, your address, and your phone number.</p>\n<p>If your pet does go missing, contact local animal shelters, animal control, and your vet. You can also report your lost pet on the microchip registry.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/pet-disaster-preparedness/\">Pet Disaster Preparedness: Keep Your Pets Safe in an Emergency</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keepyourpetspleasantlydistracted\">3. Keep Your Pets Pleasantly Distracted</h2>\n<p>Fireworks are jarring, but the easy viewing of Animal Planet may be just what your stressed pooch needs to keep their mind off the chaos outside. Turning on some music or TV can help soften the intermittent noises from fireworks and ease the effect for your pets.</p>\n<p>If you don’t plan on going out for celebrations that night, you can curl up with your favorite fur friend and give them a pet of reassurance when the noise gives them a fright.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4askyourvetforhelp\">4. Ask Your Vet for Help</h2>\n<p>If your companion has serious anxiety, it might be worthwhile to explore some treatments at the direction of your vet. For example, your vet may recommend trying a {{< external-link url=\"https://thundershirt.com/\" text=\"Thundershirt\" >}}, which applies pressure to the chest and helps ease anxiety for many noise-averse pets. If you don’t have one, a snug t-shirt may do the trick.</p>\n<p>Your vet may also recommend anti-anxiety medication, depending on the severity. Your vet may suggest you give a trial dose to see how your pet does before the Fourth of July. Remember that pets have a very different tolerance for medications than humans, and you should administer the medication exactly as your vet prescribes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5watchoutforheatstroke\">5. Watch Out for Heat Stroke</h2>\n<p>With record highs sweeping the US, you probably don’t need us to remind you how dangerous the heat can be for your four-legged pals (and humans, for that matter). That’s yet another reason to keep your pets safely inside during the Fourth of July: you don’t want to run the risk of heat stroke. If your pet must be outside, make sure they have ample access to shade and water, and keep an eye out for these signs of heat stroke:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive panting.</li>\n<li>Increased heart rate.</li>\n<li>Confusion or disorientation.</li>\n<li>Vomiting or diarrhea.</li>\n<li>Bright red gums.</li>\n<li>Body temperature higher than 104° F.</li>\n<li>Collapse, seizure, or coma.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that hot pavement can burn your pup’s paws, so if you can’t hold your hand on the ground for five seconds, it’s not safe for your dog’s sweet feet either.</p>\n<p>Don’t leave your pet in a parked car, even if it doesn’t seem that warm. No matter how cool it may seem outside, temperatures in closed vehicles can climb to 116 degrees in less than an hour, which can be fatal.</p>\n<p>There you have it, friends. Have a safe and happy 4th, and give your dogs a hug for us.</p>"

      title: "Protecting homes in flood areas in South Carolina"
      body: "<p>One of the most common misconceptions about <a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina home insurance</a> is that it covers any damage that happens to your home. Flooding is a good example of this. Few, if any, homeowners policies cover water damage if it’s caused by a flood.</p>\n<p>For many homeowners, especially those living in flood areas in South Carolina, that means two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to take steps to guard against flooding.</li>\n<li>You may need an additional flood insurance policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can you protect your home against all of nature’s unpredictabilities? Probably not. But you can reduce their impacts through risk mitigation and insurance – and that starts with identifying your particular risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at South Carolina flood zones so you can protect your home from flooding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherearethefloodareasinsouthcarolina\">Where are the flood areas in South Carolina?</h2>\n<p>Floods damage is a real possibility for most of the Palmetto State. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has found “flood-prone areas in every county, city, and town” across the state, according to the department’s <a href=\"https://www.dnr.sc.gov/water/flood/documents/SCQG_FloodplainManagement.pdf\">guide to floodplain management</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, people living closer to the coast are more vulnerable to the very dangerous flood that comes during South Carolina hurricane season, like the Beaufort county SC flood zones. Other coastal counties in South Carolina that are susceptible to flooding include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charleston.</li>\n<li>Berkeley.</li>\n<li>Colleton.</li>\n<li>Dorchester.</li>\n<li>Georgetown.</li>\n<li>Horry.</li>\n<li>Jasper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the only places where floods can occur, but the high risk for potentially catastrophic flooding makes them worth a special mention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzones\">Flood zones</h3>\n<p>Up until now, we’ve referenced flood areas in a fairly general way, but South Carolina residents also need to know about <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) labels certain areas as flood zones based on the degree of flooding that’s likely to occur.</p>\n<p>You can find out if your home is in a flood zone by visiting the <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search\">FEMA Flood Map Service Center</a> and entering your address. For example, we searched Beaufort SC flood zones and found that much of the county is either <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">VE</a>. The same was true on the Charleston, SC, flood zone map.</p>\n<p>Both AE and VE flood zones have a high risk of flooding, but the reasons for the risk are different. Flood Zone AE indicates the area is near floodplains, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water. Flood Zone VE are usually coastal areas where homeowners also face the risk of storm surge.</p>\n<p>Either way, FEMA designates these and other flood zones as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Homes in an SFHA have a 26% chance of experiencing a flood during a thirty-year mortgage, so owners typically have to get flood insurance in order to get federally backed loans.</p>\n<p>While the risk for floods is greater in some places, you should note that flooding can happen almost anywhere. FEMA estimates that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/faq/low-risk-flood-zones\">25% of flood claims</a> are from areas with low-to-moderate flood risk. Worse? Some question if <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-maps/\">FEMA flood maps are accurate</a>, in part because they don’t account for climate change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtohardenyourhomeagainstfloodinginsouthcarolina\">How to Harden Your Home Against Flooding in South Carolina</h2>\n<p>The homes, people, and businesses in the flood areas in South Carolina may be impacted every year by excessive rainfall, overflowing rivers, storm surges, and more. According to the <a href=\"https://riskfactor.com/state/southcarolina/45_fsid/flood\">most recent information from Risk Factor</a>, there are more than 358,000 properties that are at risk for experiencing floods. That number is only expected to increase each year as sea levels rise and more people move to the state.</p>\n<p>Getting the right insurance is essential to recovering from South Carolina flood damage, but you also want to think about how you can minimize it in the first place. Some steps you can take include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Elevating your systems.</strong> Some flood zones have <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevations</a> (BFE), or the height water is expected to rise during flooding. If your area has a BFE, you may want to make sure your electrical systems and furnace are above it.</li>\n<li><strong>Updating your flooring.</strong> Switching from carpeting to tile may reduce the amount of damage you see in a flood.</li>\n<li><strong>Floodproofing your basement.</strong> A sump pump is one option, but you may also want to seal the walls of your basement with waterproof compounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing windows and doors.</strong> Make sure these are tightly sealed with caulk. While you're at it, check for gaps anywhere pipes or wires enter your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Directing water away from your foundation.</strong> Probably the easiest way to do this is to position rain spouts so the water runs towards your yard, but you could also make sure your landscaping slopes away from your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips, read our article <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\"><em>6 tips to minimize your risk of flood and water damage</em></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodinsuranceinsouthcarolinafaqs\">Flood insurance in South Carolina: FAQs</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, we do not currently offer flood insurance in South Carolina. But as a home insurance company dedicated to bringing coverage to people in catastrophe-prone areas, we know how important it is for our members to have the information they need to protect their homes. The following answers to some of the most common questions about flood insurance in South Carolina will hopefully help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doineedfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">Do I need flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>It depends! While your mortgage company may require you to get flood insurance if you’re in a SFHA, you may still want coverage. In SC, flooding areas are abundant, and most homeowners policies don’t provide financial protection against flood loss. The likelihood of floods, and the damage they can cause, makes flood insurance a good idea for most people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howmuchisfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">How much is flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The cost of flood insurance depends on several factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your flood zone.</li>\n<li>The design and age of your home.</li>\n<li>Whether or not your utilities are elevated.</li>\n<li>The amount of coverage you want.</li>\n<li>The deductible you choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many homeowners get their flood coverage from FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program, but some opt for private flood insurers. Both can end up saving them money in the long run because they save homeowners from dipping into their personal savings to make repairs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyshouldigetfloodinsuranceinsouthcarolina\">Why should I get flood insurance in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>Life is unpredictable, and insurance provides protection for those unexpected instances that cause loss. No one wants their home to flood, but it’s seldom up to us. Flood insurance can provide significant financial relief if your home is subject to catastrophic flooding, especially a last-minute <a href=\"/blog/what-is-flash-flooding/\">flash flood</a>, by giving you the ability to quickly return to your usual way of life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"willhomeownersinsurancecoverflooddamageduringahurricaneinsouthcarolina\">Will homeowners insurance cover flood damage during a hurricane in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>Homeowner’s insurance policies generally exclude the type of water damage caused by hurricane storm surge. That’s why flood insurance is so important in areas along South Carolina’s coast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdofloodsoccurinsouthcarolina\">How do floods occur in South Carolina?</h3>\n<p>The main culprits of South Carolina inland flooding is the state’s hot, humid environment and low-lying landscape. Riverine overflows also contribute to the number of flood areas in South Carolina, threatening the safety of more inland homes. And as a coastal state, South Carolina is also at risk for storm surge during hurricane season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h3>\n<p>Understanding what your home insurance covers and what it excludes is key to making sure you have the right protection. For most South Carolina homeowners, flood damage falls in the category of “not covered.” That’s only tragic if you don’t take steps to protect your home.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the steps you need to take aren’t difficult: Identify your flood risk, harden your home against damage, and get flood insurance. Will any of those prevent floods? No. But they can make it easier to recover should you find yourself facing the worst-case scenario.</p>"

      title: "Psychology of Interior Design: A Crash Course"
      body: "<p>There’s no question that your space affects your mood. That’s why it can feel so good to come home after a long day and curl up on your couch. Understanding the psychology of interior design can help you choose elements that beautify your home while also lifting your mood and supporting your wellbeing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthepsychologyofinteriordesign\">What Is the Psychology of Interior Design?</h2>\n<p>Interior design psychology is the study of how people interact with the spaces around them and how the elements of those spaces impact their emotional wellbeing. These elements can include anything from light and color to textures and open spaces, and all of which play a role in how we feel in our environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lightdesignandyourmood\">Light Design and Your Mood</h2>\n<p>Light, particularly natural light, has a dramatic impact on your mood. Health experts have found that {{< external-link url=\"https://www.tricitymed.org/2018/08/5-ways-the-sun-impacts-your-mental-and-physical-health/\" text=\"exposure to sunlight raises serotonin\" >}}, a chemical your body produces that helps reduce anxiety and depression, which may lead you to choose translucent curtains or add a skylight in a room.</p>\n<p>Allowing natural light to shine through windows can brighten your mood, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use artificial light, too. You just want to choose the type of light bulb that’s appropriate for the function of the area and the mood you’re trying to create.</p>\n<p>Designers will often use brighter lighting in workspaces﹘the places where you need to see what you’re doing, like your kitchen. But you can choose softer lighting to create a more relaxed feeling in other spaces.</p>\n<h2 id=\"colorchoicesimpactemotions\">Color Choices Impact Emotions</h2>\n<p>You may be familiar with color psychology as something advertisers use to influence consumers, but homeowners can also use it in various rooms to evoke a feeling, encourage conversations, or even make a room feel bigger.</p>\n<p>Blues and grays, for example, are popular in living rooms because of their calming effect. In areas where you want more energy, stimulating colors like red and yellow get used more often. This is especially important in areas where people gather such as kitchens and family rooms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"balancingcomfortfunctionandspace\">Balancing Comfort, Function, and Space</h2>\n<p>People tend to feel less anxious in a room when the furniture is arranged in a way that’s both pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate. But people usually want sofas and chairs that are comfortable and inviting. That can be a hard balance to strike, especially when you’re talking about size. A big, comfy couch may call your name in the store, but it might overwhelm your living room once you bring it home.</p>\n<p>The trick with furniture is to find the balance between something that is comfortable and something that doesn’t take over the space, making it feel small. Luckily, current <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">interior design trends</a> include minimalism in the form of Japandi and maximalism. While these trends have distinctly different looks, either can support your mood depending on your personality. The multitude of colors and textures on top of big, cozy furniture you find in maximalism could be just the thing for someone who desires comfort. But if that look feels cluttered to you, then you may want to consider the clean lines of minimalism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingspacewithorganization\">Creating Space with Organization</h2>\n<p>People tend to be happier and more creative in spacious areas. But for those of us who don’t have tons of square footage and vaulted ceilings, we can create a sense of space with smart organization.</p>\n<p>Organization should be a key element in the design of every room in your house. The first step is to arrange your furniture so that it encourages interaction and allows people to move around it easily. However, clutter can ruin the spaciousness your layout creates, so the next step is to remove as much clutter as you can. Everything should have a place in your home. That may mean getting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Files systems to deal with the paper in the home office.</li>\n<li>Drawer organizers and utensil holders for your kitchen.</li>\n<li>Bins and baskets to corral kids toys and games.</li>\n<li>Furniture with built-in storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When everything has a place to go, it's easier to find what you're looking for.</p>"

      title: "Puppy proofing your home to keep everyone safe"
      body: "<p>Few events create as much excitement as bringing a new puppy into your home. That little ball of fur will have you wrapped around its paw in no time! But while a puppy’s energetic antics are often endearing, the combo can make your new pupper a less-than-ideal housemate.</p>\n<p>If you have a new puppy or plan to get one soon (lucky!), you're going to want to puppy proof your living space. Here are our top puppy proofing tips to keep you, your dog, and all of your loved ones healthy and safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"socializeyourpuppy\">Socialize your puppy</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do for your new pup is to socialize it. You want your dog to be comfortable in new environments, and socialization is the key. “Socializing” simply means teaching your dog how to behave with other people and animals, and you can do it by exposing your puppy to new situations.</p>\n<p>Almost everything is new for a puppy, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities for socialization. For example, a walk around your neighborhood may lead to interactions with senior citizens and children alike. A puppy playdate might give your new dog a chance to walk on hardwood floors. All of these can improve your doggo’s confidence and behavior.</p>\n<p>Good socialization makes your dog less likely to act aggressively even when it's afraid. Some <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> covers damages if your dog hurts someone outside of your family, but you need to check your policy. Lots of states require you to add <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"createasafeplacetoexplore\">Create a safe place to explore</h2>\n<p>Your new puppy is a bundle of curiosity, and investigating the world is an important part of socialization. However, you want to make sure your pup is protected as it explores. Doors leading to the outside or to risky areas (e.g., a basement) need to be closed, and stairs should be blocked with a baby gate.</p>\n<p>The ideal situation for exploring the outdoors is a yard with a fence that your dog can’t jump over, squeeze through, or dig under. If that’s not possible, then you want to always have your dog on a leash, even in your yard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closewindowsandfixscreens\">Close windows and fix screens</h2>\n<p>Your puppy’s powerful sniffer may lead it to investigate breezes coming in from outside, so you want to make sure that you either close your windows or that your screens are in good repair. The idea that a beloved but nosey pet might fall from a window is tragic, but veterinarians treat victims of {{< external-link url=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119028994.ch162\" text=\"high-rise syndrome\" >}} all the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"securecords\">Secure cords</h2>\n<p>While you're checking your windows and screens, take a look at your curtains and blinds. Puppies like to pull anything that can be pulled, and that includes cords of all kinds. You may be able to puppy proof these by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tying up the excess.</li>\n<li>Cutting the loop in the cord so it’s not a choking hazard.</li>\n<li>Adding a hook to the wall to secure them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Electrical cords can also be a problem. You may be able to hide them in cord concealers or behind furniture that your puppy can’t access. Another option is to use a deterrent spray on exposed cords to discourage your puppy from playing with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makeharmfulplacesofflimits\">Make harmful places off-limits</h2>\n<p>Puppies learn about the world around them using all of their senses, including taste. That means they’re likely to use their mouths to pick up all sorts of harmful items. Take a look at your home from that point of view, and you’ll see lots of areas that should be off-limits to Fido. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your garage.</li>\n<li>Your basement.</li>\n<li>Under sinks.</li>\n<li>Sheds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you store chemicals like antifreeze, cleaning solutions, and fertilizer or sharp tools in any of these places, then you want to minimize your pup’s access to them. Think, too, about trash cans under the sink or in your backyard. You may see this as just garbage, but your dog can find the smell irresistible, so make sure you have secure lids.</p>\n<h2 id=\"storemedicationssafely\">Store medications safely</h2>\n<p>Keeping medications out is handy for you, but your new puppy will find more ways to climb up a kitchen counter or nightstand then you can imagine. Play it safe and puppy proof all your medications in a medicine cabinet that is well out of the reach of your pup.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> You might also want to store your pet’s medication in a place other than yours. Not only does that help you avoid mix-ups, but it may limit Rover’s interest in your meds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnabouttoxicplants\">Learn about toxic plants</h2>\n<p>Chemicals and medicines aren’t the only things your puppy might eat that can be harmful. Both indoor and outdoor plants may be poisonous, too. Take a look at this {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants?field<em>toxicity</em>value%5B%5D=01\" text=\"list of toxic plants\" >}} from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Once you know, then you can either put your plants out of your pupper’s reach or get rid of them altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepbatteriesawayfrompuppies\">Keep batteries away from puppies</h2>\n<p>Like we said, puppies like to chew just about everything. That’s annoying on its own, but it can turn dangerous if your dog gets its mouth on something with a battery. While your dog is young, put your key fobs, remote controls, and other battery-operated items on high shelves.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Always have your veterinarian’s number on hand as well as the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\" text=\"ASPCA’s poison control hotline\" >}} at 888-426-4435.</p>\n<p>Puppy proofing your home is an important part of getting a new dog, but what do you do in an emergency situation?

      title: "Raising Backyard Chickens: The Essential Guide"
      body: "<p>Picture this: you wake up one sunny morning with an inexplicable craving for an omelet. You head outside, greeted by the joyous clucks of your backyard chickens who you know by name: Henifer Aniston, Eggatha Christie, Yolko Ono, and Hilary Fluff. You open the nesting box hatch and find four beautiful eggs waiting for you like a gift.</p>\n<p>It’s the farm-to-table dream, only you don’t need a lot of land to make it a reality.</p>\n<p>While keeping backyard chickens is a type of urban agriculture that’s been around for years, it’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/03/826925180/we-are-swamped-coronavirus-propels-interest-in-raising-backyard-chickens-for-egg\" text=\"gained popularity since the onset of the pandemic\" >}}. More homeowners are finding that hens make wonderful companions, are easy to care for, and (of course) offer a steady supply of fresh eggs.</p>\n<p>But before you take the plunge into urban chicken keeping, do your research to make sure it’s the right fit for you and your family. Let’s explore the pros and cons of backyard chickens, chicken ordinances and permits, coop setup, chicken breeds to consider, and basic care for a healthy, happy flock.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isthebackyardchickenlifeforyou\">Is the Backyard Chicken Life for You?</h2>\n<p>Like any animal you bring into your home, backyard chickens require time and money to care for them properly. For chickens, consider how much space you have and whether raising them runs <em>afowl</em> of local ordinances (we couldn’t resist the pun). This list can help you weigh the benefits and potential disadvantages of keeping backyard chickens.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"prosandconsofbackyardchickens\">Pros and Cons of Backyard Chickens</h3>\n<p>| Benefits | Drawbacks |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fresh eggs | Limited egg-producing years |\n| Minimal space requirements | Upfront costs |\n| Education for the family | Noise |\n| Pest control | Chicken coop odors |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<h4 id=\"fresheggs\">Fresh Eggs</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/fresh-eggs.jpg\" alt=\"hand with three eggs and three hens in the background\" />Clearly, one of the top reasons people decide to raise backyard chickens is for the eggs. Farm-fresh (or backyard-fresh) eggs have less cholesterol and saturated fat while providing more vitamin A, E, and D, as well as more omega-3 fatty acids. Plus, they’re delicious.</p>\n<p>If learning how to raise chickens for eggs is your top concern, you’ll be happy to know that you can expect about five to six eggs per week per chicken (depending on the breed). However, most hens reach their peak production when they’re 30-weeks old. By year seven, you’ll see less than half of your chicken’s original egg production. But remember, your hen is not an egg vending machine, and their companionship is rewarding, too!</p>\n<h4 id=\"spacerequirements\">Space Requirements</h4>\n<p>One reason urban chickens are so popular is because chickens generally don’t need a lot of space. Experts typically say you need about four square feet of space in the coop and 10 square feet in the run per chicken, which many backyards can accommodate. Be sure to check your city’s regulations, though. Some towns may require your coop to be a certain distance away from any living space.</p>\n<h4 id=\"costs\">Costs</h4>\n<p>Backyard chickens cost about $69 per month to raise five chickens over five years, and most of those expenses are upfront costs, like chicken coops, waterers, and feeders. Chicken coops alone can cost anywhere from $100 to $5,000. Ongoing costs aren’t usually as steep, but you definitely want to consider how much it might take to bring your chicken to the vet. It’s also worth noting that not all vets are trained in treating chickens.</p>\n<h4 id=\"educationforyourfamily\">Education for Your Family</h4>\n<p>Taking care of an animal can be a great learning experience, and people who learn how to raise backyard chickens report spending more quality time with their children. Depending on their age, your children can help with feeding your backyard chickens, collecting eggs, or cleaning the chicken coop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"noisepestcontrolandodors\">Noise, Pest Control, and Odors</h4>\n<p>First, let’s clear up a misconception: You don’t need a rooster if you want chickens for eggs. Hens naturally lay unfertilized eggs with or without a rooster present. In fact, many towns don’t allow roosters in city limits.</p>\n<p>That said, hens can be noisy birds, especially before they lay their eggs. {{< external-link url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPNa5mkjR7A\" text=\"Ever heard an egg song\" >}}? Delightful! But your neighbors may disagree, so that’s something to consider.</p>\n<p>Both you and your neighbors will likely appreciate that hens are excellent for pest control. Many breeds eat ticks and mosquitoes, as well as slugs, hookworms, grasshoppers, and centipedes.</p>\n<p>And if you’re thinking of <a href=\"/blog/how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden/\">starting a vegetable garden</a>, you’ll have a nearly endless supply of chicken manure to use as fertilizer. Be sure to clean the coop at least once per week to keep the odor down and keep your chickens clean and healthy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cityordinancesandbackyardhens\">City Ordinances and Backyard Hens</h2>\n<p>Your local government may have rules about backyard chickens that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict the number or type of chickens you can have.</li>\n<li>Require you to get a permit.</li>\n<li>Limit your chickens’ proximity to your home.</li>\n<li>Mandate the size and materials of your chicken coop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, a {{< external-link url=\"https://library.municode.com/fl/fort<em>myers/codes/code</em>of<em>ordinances?nodeId=SPAADCO</em>CH54NU_ARTIINGE\" text=\"Fort Myers, Florida city ordinance\" >}} prohibits chicken coops within 300 feet of a dwelling, and homeowners can only have one hen per 800 square feet of their total lot. {{< external-link url=\"https://www.orlando.gov/Building-Development/Planning-Approvals/Apply-for-a-Backyard-Chicken-Permit\" text=\"Orlando allows backyard chickens\" >}}, but you need a permit and the city only issues 100 of them on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>\n<p>Each city and county is different, so research the ordinances in your area. And while you may hear more about <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restrictions on dogs</a>, homeowners associations may also ban chickens.</p>\n<p>And as long as we're looking at regulations, you may want to give your insurance representative a call. They can make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> protects your new coop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chickencoopsbasicshelterrequirements\">Chicken Coops: Basic Shelter Requirements</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/coop.jpg\" alt=\"a buff orpington hen with chicks in front of a blue chicken coop with attached run\" /></p>\n<p><em>An example of a coop with a small attached chicken run.</em></p>\n<p>Chickens require a safe, secure, and insulated coop and a secured outdoor area – called a run – where they can peck in peace. A coop should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide at least four square feet of space per bird.</li>\n<li>Offer shelter from the sun, wind, or cold.</li>\n<li>Have good ventilation to maintain optimal temperatures for your hens – not too hot and not too cold.</li>\n<li>Provide at least one nesting box for every three hens.</li>\n<li>Have roosts (perches) where the birds can sleep at night.</li>\n<li>Have a door that opens into the run.</li>\n<li>Be predator-proof – foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and dogs prey on unsecured flocks, so keep your girls safe!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A note about the importance of chicken runs: though you may want your flock to freely roam your entire yard, make sure there’s a dedicated outdoor space that’s fully secured with chicken-wire. That’s because ground predators aren’t the only ones who have a taste for chicken – birds of prey have been known to snatch up free roaming hens, too. When you aren’t able to supervise your chickens, it’s nice to know they have access to a sunlit space where predators can’t hurt them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findingyourfirstbackyardchickens\">Finding Your First Backyard Chickens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/backyard-chickens-3.jpg\" alt=\"two Red Star hens, a hybrid breed known for their beautiful color and high egg production.\" /></p>\n<p><em>Red Star hens, pictured above, are a hybrid breed known for their beautiful color and high egg production.</em></p>\n<p>Now that you know you want to raise backyard chickens and it’s legal in your area, it’s time to choose the right breed. Keep in mind that chickens are very social animals – most don’t thrive without a friend. <strong>Plan to have at least two birds</strong> so they can keep each other company and snuggle for warmth if you live in a colder climate.</p>\n<p>As you explore chicken breeds, think about why you’re getting chickens and the environment you’ll bring them into. These questions can help you decide which breed to get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do my chickens need to tolerate the heat?</strong> If so, look for Mediterranean breeds, such as leghorns and Penedesencas. Their small, sleek bodies and large combs help them remain cool in hot, humid temperatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Do my chickens need to tolerate the cold?</strong> Homeowners in colder areas might consider large-bodied breeds, like australorps, Buff or Blue Orpingtons, and Wyandottes. Their thicker bodies are better able to keep them warm in colder conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Is egg production important?</strong> Australorps, leghorns, and Rhode Island reds are good choices when you want lots of eggs. Each chicken can provide up to six eggs per week throughout the spring and summer months. But if you only want eggs for your family, a medium producer like bantam chickens (which is actually a size, not a breed) may be a good fit because of their smaller eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Will children be near my chickens?</strong> If so, look for birds with mild temperaments, like australorps and brahmas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtocareforbackyardchickens\">How to Care for Backyard Chickens</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/chicken-roost.jpg\" alt=\"two blue orpington hens perched on a roost\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re raising your chickens from the time they’re chicks, you’ll need to have the following supplies on hand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A brooder.</strong> This can be as simple as a box or a storage bin filled with pine shavings. Just make sure it’s tall enough so the chicks can’t jump out. Chicks are messy little things, so keep their brooder, waterer, and feeders clean. Litter should be cleaned daily, and sometimes more frequently if it gets wet.</li>\n<li><strong>Food and water dispensers.</strong> Fill their feeder with chick starter feed crumbles (found at any farm supply store) and make sure they have access to fresh water. When you first put the chicks in the brooder, dip their beaks in their food and water so they know where to find it.</li>\n<li><strong>Warmth.</strong> Chicks don’t have feathers until they are 6 to 7 weeks old and can’t regulate their own temperature until then. Use a heat lamp or a hen-safe heat plate to keep the brooder warm. During their first week, the temperature should be 95 degrees, and you can lower it by five degrees each week until ambient temperature is reached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chicks are usually ready for the coop at about 12 weeks. You can introduce them to the outdoors sooner, but be sure to supervise and limit their roaming area with a pen or mini run.</p>\n<p>Once full grown, chickens don’t demand a lot of care, but a consistent routine can keep them healthy and happy. A typical day might go like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morning.</strong> Let your chickens out of the coop so that they can access the chicken run. Check each hen for signs of good health, such as bright eyes, red comb and wattles, and shiny feathers. Give them fresh food and water, fluff the coop bedding, and look for eggs.</li>\n<li><strong>Afternoon.</strong> Sometimes chickens lay eggs later in the day, so check for them again in the afternoon.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening.</strong> As the sun goes down, your hens will head to the coop on their own, but check for stragglers. Close the door that leads to the run so they are safe from predators. If you live in a colder climate, you may want to give your chickens some scratch grains. This is a combination of seeds and grains, and it can help keep them warm overnight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At least once a week, clean the coop and chicken run. This is the time to rake the old bedding out of the coop and replace it and to give your feeders and waterers a good scrub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commonchickenproblemstoplanfor\">Common Chicken Problems to Plan For</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/hen.jpg\" alt=\"a hybrid maron hen with an orange neck and black saddle feathers\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re a first-time hen keeper, be prepared for a little learning curve. Chickens have some unique quirks that can be alarming to the uninitiated. Let’s look at a few problems to plan for so they don’t take you by surprise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"predators\">Predators</h3>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, though mighty, the chicken is dinner to almost everyone. Even your family dog could accidentally harm or kill them if you’re not careful. Don’t assume that because you’re in the city that a wily woodland creature or a hawk won’t hunt them if given the chance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peckingorder\">Pecking Order</h3>\n<p>Named for this chicken behavior, a pecking order establishes the flock hierarchy through actual pecking. If a hen jumps her place in line for food, the hen in charge will let her know with a definitive peck. If bullying gets out of hand and your hens have plenty of space, it might be a sign that your hens are bored. Adding toys (yes, hens like toys!) or a “flock block,” a heavy supplement block made with grains that encourages pecking, can help keep them entertained.</p>\n<h3 id=\"molting\">Molting</h3>\n<p>Molting is when your chicken sheds old feathers and grows new plumage. Their first molt usually happens when they’re 16 to 18 months old. The process often takes three months to complete and usually happens once a year. Be aware that it can be really stressful for your birds and may impact egg production.</p>\n<h3 id=\"broodiness\">Broodiness</h3>\n<p>You’ll know a broody hen when you see one. She often won’t leave her nesting box, puffs up her feathers, and gets feisty if anyone dares to disturb her. Hens get broody when they want their eggs to hatch, so if that’s not in the cards for your girls, you’ll want to intervene. Try removing her from the nesting box, but be careful – broody hens may bite and their beaks are no joke.</p>\n<p>Excited for your chickens to come home to roost? Or do you already have a flock?

      title: "Replace these 4 recalled electrical panels ASAP"
      body: "<p>Outdated and recalled electrical panels pose a big fire risk, which is why they can prevent you from getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Though they are most commonly found in older homes that haven't been updated, check to make sure your home doesn't have one of these four recalled electrical panels to be safe.</p>\n<p>If your home does have one of these panels, work with a licensed electrician to replace it as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4recalledelectricalpanels\">4 recalled electrical panels</h2>\n<p>Electrical panels, sometimes called load centers or breaker panels, are service boxes that contain your main power line and distribute electricity to circuits throughout your home. If the panel fails to operate as expected, it can send too much electrical current through a circuit and cause a fire.</p>\n<p>Old electrical panels are usually found during the <a href=\"/glossary/home-inspection/\">home inspection</a> before you buy, but inspectors can miss them. The following panels are considered out of date or have been involved in an electrical panel recall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Stab-Lok panels</li>\n<li>Zinsco panels, also known as GTE Sylvania-Zinsco panels</li>\n<li>Challenger panels made by Challenger Electrical Equipment Corp or Eaton/Cutler Hammer</li>\n<li>Pushmatic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"federalpacificelectric\">Federal Pacific Electric</h3>\n<p>FPE panels were a popular electrical panel and were widely used starting in the 1950s through 1990. However, Stab-lok panels can fail to trip when a circuit is overloaded, causing the system to overheat and potentially ignite a fire. This issue led the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to investigate Stab-Lok panels in the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>While FPE Stab-Lok panels were never actually recalled, most electricians recommend removing them. Here are a few ways you may be able to recognize FPE Stab-loks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Pacific Electric or FPE stamped into the metal cover.</li>\n<li>An information sticker on the inside that reads Federal Pacific Electric, Federal Pioneer FPE, or Stab-lock.</li>\n<li>Breakers with a red stripe on each switch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"zinsco\">Zinsco</h3>\n<p>Many homes built or updated in the 1970s, particularly those in the western portion of the county, have electrical panels made by Zinsco. Unfortunately, these panels have several design flaws that create a serious electrical panel fire hazard, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insecure connections between breakers and bus bars (the part that distributes power).</li>\n<li>Components made of aluminium that need to be replaced at 30 years.</li>\n<li>Bus bars that corrode easily.</li>\n<li>Breakers that melt into the bus bar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, Zinsco panels may continue to conduct electricity even when the breaker appears to be off.</p>\n<p>Zinsco was purchased by GTE Sylvania in 1973, so you want to check your electrical panels for the following names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zinsco</li>\n<li>Sylvania</li>\n<li>GTE-Sylvania</li>\n<li>Sylvania-Zinsco</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also look for bright red, blue, and green tabs on the individual breakers, but treat this as a rule of thumb. Zinsco electrical panels can also have black breakers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"challenger\">Challenger</h3>\n<p>During the 1980s and early 1990s, Challenger electrical panels were installed into hundreds of thousands of homes, but they were {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1988/challenger-electrical-equipment-corp-offers-replacement-program-for-9000-gfci-circuit\" text=\"recalled in 1988\" >}}. That recall specifically focused on Challenger panels with 15- and 20- ampere circuit breakers made between February and April of 1988 that have a mechanical component that can detach leading to overheating, melting, and fire.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, problems with these panels continued even after Eaton/Cutler Hammer purchased Challenger. In 2014, Eaton/Cutler Hammer recalled 1,000 panels because their easily accessed components presented a shock risk.</p>\n<p>You may have a Challenger electrical panel that you need to replace if you see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Challenger stamped on the handle or door.</li>\n<li>Challenger on the manufacturer’s label (often found on the inside of the panel door).</li>\n<li>Circuits with yellow buttons and the word “test” on one side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that Challenger parts can show up in other electrical panels, including those made by GTE Slyvania and Zinsco.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pushmatic\">Pushmatic</h3>\n<p>Pushmatic panels were popular from 1950 through 1980. During that time, the Pushmatic system wasn’t known to have any fire hazard, but it’s now considered an outdated system and should be replaced. Be forewarned that you can still buy new Pushmatic components. However, these parts may not be compatible with the original Pushmatic electrical panel.</p>\n<p>Identifying a Pushmatic panel is relatively easy. Unlike most panels that have right to left switches, a Pushmatic has rectangular buttons that activate and deactivate circuits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"electricalpanelsafetytips\">Electrical panel safety tips</h2>\n<p>Do not remove your panel! Your panel should only be maintained by a licensed electrician. But it is smart to look for signs that yours needs to be replaced, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rust.</li>\n<li>Corrosion.</li>\n<li>Evidence of melting.</li>\n<li>Pest damage.</li>\n<li>Poor panel access.</li>\n<li>Nearby water or condensation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these could indicate that you should leave your electrical panel alone and call a professional electrician. The same is true if you hear popping or crackling noises. Moreover, if you feel a tingle or charge when you touch your electrical panel, back away and call a professional.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettinghomeinsurancewitholdelectricalpanels\">Getting home insurance with old electrical panels</h2>\n<p>You may have a difficult time getting even <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">high-risk homeowners insurance</a> if you have an electrical panel that is a known fire hazard. But if you replace the panel with the help of a licensed electrician, your insurance company might decide to offer you a policy. You may need evidence that you have made the change, like a work order or receipt.</p>\n<p>If you know that you have a problematic circuit panel and fail to disclose this to your insurance provider, a fire claim could be denied. It’s best to make sure that you are safe with an upgraded panel and protected in the event of a fire.</p>"

      title: "Report: How Many US Homes Are Underinsured?"
      body: "<p>About 64 percent of homeowners don’t have enough insurance, according to CoreLogic’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.corelogic.com/products/residential-cost-handbook.aspx\" text=\"Residential Cost Handbook\" >}}. Worse, their homes are underinsured by an average of 27 percent. But what does being underinsured really mean? After all, you should be protected if you have insurance, right?</p>\n<p>Unlike someone who is uninsured, an underinsured homeowner has a policy, but the coverage is insufficient. This leaves them with bigger expenses if they ever file a claim. Many times, underinsured homeowners think they have adequate coverage only to find out in a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster</a> that they don’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesunderinsuredmean\">What Does Underinsured Mean?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, being underinsured means you have a policy that only covers a portion of your losses in a claim, often because of exclusions or coverage limits. For example, you might insure your home for $300,000, only to find out that rebuilding it after a total loss costs $400,000. Homeowners who are underinsured may have to pay tens of thousands – maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars –&nbsp;out of their own pockets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifyouareunderinsured\">What Happens if You Are Underinsured?</h3>\n<p>According to Brian Evans, CEO and founder of claims management firm {{< external-link url=\"http://easternpublic.com/\" text=\"Eastern Public\" >}}, “Underinsuring property can be a life-changing mistake for homeowners. This is because <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is often the only resource available to them to recover their home or to respond to a variety of other loss-related expenses.”</p>\n<p>With such big costs at stake, each homeowner needs to fully understand the potential financial impact underinsurance is to their personal situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyhomeownersareunderinsured\">Why Homeowners Are Underinsured</h2>\n<p>With more than half of US homes underinsured, you have to wonder why so many homeowners don’t get enough coverage. What are the biggest reasons for underinsurance in today’s market?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there's no one cause. Underinsurance can be the result of any number of events, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undervaluing your property.</li>\n<li>Misunderstanding what’s covered and what’s not.</li>\n<li>Failing to account for construction costs.</li>\n<li>Failing to report upgrades to your insurer.</li>\n<li>Choosing to not increase sub-limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies can also make mistakes in underwriting or historical data collection that can cause a homeowner to be underinsured. Moreover, sometimes agent negligence is the root of the problem, such as an agent failing to ask the right questions or perform their due diligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7underinsuranceexamplesforhomeowners\">7 Underinsurance Examples for Homeowners</h2>\n<p>There are several ways in which your home can end up being underinsured. Perhaps the most common is when you assume it’s safe from catastrophes. Unfortunately, <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change is putting more homes at risk</a> for major disasters. But underinsurance can also be a problem if homeowners misjudge the value of their personal property or their chances of being sued after an accident. Below are just a few examples of how homeowners end up underinsured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1underestimatingyourriskforcatastrophe\">1. Underestimating Your Risk for Catastrophe</h3>\n<p>Homeowners often assume they aren’t likely to suffer a catastrophic loss, so they’re better off skimping on insurance to save money. It’s hard to blame them, considering how home insurance premiums have risen steadily throughout the country. The most recent report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows rates increased {{< external-link url=\"https://content.naic.org/article/news<em>release</em>naic<em>releases</em>homeowners<em>insurance</em>report.htm_0\" text=\"3.1 percent\" >}} from 2017 to 2018.</p>\n<p>These increased costs may have homeowners weighing the risk versus reward of paying more for insurance on the outside chance they have a catastrophic loss. But the reality is that we’re seeing more losses with bigger price tags, and that means homeowners who think they can cut back on coverage may be in for a world of trouble.</p>\n<h4 id=\"underinsuranceandnaturaldisasters\">Underinsurance and Natural Disasters</h4>\n<p>Let’s start with wildfires. Veridesk’s Wildfire Analysis Report identifies {{< external-link url=\"https://www.verisk.com/insurance/campaigns/location-fireline-state-risk-report/\" text=\"4.5 million U.S. homes\" >}} as being in areas of high or extreme risk for wildfire, with over 2 million located in California. According to Insurance Business America, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/wildfire-victims-are-largely-underinsured-116580.aspx\" text=\"80 percent of homes\" >}} affected by 2018 California wildfires were underinsured. If we assume this percentage is the same for all the homes with high or extreme risk, then 3.6 million homes are underinsured for a wildfire and may not be able to rebuild after a catastrophic loss.</p>\n<p>Of course, wildfires aren’t the only risk that homeowners may be underinsured for. Hail storms, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes can all cause severe damage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that the US saw 22 weather events where losses exceeded $1 billion in 2020. This beats the previous record of 16 (2011 and 2017) and is the sixth year in row where the US sustained 10 or more billion-dollar weather events.</p>\n<p>As the chart below shows, the average cost of billion-dollar disaster events (represented by the black line) has been climbing over the last 20 years. Also note that each of the colored lines, the ones that show the biggest jump in costs, represent recent years (i.e., 2005, 2011, 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2020).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/year-to-date-disasters.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Source: {{< external-link url=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/\" text=\"NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2021)\" >}}. DOI: {{< external-link url=\"https://www.doi.org/10.25921/stkw-7w73\" text=\"10.25921/stkw-7w7\" >}}</em></p>\n<p>Since 1980, the year NOAA started tracking billion-dollar disasters, the US has suffered 285 of them, 41 percent of which occurred between 2010 and 2019. But perhaps the most important number is how many states have had at least one natural disaster that costs more than $1 billion: 50. The map below shows just how many areas were impacted by billion-dollar weather and climate disasters just in 2020.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/billion-dollar-climate-disasters.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Source: {{< external-link url=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/\" text=\"NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2021)\" >}}. DOI: {{< external-link url=\"https://www.doi.org/10.25921/stkw-7w73\" text=\"10.25921/stkw-7w7\" >}}</em></p>\n<p>Storms don’t have to cause billions of dollars in damage to do great financial harm to homeowners, either. According to Evans, “Homeowners insurance policies will often exclude coverage entirely, include separate sub-limits of insurance, or impose higher deductibles for losses resulting from wildfire or hurricane. . . This presents difficult challenges for consumers to navigate when reviewing their policies to ensure they have adequate insurance coverage.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether you think the problem is man-made or natural, climate change is increasing your risk for a number of catastrophes. If you haven’t addressed this in your homeowners insurance, then there’s a good chance that you’re underinsured.</p>\n<h4 id=\"canunderinsuredhomeownersrelyonfederalaidafteradisaster\">Can Underinsured Homeowners Rely on Federal Aid After a Disaster?</h4>\n<p>Homeowners probably shouldn’t rely solely on funds from the <a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster programs</a>. Without a doubt, those funds are necessary after a disaster, but they aren’t alway readily available, and you may receive a prorated amount based on the total assessed loss in your area.</p>\n<p>Long story short? That means you’re competing with your neighbor for assistance grants that may or may not be available by the time FEMA gets to you. Look at Hurricane Katrina as an example. More than a decade later, New Orleans and outlying neighborhoods are still trying to rebuild and get the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/fourteen-years-later-new-orleans-is-still-trying-to-recover-from-hurricane-katrina\" text=\"pre-hurricane population back\" >}}.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2notcheckingconstructioncosts\">2. Not Checking Construction Costs</h3>\n<p>You should always look to insure your home for the amount it will take to rebuild it. However, rising construction costs can cause you to be underinsured if you simply renew your coverage for the same amount every year. Fluctuating costs for materials and labor could mean you don’t have enough coverage, especially if you’ve insured your home for its actual cash value. The depreciated value of your home will be even further away from the amount you’ll need to spend to replace it.</p>\n<p>Construction costs have been climbing fairly steadily for a few years and don’t show any signs of slowing down. The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx\" text=\"most recent data\" >}} from the National Association of Home Builders shows the average cost for building a single-family home is $296,652, or $114 per square foot. Compare that to the average cost in previous years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2011: $80 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2013: $95 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2015: $103 per square foot.</li>\n<li>2017: $86 per square foot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to JLL’s latest H1 2021 Construction Outlook, costs will continue to rise, increasing between 3.5 and 5.5 percent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3undervaluingyourpersonalproperty\">3. Undervaluing Your Personal Property</h3>\n<p>While homeowners are usually most concerned about rebuilding their homes after a claim, they can also face significant costs if they fail to fully insure their personal property (i.e., all the stuff inside your home). Imagine a total loss on a home where the homeowner insured all of their personal property for $20,000. At a minimum, that $20,000 has to pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kitchen appliances.</li>\n<li>Furniture for every room.</li>\n<li>Electronics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That list doesn’t even take into consideration clothing, dishes, cookware, and other home goods that may need replacing.</p>\n<p>Many insurance companies set a default coverage amount for personal property, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a> on your declarations page, that is a percentage of the building replacement value found in <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>. This default coverage can be anywhere between 10 percent to 75 percent of the building replacement value, depending on your insurer.</p>\n<p>However, you’re not stuck with the default amount. You can request personal property coverage of up to 100 percent or more of your home’s replacement value. Doing so can help you get back to normal after a major loss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4underinsuringforliability\">4. Underinsuring for Liability</h3>\n<p>Liability claims are where a homeowner is responsible for someone else’s bodily injury or property damage. This type of claim typically covers events like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your dog biting the mail carrier.</li>\n<li>Your tree falling on the neighbor’s property.</li>\n<li>Swimming pool accidents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between 2014 and 2018, liability claims accounted for {{< external-link url=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\" text=\"1.9 to 4.0 percent\" >}} of all homeowners claims and averaged $26,872 according to a report created by Verisk Analytics and cited by the Insurance Information Institute (III). The III also reports that the average dog bite claim in 2019 {{< external-link url=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-dog-bite-liability\" text=\"paid out $44,760\" >}} with some claims costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. While these averages are covered by the standard $100,000 in personal liability found in most homeowners insurance policies, any outlier claim over this leaves homeowners exposed to additional costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5insuringyourhomesactualcashvalue\">5. Insuring Your Home’s Actual Cash Value</h3>\n<p>When it comes to property coverage, you can insure your property’s <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> or its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. These are two very different ways to insure a home that can dramatically affect the cost and the coverage.</p>\n<p>Actual cash value insures your property based on its depreciated value. Let’s say you insure your home on an actual cash value basis, and you suffer a total loss. Your insurance company is going to look at the value of your home, subtract an amount for depreciation, and pay you that, up to your policy limits. So if your home’s depreciated value is $100,000, but rebuilding it costs $150,000, you’re going to come up short in a claim.</p>\n<p>Instead, homeowners should insure homes for the replacement cost, which is the amount it costs to repair or replace the property without subtracting for depreciation. Insuring for your home’s replacement cost is usually more expensive, but it keeps you from being underinsured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6ignoringsublimits\">6. Ignoring Sub-limits</h3>\n<p>Home insurance policies can have sub-limits, or a set coverage amount for a specific type of loss. For example, a homeowners policy might cap payouts for damaged computer equipment at $1,500, firearms at $2,000, and jewelry at $3,000. If any of these items are damaged in a covered claim, then your insurers only pays up to the sub-limit.</p>\n<p>As Evans points out, failing to take notice of sub-limits can cause homeowners to be underinsured because the total limit of insurance isn’t available in all scenarios. He uses the example of a frozen pipe causing water damage and mold in a $400,000 home. According to Evans, “The insurance policy for the home may provide insurance coverage up to $400,000, but a separate much smaller limit for mold-related expenses often exists.”</p>\n<p>So while the insurance policy covers the home for the full value, it’s actually underinsured for the claim in question. Understanding this before claims arise empowers you to ask more questions about your policy’s sub-limits so you can be more fully protected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7relyingonyourcondosmasterpolicy\">7. Relying on Your Condo’s Master Policy</h3>\n<p>Condominium owners sometimes make the mistake of assuming they have sufficient coverage because part of their fees goes to what’s known as a <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">master policy</a>. This is essentially insurance purchased by the condo association to cover its liability and property damage to the building’s main structure and common areas.</p>\n<p>So let’s say a pipe bursts in your multi-unit building, causing damage in your condo and the building’s entryway. The condo association’s master policy covers damage to the entryway, but pays nothing for your damage, leaving you underinsured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidunderinsurance\">How to Avoid Underinsurance</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners fulfill their mortgage company’s insurance requirement and are done with their policy until it’s time to renew. While your bank may be satisfied, you’re probably better off taking the time to dig a little deeper into your policy. You want to understand what’s covered, what exclusions or limitations exist, and how one policy works to fill gaps of another (i.e., pairing a homeowners policy with a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance policy</a>).</p>\n<p>You’ve already taken the first step by researching what happens when you’re underinsured. The next is to have an honest conversation with your insurance provider. This means asking what a standard policy covers and how you can fill any gaps. It may also mean making sure your provider knows that your home is on the Gulf Coast or that it’s over 100 years old. These details might cause your premium to go up, but getting the right coverage for your situation typically saves you money in the long run.</p>"

      body: "<p>When someone talks about smart technology for your home, your bathroom probably isn’t the first place that pops into your head. But smart bathrooms are here, and you’ll find there are a ton of new technologies that can improve the comfort, convenience, and safety in one of the most important rooms in your house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisasmartbathroom\">What is a smart bathroom?</h2>\n<p>Smart bathrooms are equipped with technology that allows you to customize your bathroom experience. That often means it’s connected to mobile or networked devices that allow you to control your bathroom technology remotely.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, using your smartphone to turn on your shower before you get out of bed, or watching the news in your vanity mirror as you brush your teeth. Some people have even installed chromotherapy showers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsofsmartbathroomtechnology\">Benefits of smart bathroom technology</h2>\n<p>Many homeowners are drawn to smart technology that <a href=\"/blog/smart-home-technology/\">protects their homes</a>. Who doesn’t love the idea of turning on your lights before you get home or double checking your locks when you’re out on the town? The same can be true for smart bathroom technology like voice-activated night lights and touchless faucets and toilets.</p>\n<p>Convenience and comfort can also play a big role. Think personalized temperature settings, cabinets that keep medicines cool, and ventilation systems that automatically respond to humidity levels in your bathroom.</p>\n<p>But for all of the creature comforts and safety features available, smart bathrooms can also be great for your bank account. Many bathroom tech ideas are geared towards reducing water consumption. Plus, smart technology is in high demand and may increase your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/market-value-of-home/\">market value</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofsmartbathroomtechnologies\">Types of smart bathroom technologies</h2>\n<p>Wondering just how you can make your bathroom smarter? Here are some bathroom tech ideas to investigate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"warmingdrawersandracks\">Warming drawers and racks</h3>\n<p>Don’t use a cold towel or robe ever again. Instead, get a smart warming drawer or towel rack that lets you set the temperature and then has your smart system shut it off at the right time. You get towels at the perfect temperature whenever you want them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smarttoilets\">Smart toilets</h3>\n<p>Smart toilets can come with an amazing array of features. For example, you can get smart toilets with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in seat warmers so your bum doesn’t get shocked by a cold seat.</li>\n<li>Automatic lids that raise with the wave of your hand.</li>\n<li>Motion-activated night lights so you can see in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Self-cleaning features to lighten your household duties.</li>\n<li>Overflow detectors that stop you from flushing when there’s a clog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"smartshowers\">Smart showers</h3>\n<p>Smart showers can also have a variety of features. You’ll often find they have technology that allows you to control the temperature, water pressure, and shower duration with a smartphone app or in-shower controls. These features can also improve your shower’s efficiency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"voiceactivatedlighting\">Voice-activated lighting</h3>\n<p>Making your bathroom safer for anyone at risk for falls is enough of a reason to invest in voice-activated lighting. Plus, you can control more than the overhead lights with technology. You can get mirror lights that adjust on command to make it easier to put makeup on properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartmirrors\">Smart mirrors</h3>\n<p>Did you know that your mirror can become an information hub? Mirrors today can be interactive so you can set yours up with the day’s forecast, headlines, and traffic updates. That’s much simpler than trying to get ready while checking your phone or running out to catch the traffic report on your television.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartfaucets\">Smart faucets</h3>\n<p>Like smart showers, smart faucets can help you reduce water waste while also controlling temperature and pressure. You can find faucets that you work via your smartphone or that are activated by voice or motion, as well as one-touch faucets. These usually operate with just a single touch anywhere on the spout or handle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartbathmats\">Smart bath mats</h3>\n<p>Most bath mats do little more than lie on the floor. But smart bath mats can help you stay healthy by measuring your weight, body-mass index, and even your posture. That’s right! You can buy a smart mat that reminds you to stand tall just like your mom did when you were a kid. Some even record your information in a smartphone app and send you exercise suggestions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smartwatersensors\">Smart water sensors</h3>\n<p>While they may not be as showy as some of our other bathroom tech ideas, smart water sensors can save you money should you have a leak. They detect water where there shouldn’t be any and alert you via your smartphone. Some even alert you to high humidity levels or pipes that are in danger of freezing. This gives you time to minimize damage to your home – which means less expensive repairs and easier clean up for you!</p>\n<p>There are a lot of positives to smart bathrooms, but remember that upgrading your technology can impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Some might require additional coverage. Others, like a smart water sensor, may result in a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">premium discount</a>. If you make an upgrade to your home, you may also have to <a href=\"/blog/when-to-update-home-insurance/\">update your homeowners policy</a>.</p>"

      title: "5 reasons you need a smart sprinkler | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>Who would have thought that watering the lawn could be such a hassle? The health and appearance of your yard depends on you knowing how much water to use and when to use it. That’s probably why smart sprinklers are becoming more and more popular among homeowners.</p>\n<p>Not only can a smart sprinkler help you get your lawn in tip-top condition, but it often helps you conserve water by using weather data, soil moisture sensors, and rain gauges to automate your watering schedule. Even better? Most smart sprinklers can be operated remotely so you can water your lawn from anywhere.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at five reasons you may want to invest in a smart sprinkler system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1costsavings\">1. Cost savings</h2>\n<p>Finding ways to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-reduce-energy-bills/\">reduce energy bills</a> can be a challenge for homeowners. Like most smart technology, smart sprinklers are often designed to save you money by lowering your water costs. In fact, the use of smart sprinkler controllers may be able to save you between {{< external-link url=\"https://heroeslawncare.com/\" text=\"30% and 50%\" >}} on monthly water bills.</p>\n<p>Most smart sprinkler systems collect data through moisture sensors and rain gauges. Using that information lets the sprinkler adjust its watering schedule accordingly to use less water.</p>\n<p>There are two other ways smart sprinklers can usually help homeowners save money. First, sprinklers allow for remote operation, so you don't need to hire someone else to water your lawn when you’re away. You can do it from anywhere! Additionally, smart sprinklers require little maintenance, so you won't have to worry about costly repairs down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2waterconservation\">2. Water conservation</h2>\n<p>The only thing better than saving some green is <a href=\"/blog/how-to-go-green-this-winter/\">going green</a>, and smart sprinklers can help with that, too. The technology uses local weather data and soil moisture sensors to determine when and how much water is needed for each area of your lawn. By not over-watering areas with little sunlight or heavy shade, and avoiding watering during rainy days, a smart sprinkler conserves water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3convenience\">3. Convenience</h2>\n<p>Sprinklers can also make it easier to control your lawn's water needs. With a smart sprinkler, you can monitor and adjust the watering schedule remotely with an app or website. If there’s an unexpected change in the weather or you need to make a quick adjustment while you’re running errands, you can water your lawn easily from anywhere.</p>\n<p>How convenient a smart sprinkler system is for you depends a little bit on the type you get. Below are a few examples of the types of what’s currently available on the market:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WiFi-enabled sprinklers.</strong> You can get a smart sprinkler that connects to your home’s WiFi network. These are usually easy to set up, require minimal wiring, and allow you to access the sprinkler system via an app or website.</li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth-enabled sprinklers.</strong> Similar to WiFi-enabled ones, bluetooth-enabled sprinklers can be operated remotely. However, these sprinklers do not require a home WiFi network. Instead, they use bluetooth technology to connect with nearby devices, which makes them great for renters.</li>\n<li><strong>Battery-powered sprinklers.</strong> These sprinklers are powered by batteries, making them great for people who don't have access to a power outlet. Plus, they don't require any wiring or setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4sitespecificcontrol\">4. Site-specific control</h2>\n<p>Another great reason to get one of these high-tech sprinklers is that they allow for site-specific irrigation control. That means each zone of your lawn can be watered separately according to its own needs. For example, areas with heavy shade may require less frequent watering than areas in direct sunlight. Smart sprinklers can help tailor the water usage of each area accordingly, resulting in more efficient watering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5timersandalerts\">5. Timers and alerts</h2>\n<p>Live in an area impacted by drought? Or one that’s suddenly seeing more rain than normal? Either one can be hard on your lawn and hurt the look of your home no matter how creative you get with your <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">curb appeal ideas</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution may be a smart sprinkler with a specific timer for when it should turn on or off as well as an alert function to let you know you’re running low on water. A sprinkler like that can provide your lawn with just the right amount of water they need, so you don’t have to worry if they’re overwatering or underwatering.</p>\n<p>This can improve overall plant health and lower instances of diseases or pests because the sprinkler provides the best possible watering schedule for your plants. Some sprinklers even allow you to create customized watering schedules for each individual plant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Overall, these sprinklers are a great way to conserve water and save money at the same time. So if you're looking for an efficient and convenient way to keep your lawn looking its best, a smart sprinkler may be the way to go.</p>"

      title: "Spring Home Maintenance Ideas for Busy Homeowners"
      body: "<h2 id=\"cleanyourguttersanddownspouts\">Clean Your Gutters and Downspouts</h2>\n<p>Almost every article we write about home maintenance includes a tip for cleaning your gutters. It’s even one of our <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">six tips for preventing flood damage</a>. But there’s a good reason for this. Not only does pulling out the gunk that accumulates over the winter help stop pesky mosquitoes, but it also protects your home’s roof, walls, and foundation.</p>\n<p>You want to clean your gutters and downspouts before the heavy spring rains come. That way you can make sure the system drains properly and pushes water away from your home. Also inspect your gutters and downspouts for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cracks.</li>\n<li>Rust.</li>\n<li>Sagging.</li>\n<li>Water damage.</li>\n<li>Mold.</li>\n<li>Pooling water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These can be signs that your downspouts and gutters need to be replaced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkfortermites\">Check for Termites</h2>\n<p>Warm weather brings out all kinds of animals, and probably the least appreciated of these is termites. Subterranean termites, for example, start swarming in the spring, and that makes them particularly risky for your home.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">home insurance rarely covers termite damage</a>, so you want to find problems before they start. Here are a few signs of a termite infestation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small pinholes in your walls.</li>\n<li>Buckling or crumbling wood.</li>\n<li>Narrow tunnels, called mud tubes.</li>\n<li>Discarded termite wings.</li>\n<li>Peeling paint.</li>\n<li>Stuck doors and windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you aren’t sure if you’ve found an infestation, you may want to hire an exterminator to inspect your property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resealexteriorwood\">Reseal Exterior Wood</h2>\n<p>The wood around your house expands and contracts with the rise and fall of temperatures. This, plus moisture from winter ice and snow, can cause it to weaken, warp, and even rot. To protect against this, take the time to reseal your woodwork, like decks, fences, railings, and trellises.</p>\n<p>Before you buy sealant and get to work, note that you may have some repairs to make. Plus, you’ll want to give the wood a good scrubbing and sand the surface. This helps ensure that wood can absorb the new sealant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspectyourroof\">Inspect Your Roof</h2>\n<p>Winter storms do a number on your roof each year, so one of your most important spring maintenance tasks is to give it a good once-over. This isn’t to suggest that you should climb a ladder and inspect your roof ﹘ leave that to the professionals! But you can grab a pair of binoculars and look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damaged or missing shingles.</li>\n<li>Buckling or curling shingles.</li>\n<li>Mold, moss, and piles of leaves.</li>\n<li>Pooling water.</li>\n<li>Cracks in chimney or skylight seals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you see signs of a problem, get in touch with a roofer who can perform a more thorough inspection. That way, you may avoid a minor problem turning into a major leak in your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checkasphaltandconcretepaths\">Check Asphalt and Concrete Paths</h2>\n<p>Winter weather can also cause asphalt, concrete, and other types of hardscaping materials to crack. That kind of damage is unattractive, but it can also create a tripping hazard for your guests.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the snow melting in the spring usually gives you a better idea of how much damage you have. You may be able to fix small cracks easily enough, but larger patches may require you to patch asphalt or replace concrete paths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testyoursprinklersystem\">Test Your Sprinkler System</h2>\n<p>Spring gets most homeowners thinking about their lawns and gardens, but neither will grow well if your irrigation system isn’t ready. Start by turning on your sprinklers to see what happens. Ideally, water comes out and there are no problems. However, you may find that some sprinkler heads are broken and need to be replaced.</p>\n<p>Once you’re sure the sprinklers are working, you want to check that they’re working in the right way. Adjust the sprinkler heads so they spray your flowers and grass ﹘ not your house, sidewalk, or street. Not only will your plants thank you, but your water bill may too!</p>\n<h2 id=\"examineyourscreens\">Examine Your Screens</h2>\n<p>One of the best parts of spring is opening up your doors and windows to let fresh air flow through the house. But that’s only enjoyable if you can also keep mosquitoes and flies out, so take a good look at the screens on your doors and windows. Fixing no rips and tears in your screens is surprisingly easy, and most home improvement stores have repair kits for under $20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"serviceairconditioner\">Service Air Conditioner</h2>\n<p>While the spring is usually moderate, summer temperatures are on the way. You can prepare for the hot months ahead by getting your air conditioning unit serviced. Technicians can clean your HVAC system to ensure it’s working efficiently. Some <a href=\"/glossary/home-warranty/\">home warranty plans</a> include this annual maintenance, so make use of it to keep your home cool and your electric bills down.</p>"

      title: "Spruce up your home with the color of the year"
      body: "<p>Do your walls seem a little drab? Has it been a while since you updated your decor? If so, then maybe it’s time to shake things up a bit. The easiest way to do that is to introduce a new color to your home, and picking a color of the year ensures that your decor stays on trend.</p>\n<p>Several companies announce a color that they feel best encapsulates the spirit of the time. The best known of these is probably the Pantone color of the year, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023\" text=\"Viva Magenta for 2023\" >}}, but others include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish Moss from Krylon.</li>\n<li>Redend Point from Sherwin-Williams.</li>\n<li>Raspberry Blush from Benjamin Moore.</li>\n<li>Vining Ivy from Glidden.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whichever color is your preference, bringing it into your home doesn’t require a major overhaul. We’ve listed a few simple ways to spruce up your home with the color of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decorativethrowsandpillows\">Decorative throws and pillows</h2>\n<p>Incorporating the color of the year is as easy as buying new pillows and throws. Tossed on a sofa or chairs, a Viva Magenta blanket can give your room the same joy and optimism that Pantone says the color displays. Plus, this option allows you to dip your toe in Pantone's color of the year without making a permanent change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newcurtains\">New curtains</h2>\n<p>Changing out your curtains for the season is a great way to keep a room contemporary and stylish. Even better, it's a simple and straightforward task to accomplish that requires minimal investment. Viva Magenta curtains, however, could dominate a room, so be sure to balance this choice with neutrals that either allow the color to stand out or a combination of warm and cool tones to create a harmonious effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newlampshades\">New lampshades</h2>\n<p>A lot of us don’t think about changing lampshades out when redecorating, but it’s an easy way to bring a little more color to a room that needs it while making an old lamp feel new. The key here is to minimize the change. Think about the type of lighting your lamp is for and choose a shade that keeps the hardware out of sight at eye level. Another option may be to spray paint your old lampshades with Krylon’s paint color of the year, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.krylon.com/en/colors/color-of-the-year\" text=\"Spanish Moss\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"artwork\">Artwork</h2>\n<p>Artwork can be a fun way to get a color of the year incorporated in your decor. Not only do you get to spend a day or two shopping for art, but you can decide just how bold you want to be. Do you want a giant wall hanging that’s all Viva Magenta or something more subtle with {{< external-link url=\"https://www.sherwin-williams.com/content/colorforecast/colormix-2023/color-of-the-year-2023\" text=\"Redend Point\" >}}, Sherwin-Williams’ color of the year, sprinkled throughout? Either can spruce up your home.</p>\n<p>If you’re crafty, you may want to go thrift shopping and use one of the paint colors of the year, like Benjamin Moore’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color-of-the-year-2023#PairingPalette\" text=\"Raspberry Blush\" >}}, to make something special for your home. That’s always a good way to <a href=\"/blog/decorate-your-home-on-a-budget/\">decorate your home on a budget</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accentwall\">Accent wall</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/color-of-the-year-wall.jpg\" alt=\"One living room wall in Viva magenta with a beige sofa and pale floors\" /><p align=\"center\"><i><small>Painting an accent wall the color of the year can make a big impact on the space.</small></i><p></p>\n<p>An accent wall allows you to bring a bold color into your house without overwhelming a room. But of all our tips, this one is likely to require the biggest investment. Think carefully about which wall is the right choice for an accent color. For example, walls without architectural features are usually a good choice while neutrals can make your color of the year wall pop.</p>\n<p>Another consideration is the importance of color on the <a href=\"/blog/psychology-of-interior-design/\">psychology of interior design</a>. A wall in Viva Magenta will have a very different impact on your mood compared to one painted with Glidden’s {{< external-link url=\"https://www.glidden.com/trends\" text=\"Vining Ivy\" >}}.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoincorporatethecoloroftheyear\">How to incorporate the color of the year</h2>\n<p>Bringing one of these colors of the year into your home is just the first step; the next step is to make it work with your color palette. Luckily, there are few simple guidelines that may help.</p>\n<p>First, you may want to consult a color wheel. This is a tool that has all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors arranged by wavelength. Colors directly across from each other are considered complementary while those next to each other are described as analogous. Working within either of these ranges can help you coordinate your color palette.</p>\n<p>However, Viva Magenta may still cause you some trouble because it’s an unconventional and vibrant color from Pantone. Luckily, the company put together a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023#:~:text=Explore%0Athe%20Magentaverse\" text=\"sample color palette\" >}} with light, soft neutrals to help you work Viva Magenta into your interior decor.</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article was originally published in April 2022.

      title: "The Fewer Home Insurance Questions, the Better"
      body: "<p>If you’ve ever applied for home insurance, you’ve probably felt like you were being quizzed on how well you know your home. You may have even encountered questions you weren’t sure how to answer, like “How is your roof attached to your walls?” And if you’re like us, you may have wondered why it has to be that way.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: it doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Though those answers are important, your input isn’t the only way to get them. It’s often more accurate when homeowners <em>aren’t</em> tasked with providing that information.</p>\n<p>We still use the data any insurer needs to determine your risk, coverage, and premium, but we use more than 10,000 data points and scientific validation to reduce the number of questions you have to answer.</p>\n<p>In fact, one of the key results from a third-party competitor analysis revealed how few property detail questions we ask compared to other insurtechs, like Lemonade, Hippo, Branch, and Gabi.</p>\n<p>And just like that, insurance gets so much easier!</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingpropertydatatosimplifyhomeinsurance\">Using Property Data to Simplify Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>Consumers expect a user-friendly digital experience, even with insurance. In a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/technology/chubb-more-than-half-of-home-insurance-consumers-look-for-coverage-online-160492.aspx\" text=\"2019 study\" >}}, 53 percent of participants said that they shopped online for homeowners insurance and 61 percent said that they are likely to shop online for home insurance in the future. But, as an {{< external-link url=\"https://insuranceblog.accenture.com/customers-experience-demands-illustrate-the-importance-of-insurers-going-digital-now\" text=\"Accenture report\" >}} noted, most online insurance experiences are still lacking. Nearly 75 percent of shoppers ran into problems when buying coverage online. Almost a quarter of respondents said the process was too complicated while another 22 percent complained it took too long.</p>\n<p>Home insurance applications don’t have to be so long and confusing. Much of the information that other insurance companies collect manually can be sourced other ways, so we developed technology to gather and evaluate it. Basically, we take the complexity out of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to speeding up and simplifying the buying process, our use of objective external data also increases underwriting and pricing accuracy. While most folks are experts on what makes their house a home – its nooks and crannies, the floorboard that creaks – most would have to guess about <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">the shape of their roof</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewegetpropertydataandhowweuseit\">Where We Get Property Data and How We Use It</h2>\n<p>Unlike many of our competitors who rely on the homeowner or only pull data from one source, we work with dozens of vendors and pull data from public records and real estate listings to ingest thousands of attributes, such as the home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construction.</li>\n<li>Roof type, age, and material.</li>\n<li>Square footage and number of stories.</li>\n<li>Build date.</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Basement type.</li>\n<li>Finish quality.</li>\n<li>Foundation type.</li>\n<li>Number of stories.</li>\n<li>And much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also leverage geospatial data, which helps us understand exposure to catastrophic risk and <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-ida-case-study/\">respond to disasters</a>.</p>\n<p>To help us use all the information we gather, we built a few tools that automate, predict, and analyze it for greater accuracy and efficiency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maestro</strong> is a digital platform that collects, prioritizes, and generates millions of data points from external and internal data sources. It’s the technology we use to prefill data when you apply for a quote from Kin.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinfidence</strong> is the name of our artificial intelligence (AI) that uses the data from Maestro to score our level of confidence in certain data points in near real-time. This helps us speed up the process for customers with significantly less data input.</li>\n<li><strong>Kin Bot</strong> automates repetitive tasks, like reviewing and validating documents to support the data we collect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If for any reason we can’t verify your data with our technology, we bring in our amazing (and human!) Kin team to validate it and further train our models.</p>\n<p>We only use our data and AI to the extent that it reduces bias, increases objectivity, and offers more accurate information about the home. We have never used (and have no plans to use) any biometric data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdataprefilleliminatesextrahomeinsurancequestions\">How Data Prefill Eliminates Extra Home Insurance Questions</h2>\n<p>Much of the data we collect with these tools answers questions we use to determine your home insurance coverage and premium. We’re almost always able to prefill (and not have to ask you about) property details like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Square footage</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms</li>\n<li>Roof shape</li>\n<li>Overall quality</li>\n<li>Number of stories</li>\n<li>Foundation type</li>\n<li>Year built</li>\n<li>Roof material</li>\n<li>Foundation shape</li>\n<li>Exterior wall finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"discoversmarterinsurance\">Discover Smarter Insurance</h2>\n<p>The best way to test our tech? Give it a try! Getting a home insurance quote is an easy way to see our data wizardry in action. Who knows – maybe you’ll save some time and money along the way.</p>"

      title: "History of homeowners insurance in America"
      body: "<p>Today, people take insurance for granted in many ways. They assume insurance companies will be around to cover their losses should the worst case scenario become their unfortunate reality.</p>\n<p>At one point, however, the idea of insurance was unheard of. Pooling risk so anyone impacted by a catastrophe can rebuild their home without being put on the street? How revolutionary! But you might be surprised to learn that the concept of <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-1800-1900-insurance-policies/\">insurance dates back several centuries</a>. We take a look at the insurance industry’s murky beginnings to see how this far-out idea made its way to America.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoriginsofinsurance\">The origins of insurance</h2>\n<p>Insurance existed in one form or another all the way back to ancient times. In the early 1900s, archeologists found artifacts dating back to Hammurabi that contain laws protecting shipper agents from losses caused by natural disasters and relieving them of liability when they were victims of theft.</p>\n<p>Similar archeological discoveries revealed several other instances of early laws that transferred or distributed risk in many nations, including China, India, and Greece as well as the Roman Empire. These laws mainly dealt with protecting the people who shipped cargo from the devastating losses that can happen on sea voyages.</p>\n<p>The desire to protect business from these kinds of losses continued during the medieval period. That’s when the king of Portugal created a fund that’s considered the first documented form of maritime insurance in Europe. It wasn’t until the 1600s that the various lines of insurance started taking shape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeinsurancegotitsstart\">How home insurance got its start</h2>\n<p>The Great Fire of London is regarded as the genesis of modern insurance. Insurance existed in various forms before this, but it lacked the rigor and formality of today’s policies. In the 17th century, each policy only covered one peril (i.e., one thing that could go wrong).</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that during the time <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> originated, homes were primarily made of wood. Wood structures burn easily, which posed a problem. To compound that problem, developers built homes closer and closer together as the population grew, which increased the fire risk. People began to understand the importance of protecting their homes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurancecrossesthepond\">Insurance crosses the pond</h2>\n<p>Fast forward to 1732. Insurance has made its way to Charles Town (modern day Charleston), South Carolina, where the first company to cover fire insurance was founded. It wasn’t until 20 years later that noted insurance entrepreneur Benjamin Franklin popularized the coverage. His company, Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (which is still in business) was formed in 1752. The company was instrumental in helping people prevent fires and setting industry precedents.</p>\n<p>In the next century, insurance took off around the United States. What began as just insuring the home against fire quickly blossomed into a full-fledged, lucrative sector: life (which was originally designed to help widows and children), theft, disability, commercial, and auto insurance, to name a few.</p>\n<p>If insurance had not changed, a modern homeowner would need separate policies for fire insurance, lightning insurance, burglary insurance, and so on. Today, all of these are now covered by a <a href=\"/blog/not-so-basic-home-insurance/\">basic homeowners insurance policy</a>. It wasn’t until 1950 that the first packaged home insurance product was sold.</p>\n<p>Growth continued from there. In 1960, the Boston Plan identified insurance availability issues found in urban areas of Boston and took action to address them. The current National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has its start with the 1968 passing of the National Flood Insurance Act. This is the foundation of all flood insurance policies sold today and sets the standards for private flood insurance. By this time, homeowners were already fully appreciating the benefits of standard homeowners insurance policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedevelopmentofregulations\">The development of regulations</h2>\n<p>At this point in history, insurance was more or less a free-for-all: regulations were basically nonexistent, monopolies were forming, and minority groups were excluded. Carriers charged consumers whatever they wanted for premiums, and were often not able to pay out on claims (like a Ponzi scheme).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the government made gradual regulatory headway in the private insurance sector.</p>\n<p>The Social Security Act of 1935, which guaranteed citizens’ rights to unemployment insurance, and the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which shifted governing authority for the insurance industry to the states, were two of the most notable regulations.</p>\n<p>With this oversight (as well as good old-fashioned constant competition), insurance companies have had to eliminate discriminatory practices, offer more competitive prices, and pay out verifiable claims.</p>\n<p>After looking back at the history of homeowners insurance, we’re even more excited to be able to be a part of the next round of fundamental insurance innovation - a better buying process, more accurate risk pricing, and efforts that help homeowners actively avoid damage to their home.</p>"

      title: "The inspiration behind “Florida, Man”"
      body: "<p>You’ve seen the memes. In fact, you’ve probably taken the Florida Man Birthday Challenge – the one where you enter your birthdate and “<a href=\"/floridaman/\">Florida man</a>” in Google and see what whacky headlines pop up: “Florida Man Strips Naked After Car Crash.” “Florida Man Mistakes Birdbath for Pool.” “Florida Man Sets House on Fire While Scaring Gators Away.”</p>\n<p>Funny, right? There’s a headline for every occasion.</p>\n<p>What often goes unsaid is that while the meme is entertaining, it’s also pretty unfair. The only reason anyone even hears wild stories out of Florida is that the state has good public record laws. Authorities make just about every document created by a public agency available to the media, which is something we should applaud, not ridicule.</p>\n<p>But when the media runs a whacky Florida Man story, they're rewarded with better ratings and more clicks. Which encourages them to find more Florida Man stories. Which bumps their ratings. Which encourages more stories.</p>\n<p>It’s a vicious cycle – and one Florida doesn’t deserve.</p>\n<p>We’ve been here for five years now, so we know just how great Florida is. As far as we’re concerned, the rest of the country can laugh at the memes. We’d rather show who Floridians really are, which is why we made our film “Florida, Man.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"/floridaman/\">Watch it here</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"itsnotalwayssunnyinthesunshinestate\">It’s not always sunny in the Sunshine State</h2>\n<p>Maybe the reason people pick on Florida so much is that they’re jealous. White sand beaches, azure skies, and sun more days than not give haters plenty of reasons to hate, especially if they’re under six feet of snow.</p>\n<p>However, Floridians know that living in the Sunshine State doesn’t mean every day is sunny. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), {{< external-link url=\"https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/\" text=\"40 percent\" >}} of all US hurricanes hit Florida shores.The state also leads the nation in the number of hurricanes making landfall: 120. All of that would be bad enough, but Florida is also the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.weather-us.com/en/florida-usa-climate#climate\" text=\" lightning capital of the US\" >}}. And most Floridians know that where there’s lightning, there’s bound to be hail.</p>\n<p>So, yeah – Florida is beautiful, but it’s not for the faint of heart. Sooner or later, Florida happens to each and every one of its residents. And when it does, they need an insurance company that goes beyond the stereotype to see their side of the story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gethomeinsurancethatgetsyou\">Get home insurance that gets you</h2>\n<p>In the film, Florida Man asks, “Why does this stuff always happen to me?”</p>\n<p>Paradise isn’t out to get you, Florida Man. Some days it just feels like it is. And for those times when lightning sets your home ablaze or hail crashes through your roof – or even when a hurricane blows it all away – you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> that’s got your back.</p>\n<p>That’s where we come in. While more insurance companies {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/05/12/613541.htm\" text=\"cut and run after every storm\" >}}, Kin looks at every Florida homeowner as a family – another reason we’re not going to let anyone make fun of you! – so we’re not going anywhere. Instead, we built an insurance company that can handle the risks that come with living in the Sunshine State by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizing your coverage.</strong> Using <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data</a> helps us better understand what types of risks your home actually faces. That way, we can tailor your coverage accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Providing 5-star customer care.</strong> We treat policyholders like family – only the best for our kin. That’s why we have <a href=\"/reviews/\">thousands of 5-star reviews</a> on Trustpilot and a Net Promoter Score of 85 – more than double the industry average of 42.</li>\n<li><strong>Saving you money.</strong> By selling directly to you and cutting out middlemen, we keep our costs low and pass the savings on to you. Our <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey-2021/\">most recent survey</a> shows Kin customers save $600 on average.</li>\n<li><strong>Making claims easier.</strong> We use aerial imagery, satellite services, and virtual inspections so you can rebuild after a disaster faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we’re trying to say is that Kin is more than just another tech company. We deal in insurance, and our goal is to help people protect their homes and loved ones. When Hurricane Ian hit the Florida coast, our <a href=\"/blog/kinfolk-helping-kinfolk-after-hurricane-ian/\">Kinfolk stepped up to help their customers</a>, communities, and each other. That’s our vision for Kin.</p>\n<p>When it’s time to buy homeowners insurance, go with a company that understands <em>you</em>. Kin knows it’s not Florida Man; it’s just Florida, man.</p>"

      title: "The Nuts And Bolts of Florida Wind Mitigation"
      body: "<p>Wind resistance begins with your home's roof. Here are the components that you should be familiar with if you want your home to qualify for wind mitigation credits that can significantly reduce Florida home insurance premiums.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windmitigationandyourroof\">Wind Mitigation and Your Roof</h2>\n<p>Your roof is more than the top of your home. It ensures your home can withstand strong winds and impact. That's why it is the primary consideration during a <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">windstorm mitigation inspection</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the elements of the roof that play a key role in <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofcovering\">Roof Covering</h3>\n<p>The roof covering is what you see on the outside: asphalt shingles, concrete or clay tiles, metal, built-up or membrane. The strongest roof coverings are concrete or clay tiles and metal. You can save a pretty penny on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> policy if you can demonstrate on the wind mitigation form that your roof has one of those materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofdeck\">Roof Deck</h3>\n<p>The roof covering is installed over the roof deck. The roof deck is the roofing material between the structural components, the trusses and joists, and the insulation/weatherproofing layers of the home. The joists are used in the floor as column support and the trusses for the roof. Just picture the skeleton frame of the house, and that’s essentially the joists and trusses.</p>\n<p>A roof deck is generally made up of steel, concrete, cement or wood. Steel and concrete are the superior materials. When purchasing or building a new home, it’s wise to find out what material the roof deck is made of and how that will affect the overall cost of your homeowners insurance. Insurers tend to look most favorably on masonry homes with concrete slab foundations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roofdeckattachment\">Roof Deck Attachment</h3>\n<p>The roof deck attachment connects the roof deck to the trusses or rafters by various types of plywood and nails. This determines how securely the roof is attached. Ideally, a solid roof deck prevents the roof from blowing off in <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane winds</a>.</p>\n<p>The greater thickness the plywood sheathing, the larger the nails, and the closer together the nails are, the lower the risk of a roof blowing off. Longer nails spaced closely together give the roof the greatest ability to withstand high winds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rooftowallattachments\">Roof-to-Wall Attachments</h3>\n<p>Having the strongest roof-to-wall attachments tends to provide some of the greatest windstorm mitigation credits with your insurance provider. Roof-to-wall attachments measure how securely your roof is attached to the wall and considers which mechanism you are using to provide that support.</p>\n<p>Toenails are the least secure attachment – this is basically a metal plate nailed to the trusses or rafters. The greatest support is double wraps, which involve metal support structures on both sides of a roof's frame.</p>"

      title: "The process of buying a house explained"
      body: "<p>It's a seller's market right now, so if you're shopping for a home, you have to be ready to act fast. The process of buying a house has many moving pieces –&nbsp;and missing any of them could derail your purchase.</p>\n<p>So here's a guide to help you keep all your ducks in a row. Take a look at our home buying process checklist to make sure you’re on track to get your dream home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1determineifyourereadytobuyahome\">1. Determine if you’re ready to buy a home</h2>\n<p>See if buying a house is really the right move. Go over your finances and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are my job and income secure?</strong> You may be rolling in the dough right now, but you need to be at least fairly confident that you can maintain that level of income so you can pay your mortgage and other bills.</li>\n<li><strong>How is my credit?</strong> Check your credit report for items that you need to dispute and get fixed. A good credit score typically gives you more options with lenders.</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have debt to pay down?</strong> Mortgage lenders calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which is all of your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income, to see if it meets their requirements. The less debt you have, the better off you’ll be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, assess your liquid assets.You need to make a down payment, which may mean using your savings, selling assets, and maybe even accessing some of your retirement plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2calculatehowmuchhouseyoucanafford\">2. Calculate how much house you can afford</h2>\n<p>How much house you can afford is really determined by how much you can pay toward your mortgage every month. This isn’t an arbitrary number. In fact, it’s your DTI. Depending on the lender and <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">the type of mortgage</a> you qualify for, you want a maximum of DTI of 43 percent. That’s why paying debt down is so important.</p>\n<p>Lenders call this the back-end ratio. While it includes your mortgage and other housing expenses, it also looks at other debts like credit card bills, car payments, or child support. For the portion that’s dedicated to housing, called the front-end ratio, lenders prefer a DTI below 28 percent. That’s $280 for every $1,000 you make.</p>\n<p>The ultimate decision of <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">how much house you can afford</a> depends on your lender, but you can get a sense by running the numbers on your own or using an online mortgage calculator. Plugging your information into a mortgage calculator gives you an estimate of what you’ll pay per month based on current interest rates and the total cost of the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3savemoneyforyourdownpaymentandclosingcosts\">3. Save money for your down payment and closing costs</h2>\n<p>The price of the home you want is just the start of expenses in the process of buying a home. You also need money for closing costs, including a down payment on the home. There are a few loan programs out there that require <a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">zero down payment</a>, but most require at least a three percent down payment. Many conventional lenders expect 20 percent down.</p>\n<p>The down payment is only one closing cost. At closing, you may also have to pay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appraisal fees.</li>\n<li>Loan origination fees.</li>\n<li>Title insurance.</li>\n<li>Property taxes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closing costs can run between two and five percent of the total purchase price of the home. While you can roll some of these costs into the loan itself, you need to plan for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4getpreapprovedforamortgage\">4. Get pre-approved for a mortgage</h2>\n<p>While there’s nothing to stop you from shopping for a home without pre-approval, you may be setting yourself up for heartache. More than one buyer has been disappointed when they learned they couldn’t get a loan for a house they fell in love with. Your better option is to get a lender to look at your financial situation, underwrite the loan, and send you a pre-approval letter so you know exactly how much money you have to work with.</p>\n<p>The pre-approval letter will list the amount you qualify for at a predetermined interest rate. However, it’s only good for a certain period and subject to change based on income changes, interest rate changes, and debt considerations. If your personal situation takes a dramatic turn, you could lose your pre-approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5choosetherightrealtorforyou\">5. Choose the right realtor for you</h2>\n<p>The realtor’s job is to balance your biggest wants with your actual needs. Few people can afford a home that checks every box, but a good realtor helps you prioritize what your home must have and find you something within your budget.</p>\n<p>You want a realtor who specializes in the buyer’s side of the transaction, as opposed to someone who works both sides of the deal. This ensures your realtor has your best interests at heart and that they can assist you through every step of the purchase and escrow. Remember, when you finally find a house and open escrow, the realtor must help you meet deadlines to avoid costly mistakes. Bottom line? Hire a pro.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6gohousehunting\">6. Go house hunting</h2>\n<p>You’ve reviewed your finances, gotten pre-approved for a mortgage, and contacted a realtor. Now it’s time for the fun stuff: house hunting! Your realtor will likely take you on a tour of available houses. Not only does this help them understand your likes and dislikes, it also gives you a clearer picture of what matters most to you.</p>\n<p>Attending open houses and searching online housing sites such as Zillow or Redfin help with this, too. Just remember to focus on homes that fit your budget and meet your highest priorities so you know how one affects the other. For example, say you want five bedrooms so you and your three children can each have their own rooms while still having space for guests. Your search may reveal that’s unrealistic for your budget.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">22 Questions to Ask When Buying a House</a>.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"7makeanoffer\">7. Make an offer</h2>\n<p>This is the point in the process of buying a house where your realtor can really shine because they understand the market and how to negotiate for the best price. For slow markets, you might be able to make an offer at the asking price or even less. When there aren’t a lot of buyers for a property, you have more control. On the flip side, you might need to offer more than the asking price to compete with other offers if the housing market is hot.</p>\n<p>Whatever your offer is, you have to submit it to the seller in an offer letter. Key components of your offer letter are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name and current address.</li>\n<li>The price you’re willing to pay for the house.</li>\n<li>A deadline for the seller to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Offer letters usually include earnest money to show your serious about buying the house. Your realtor can help you decide how much earnest money to put down, but one to two percent of the purchase price is typical.</p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to decide what your max offer is so you know when to walk away from a property. Because negotiations may not go your way, hold off on planning any renovations until you are certain you have the house at the close of escrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8getahomeinspection\">8. Get a home inspection</h2>\n<p>Once your offer is accepted, you have the right to schedule an <a href=\"/blog/when-to-walk-away-after-a-home-inspection/\">inspection of the house</a>. You want to do this as soon as possible because you usually have limited number days based on the escrow contract.</p>\n<p>The inspector will evaluate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the home systems.</li>\n<li>The home’s structural components.</li>\n<li>Appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the inspector has assessed the home, they will give you a report with the findings. The report will include current problems, but the inspector might also list situations that could cause costly problems for you in the future. For major issues, like problems with the plumbing or foundation, people often get a secondary inspection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9askforrepairsandcredits\">9. Ask for repairs and credits</h2>\n<p>If the inspection reveals any major issues, you can ask the seller for repairs or credits. When you request repairs, you’re asking the homeowner to fix something before the sale is complete. For example, if the inspector found a leak in the bathroom tub, you can ask the seller to hire a plumber to fix it.</p>\n<p>Asking for credits means you want the seller to reduce the purchase price so you can afford to fix the problem on your own. For example, the owner may not be able to repair the roof during escrow, so they give you a $1,000 credit so you can fix it after the purchase is complete. The credit reduces the cost of the house.</p>\n<p>The seller may not accept your request, which means you’ll have to decide how to proceed. You should be able to walk away from the sale if you have an inspection contingency in your offer letter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10getanappraisal\">10. Get an appraisal</h2>\n<p>If you have a loan, you’ll definitely need to have the property appraised. An appraisal tells you the current market value of the home. If it shows a value that’s less than the loan, the lender could deny you or ask you to come up with additional cash to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>This also means you may need to renegotiate the price with the seller. You have the right to walk away from the property if the appraisal is not satisfactory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11haveafinalwalkthrough\">11. Have a final walkthrough</h2>\n<p>Once all inspections and the appraisal are complete, you’re near the end of escrow and the home is almost yours. This is the time to schedule a final walkthrough of the property to make sure that the owner has left it in the expected sale condition. Go through the house room by room to see if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s clean.</li>\n<li>Repairs have been made.</li>\n<li>The seller has cleared out the property.</li>\n<li>There are no new issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If something isn’t right, be sure to have your realtor bring it to the seller’s attention immediately. Don’t close escrow until every detail has been addressed. For example, don’t assume that the seller will be out of the house on the day you get the keys if their furniture is still in the house at the final walkthrough. You want a clean canvas to look at during the final walkthrough so you don’t have any surprises once you take ownership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"12closeescrowandgetthekeys\">12. Close escrow and get the keys</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! The day has finally come, and you’re a homeowner! All you have to do is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign the final paperwork.</li>\n<li>Pay the closing costs if needed.</li>\n<li>Get the keys to your new home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This definitely sounds like the simplest step in the process of buying a home, but give yourself at least an hour to sign all the paperwork. There is a lot of it, and you don’t want to feel rushed when making the biggest purchase of your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"13setyourmoveindate\">13. Set your move-in date</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the keys, you can move in at any time. But you may want to get some home repairs or renovations done while your home is empty. Painting or redoing a bathroom is easier before all your stuff is in the house. Once you have things in order, you can move in!</p>"

      body: "<p>As a homebuyer, one of the hundred decisions you have to make is whether or not you want to buy where there’s a homeowners association (HOA), but that’s hard to do if you’ve never lived with an HOA’s rules and regulations before. We take a closer look at the pros and cons of an HOA to help you make the right choice for you and your family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomeownersassociation\">What Is a Homeowners Association?</h2>\n<p>A homeowners association is an organization that works to protect property values of its members. It does this by enforcing rules and bylaws and collecting <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-fees/\">HOA fees</a> that it then uses to pay for the community’s upkeep and amenities. For instance, an HOA might pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Garbage pickup.</li>\n<li>Lawn care.</li>\n<li>Swimming pool maintenance.</li>\n<li>Professional security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HOAs are often run by volunteer homeowners from the community. However, you may find some hire professionals for specific positions, such as financial managers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofanhoa\">The Benefits of an HOA</h2>\n<p>There are definitely some pluses to buying a home or condo where there’s an HOA. For example, you might find your HOA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offers fun amenities.</strong> Communities with HOAs often come with some very nice extras that homeowners may not be able to afford on their own, like pools and recreation centers. Some may offer party areas that you can reserve for family gatherings, barbecues, and parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Takes care of maintenance and repairs.</strong> Your HOA fees typically go to community upkeep for common areas, which can mean routine maintenance, like landscaping, or sudden repairs, like replacing the shingles to a clubhouse after a storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Covers the community’s utilities and city services. Depending on your situation, your HOA fees may also go towards some of the community’s utility bills, including gas, electricity, and water. City services, like snow removal, can also be covered.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Protects your property’s value.</strong> Most HOAs have rules that encourage homeowners to keep their property looking nice, like requiring homeowners to keep their lawns mowed and their homes in good repair. These rules generally help keep property values up because they make the area attractive to potential buyers.</li>\n<li><strong>Helps with conflicts.</strong> Sometimes the rules are enough to minimize conflict in the community. But when they aren’t, HOAs usually have a system for mediating disputes between neighbors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your HOA usually takes care of insuring all the common areas. However, you still need <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> or <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> for your home or unit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consofanhoa\">Cons of an HOA</h2>\n<p>For some, the benefits of an HOA are outweighed by the drawbacks. The cons of living with an HOA include the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost.</strong> Being part of an HOA does add to your monthly bills. Some HOA fees are minimal, maybe costing you an extra $50 per month, but others might cost several hundred dollars.</li>\n<li><strong>Rules.</strong> Joining an HOA means you agree to follow the rules, which can range anywhere from the color you can paint your front door to the number of people who can live in your house. You might find these rules frustrating, but ignoring them may result in fines.</li>\n<li><strong>Politics.</strong> Your HOA is likely run by neighbors who’ve been elected to its board of directors. While that can mean the people in charge have a good handle on what the community needs, it can also cause problems when the board has to weigh what’s best for the neighborhood against an individual’s preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"questiontoaskbeforejoininganhoa\">Question to Ask Before Joining an HOA</h2>\n<p>Before you buy in a community with an HOA, you want to make sure that you understand what you’re getting into. You need to know how much you’ll pay in HOA fees and what sort of services and amenities you get for that extra cost. Plus, you want to get an idea of whether or not the community is a good fit. Some key questions to ask include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I have a copy of the HOA’s bylaws?</li>\n<li>How much are the HOA fees and what do they cover?</li>\n<li>When was the last time the board increased the HOA fee?</li>\n<li>How often are there special assessments?</li>\n<li>What was the most recent special assessment for?</li>\n<li>Is the board planning any major projects in the near future?</li>\n<li>How much does the HOA hold in reserve?</li>\n<li>What isn’t covered under the HOA’s insurance policy?</li>\n<li>Do the amenities fit my lifestyle? Will I get my money’s worth?</li>\n<li>Is the property a good investment?</li>\n<li>Do the rules restrict the type or number of pets I can have?</li>\n<li>Can I rent the property to others?</li>\n<li>Is this an age restricted community?</li>\n<li>What are the rules regarding solar panels, satellite dishes, flags, fences, and patios?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not a complete list of all the <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">questions to ask when buying a house</a>, but it should give you a good idea of issues you need to cover before you join an HOA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canyourefusetojoinahomeownersassociation\">Can You Refuse to Join a Homeowners Association?</h2>\n<p>HOAs are almost always mandatory. Otherwise, they’d have no way to enforce their rules and regulations. So the only way to avoid joining an HOA is to buy a home where there isn’t one.</p>"

      body: "<p>Credit cards are hard to pay off, and if you’re like most of the US population, you probably have some credit debt to your name.</p>\n<p>In fact, the typical American has four credit cards and an average credit card balance of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/12/credit-card-debt-average-balance-hits-6-200-and-limit-31-000/4722897002/\">nearly $6,200</a>. That’s about 20 percent more credit card debt than a decade ago.

Try the Debt Snowball Method</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouneedalittlemomentum\">Best If: You Need a Little Momentum</h3>\n<p>The debt snowball method is a budgeting and debt repayment method where you pay off the smallest debts first. The idea is that you gain momentum and feel good about getting something to a zero balance before focusing on the next larger debt.</p>\n<p>In this method, you pay the minimum required payment on all credit cards except the one with the smallest balance. You pay down that one with both principal and interest payments.</p>\n<p>This method was made popular by Dave Ramsey, but <a href=\"https://www.debt.org/advice/debt-snowball-method-how-it-works/\">Debt.org</a> notes you may pay more in the long run if you use this budgeting method. That’s because you may be making minimum payments on cards that generate the most interest.</p>\n<p>Let’s do the math: if two cards have the same APR of 20 percent, the one with the bigger balance is costing you more in interest. Assume you are paying off the $1,000 balance versus the $10,000. The smaller card has $212.50 in yearly interest while the larger one is costing you $2,215 in interest every year.</p>\n<p>That said, this method is praised for its psychological advantage: it feels good to pay a balance off. That can help inspire folks to tackle the bigger debts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2usethedebtavalanchemethod\">2. Use the Debt Avalanche Method</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouhavehighinterestcreditcards\">Best If: You Have High-Interest Credit Cards</h3>\n<p>The concept is simple: pay off the most expensive debts first. The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp\">debt avalanche method</a> prioritizes paying off the credit card with the highest interest rate regardless of its balance. Once that card is paid off, you focus your efforts on the next debt with the highest interest.</p>\n<p>Unlike the debt snowball method that pays the smallest debt first, the debt avalanche makes minimum payments on all cards except the one with the highest interest rate. You’ll pay the interest plus principal on this card every month until it’s paid off.</p>\n<p>This is the right route for you if you have high interest rates that are eating up your minimum payments each month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3transferyourbalance\">3. Transfer Your Balance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyoucanpayoffthedebtduringthezerointerestpromotionalperiod\">Best If: You Can Pay Off the Debt During the Zero-Interest Promotional Period</h3>\n<p>One way to pay down credit card debt is to get the balances transferred to a new card with a lower interest rate. Many cards have an introductory zero interest rate, usually for a year, when you transfer your balance. This means every payment goes toward the principal balance until the APR kicks in.</p>\n<p>For this method to work, don’t use the original card anymore. If you have more than one card, continue to pay monthly minimum payments while you pay down the card with zero interest.</p>\n<p>Before you transfer a balance to a new credit card, check transfer fees and the APR once the promotional period ends. This option often only makes sense if you can pay off the balance during the promotional period.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have $10,000 in credit card debt that you are transferring over to a zero-interest promotional card, there may be a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/balance-transfer-3\">3 percent to 5 percent transfer fee</a>. This could add up to $500 to your total debt just by transferring the balance. Make sure you’re aware of all fees and costs before transferring your balance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4applyforahomeequitylineofcredit\">4. Apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouwanttoconsolidatehighinterestdebt\">Best If: You Want to Consolidate High-Interest Debt</h3>\n<p>One method to get rid of credit card debt is to transfer the balance to a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/home-equity-to-consolidate-debt\">home equity line of credit</a>. This method requires discipline: you don’t want to overspend when you have access to a large line of credit. The process is simple: use the checks provided by the credit line to pay off your existing credit card balances.</p>\n<p>Home equity lines of credit typically have interest rates much lower than credit cards, which decreases the cost of the debt. Another advantage is that they charge simple interest rather than compound interest. This reduces the amount of interest you pay over time.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these rates are usually variable and can go up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5exploreacashoutrefinance\">5. Explore a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"bestifyouhaveenoughequitytocoverthedebt\">Best If: You Have Enough Equity to Cover the Debt</h3>\n<p>If you are planning to refinance your mortgage to take advantage of historically low interest rates, you may want to consider rolling your <a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/34032\">credit card debt into the refinance</a>. You’ll need to have enough equity in your home to account for the new debt, but this option helps you to stop paying 15 percent interest rates – and you even get a tax deduction on interest payments.</p>\n<p>Talk to your lender about consolidating your debt into your refinance. They’ll obtain copies of the credit card debt and run a detailed analysis of when your break-even point will be. When the loan funds, the lender will send a check to the credit card company to pay it off. While you are in escrow, you’ll want to continue to make minimum payments on the debt.</p>\n<p>One of the good things about consolidation is you only have one bill to pay monthly. But be sure to maintain discipline with the credit cards and not rack up a bunch of new debt when you see the balances at zero.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteonbudgetingfordebtpayments\">A Note on Budgeting for Debt Payments</h2>\n<p>No matter what method of paying down credit card debt you choose, <a href=\"/blog/best-budgeting-apps/\">you’ll need a budget</a> that allows you to make payments beyond the monthly minimum. Most budget systems work on the 50/20/30 budget model: 50 percent for needs, 30 percent for discretionary spending, and 20 percent for savings and debts.</p>\n<p>Factor this 20 percent into your budget to make sure you have enough money every month to pay toward the principal in addition to the interest. Start thinking about debt as a numbers game that you will win at.</p>\n<p>Write your debts down. Include the balance and the interest rate so you can clearly see what each credit card balance is costing you. From there, choose one of the methods above so you can pay the debt off and start living a debt-free life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforpayingoffcreditcardsinfull\">Tips for Paying Off Credit Cards in Full</h2>\n<p>Accumulating debt can happen in a matter of minutes, but paying it off often requires months, if not years, of discipline. Regardless of what method you choose to pay off your debt, use these tools as a starting point and remember to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stick to the plan.</strong> Consistently paying down your balance is the only way to pay off your debt in a timely way.</li>\n<li><strong>Freeze your credit cards while you pay them off.</strong> This prevents you from using them and adding to your balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Put windfalls to work.</strong> Got a big tax return? A stipend? Sold some collectibles on eBay? Put that unexpected cash toward your debt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that credit history – how long you’ve had your credit cards – is a positive indicator for credit scores. This means you might not want to cancel your cards altogether after you pay them off.</p>\n<p>Paying down debt will have a positive <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">impact on your credit score</a> – and in some states, that can lead to lower home insurance premiums.</p>"

      title: "Types of houses: What style is your home?"
      body: "<p>As a first-time home buyer, you’re probably paying closer attention to types of houses and styles of architecture than you ever have before. The dizzying array of possibilities, inevitably described by industry-specific lingo, can leave a novice scratching their head.</p>\n<p>No one expects you to be an expert, but understanding the terminology can help you better explain what you’re looking for to your real estate agent. That can save you time and energy while <a href=\"/blog/questions-to-ask-before-buying-a-house/\">buying your dream home</a>. Before you start talking about the style of the home, let’s first lock in on the types of houses you can purchase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofhousestructures\">Types of house structures</h2>\n<p>When your real estate agent asks what type of house you’re interested in, they’re most likely trying to figure out what you’re looking for in terms of the physical structure. Do you want a home designed for just one family residence or does a multi-family home appeal to you? Are you okay in a structure where other people are just on the other side of each wall or do you want a standalone home?</p>\n<p>Each type of house has unique features that appeal to different situations. Below is a list of six common structure types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"singlefamilydetachedhouse\">Single-family detached house</h3>\n<p>You probably already know single-family detached homes as standalone houses. These structures do not share a wall with any other residential or commercial space. Normally, a single-family detached home has space on all sides and a garage located somewhere on the property – either attached to the home or detached. A single-family home is designed to house one family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multifamilyhome\">Multi-family home</h3>\n<p>Multi-family homes are single buildings that can house more than one family so that each residence shares walls, ceilings, and floors. Duplexes, apartment buildings, and townhouses are good examples of multi-family. A multi-family home could even be a detached home with a secondary living space, such as a finished basement or loft above the garage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"townhouseorrowhouse\">Townhouse or row house</h3>\n<p>A townhouse or row house is a structure where neighbors again share walls. However, a townhouse usually has multiple floors, its own entrance to the street, and sits on land that belongs to the homeowner. They’re usually designed to be part of a community, so you’ll often find several townhomes lined up in a row or along a square. In many places, “townhouse” and “row house” are synonymous, but some only use row house to describe these attached structures when the outside of each residence looks the same as all the others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"condominium\">Condominium</h3>\n<p>As far as the structure is concerned, a condominium can resemble a single-family home, a townhouse, or an apartment complex. What sets this type of house apart is its ownership. Condo owners own the walls of their residence and the space between them, but they don’t own the land that it sits on or any common areas that may also be part of the complex. This is true even when the condo is built as a townhome, single-family detached, or multi-family structure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manufacturedmobilehome\">Manufactured / Mobile home</h3>\n<p>A manufactured home, also known as a <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home</a>, is a structure that’s built in a factory on a chassis so it can be moved to a plot of land. Like a single-family detached home, a mobile home is free standing, meaning it doesn’t share walls with other residences. However, mobile homes are not built on a foundation, and owners often have to rent the land they live on. Mobile homes are a cost-effective way for people to afford a house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commercialproperty\">Commercial property</h3>\n<p>Commercial property is real estate that’s used for business purposes, including office buildings, warehouses, and large residential rental properties. There are some instances where a commercial building is zoned as a multi-use building, meaning it has both commercial spaces and residential spaces. The residential spaces are usually located above the commercial space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofhousestyles\">Types of house styles</h2>\n<p>On top of asking about the structure of your dream home, your real estate agent will also want to know what type of house styles appeal to you. Style is the architectural design of the home and may be local to your community or state. For example, Massachusetts is known for Cape Cods while California is known for Spanish-style homes.</p>\n<p>The type of house styles that are popular in your state depends on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Climate:</strong> Sub-tropical Florida is an excellent example of how climate can impact house styles. Ranch-style homes are popular in the Sunshine State in part because hot air rises making it expensive to air condition a second floor.</li>\n<li><strong>Available building materials:</strong> Some building materials are less available in certain regions, so homes are less likely to be made of them. “In the Pacific Northwest, brick is uncommon because the material for making brick is not found there,” according to John A. Kilpatrick of {{< external-link url=\"http://www.greenfieldadvisors.com\" text=\"Greenfield Advisors\" >}}. “However, the clay for brick is common in the southeast, where hardwood and cedar are not common. Hence, in Washington and Oregon you see lots of cedar homes, and in the southeast you see a lot of brick ranch style homes.”</li>\n<li><strong>Local history:</strong> As Europeans burned a path across North America, some set up shop in different parts of the continent. Thomas Jepsen of {{< external-link url=\"https://passionplans.com\" text=\"Passion Plans\" >}}, for example, says: “In Florida, where a lot of settlers were Spanish, the Mediterranean and Victorian looks are more prevalent.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just as a heads up, there’s going to be a lot of talk about roofs in the upcoming sections. You might want to check out “<a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">What’s In a Roof</a>” before reading about the various types of house styles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cottage\">Cottage</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cottage-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Cottage style homes are often on the small side﹘typically one story﹘but thought of as cozy and charming. Common features of a cottage include shingled or stucco walls, small porches, bay windows, and a gable roof. Though small, cottage-style homes are well designed and known to have an efficient footprint. They can be found anywhere, but are most popular in the northeastern United States.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mediterranean\">Mediterranean</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/mediterranean-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Mediterranean homes are popular in California and Florida because of the influence of Spanish colonizers in these regions. These homes typically have a courtyard that incorporates indoor and outdoor living and maximizes air circulation throughout the house﹘perfect for warmer climates. Other notable features include white stucco walls mixed with warm wood and stone accents, tiled roofs, and arched doorways and windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ranch\">Ranch</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/ranch-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a spacious, one-story home, the ranch style may be suitable for you. Ranch-style homes usually have open floor plans, low-pitched roofs, and attached garages, but the style has been modified to meet the demands in certain locations. For example, California ranch homes are often L- or U-shaped with sliding glass doors to encourage indoor/outdoor living. Raised ranches, on the other hand, sit up on a foundation and are often found in areas where clay in the soil causes drainage problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"colonial\">Colonial</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/colonial-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The general structure of colonial style homes is simple and symmetrical. These two- or three-story rectangles boast ample space with grand entryways, central staircases, and wood shingles on a shallow gable roof. There are several variations, often depending on where a colonial home is found. We’ve listed a few examples below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dutch Colonial.</strong> You can usually identify a Dutch Colonial by it’s gambrel roof. Also called a barn roof, these double-pitched roofs start out with a relatively wide, flat slope that then takes a sharp downward turn. Dutch Colonials are often found in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</li>\n<li><strong>French Colonial.</strong> Popular in many parts of Louisiana, French Colonial homes have either steep hipped roofs or side-gabled roofs. Other prevalent features include large wraparound porches with columns, French doors, and shuttered windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Spanish Colonial.</strong> Spanish Colonials, typically found in Florida and the Southwest, are designed for hot weather. Their thick stucco walls capture heat that then warms the house as temperatures cool in the evening. The windows of a Spanish Colonial house are small, but usually only covered with wrought iron to allow breezes in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"frenchcountry\">French country</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/french-country-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The French country home typically has a natural stone facade;, tall, multi-paned windows; and either a hip- or mansard-style roof. Another notable feature is the roofing material: clay, barrel-shaped, overlapping tiles. The interior often has two stone fireplaces, one for each side of the house, and distressed wood accents throughout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"midcenturymodern\">Mid-century modern</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/mid-century-modern-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The end of World War II generated a new, forward-looking style for people looking to integrate with nature. Mid-century modern homes are sleek with flat roofs and angular features. Most also offer multiple ceiling-to-floor windows to encourage interaction with the outdoors, plus a mix of natural (often organic) and man-made materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tudor\">Tudor</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/tudor-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Tudor homes became popular throughout the US in the 1920s and are probably most recognizable by their first floor brick exteriors combined with a second floor made of stucco with decorative timber. These homes usually have steep gable roofs, asymmetrical floor plans, and tall leaded windows with multiple panes set in a diamond pattern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"victorian\">Victorian</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/victorian-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Introduced to the U.S. in the late 1830s, Victorian homes are often two to three stories and very ornate, with plenty of decorative trim, vivid colors, and an asymmetrical shape that creates several rooflines. Some even have rounded rooms resembling a castle tower. Other standout features include wraparound porches and large bay windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craftsman\">Craftsman</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/craftsman-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A craftsman home highlights its maker’s skills through large overhangs, exposed rafters and beams on the exterior, and sash windows. These small and medium-sized homes usually have a low-pitched gable roof, open front porch with tapered columns, and large picture window. While the original craftsman homes had closed off interiors to distinguish one room from another, modern versions can have open floor plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contemporary\">Contemporary</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/contemporary-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Contemporary homes incorporate elements of the modern style with a green twist. They use eco-friendly materials in a sleek design that uses glass to make spaces seem bigger than they are. Lines are strong and roofs flat, evoking a minimalist feel. And while many harken back to the angular features found in mid-century modern homes, some use free-form lines that echo shapes found in nature and create a feeling of movement.</p>\n<p>Contemporary styles can certainly adapt to their communities. Realtor Shelton Wilder of {{< external-link url=\"https://sheltonwilder.com/\" text=\"The Shelton Wilder Group\" >}} says that Los Angeles sees “a lot of new construction and remodels embracing the year-round warm weather with an emphasis on indoor/outdoor living.” That might translate to large walls with floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading to a patio or side yard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"capecod\">Cape Cod</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/cape-cod-house.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Cape Cod homes have a longstanding history in the US featured throughout New England communities. The standout feature of these symmetrical dwellings is the centralized chimney, but they’re also known for their steep roofs and gabled dormers. Traditional Cape Cods have shingle wood siding, but newer versions may be made of brick or stucco.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebesttypeofhousetobuy\">The best type of house to buy</h2>\n<p>Choosing the best style house for you depends on a lot of factors. Cost, of course, is a major one. Some types of house styles are mostly found in places where real estate is expensive, so that drives up the average cost. Similarly, you may end up paying more if a particular style is rare in your area.</p>\n<p>But you also want to think about what type of house fits your needs and preferences. You certainly don’t want to get a townhouse if you hate climbing stairs or want a little space between you and your neighbors. However, if you’re hoping to earn rental income to pay off your mortgage, then a multi-family home is a good choice.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should love how the house looks. Let’s say you find a colonial home that has the space you need, but you can’t stand its boxy shape ﹘ walk away! You’re spending too much money to live in a home you hate.</p>\n<p>Tell your realtor the types of house styles that you’re most attracted to and have them search the market for homes that fit the bill. Chances are that you’ll find a wide range of prices, but with the right amount of patience and persistence, you’ll find the perfect place to call home.</p>"

      title: "Ultimate Spring Gardening Checklist"
      body: "<p>Gardeners know that if you want to lush plants and vibrant flowers in the summer, you’ve got to get organized in the spring. Take a look at our spring gardening checklist for simple tasks to get you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1cleanupdebris\">1. Clean Up Debris</h2>\n<p>The first step is to remove dead leaves and branches that may have accumulated in your garden during the winter months. You also want to toss out any mulch you used on your perennials. While all this debris protected your plants from the cold, it now needs to be cleared out so the sun can do its magic. Much of what you clean up can go on your compost pile if you’re into <a href=\"/blog/sustainable-gardening-ideas/\">sustainable gardening</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2removewinterprotection\">2. Remove Winter Protection</h2>\n<p>Now is the time to take off any winter protection, such as burlap barriers or wraps. The plants no longer need the defense and will be hindered by the protection as they try to bloom in the spring and summer. You can also remove any staking on trees that have been in the ground for more than a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3weedflowerbeds\">3. Weed Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>You may have some leftover weeds from the previous season, and new ones probably sprouted as the weather warmed. The best time to pull weeds is early spring, when the ground is softer than summer's hard, dry soil, but the best tip is to get to them before they grow. Otherwise, you may have a tough time getting the entire root.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4inspectyourtrees\">4. Inspect Your Trees</h2>\n<p>Winter can be hard on trees, so take a close look at yours and remove dead wood and storm-damaged branches. Not only does this make your trees more attractive, but it’s also a good move for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> because it reduces the chance for branches to cause damage in a windstorm.</p>\n<p>You also want to examine the tips for discoloration. This could be dieback, a condition where trees die from the tip of their leaves backwards. When you see it, snip the tips off to encourage new growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5pruneyourshrubs\">5. Prune Your Shrubs</h2>\n<p>Shrubs that bloom in the late summer and early fall typically need to be pruned in the spring. Pruning simply means removing part of a plant to encourage and manage growth. Common parts to prune include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dead, dying, and diseased branches.</li>\n<li>Awkwardly growing branches, such as branches that grow down rather than up.</li>\n<li>Shoots growing from the trunk of a tree or the base of a shrub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good pruning is key to healthy, beautiful plants, but remember the rule here is “less is more.” Be careful not to snip new buds that may flower. Another good rule? Wait until you see flowers on spring-blooming plants before you prune them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6fertilizeyourflowerbeds\">6. Fertilize Your Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>Once you’re certain that you won’t see frost and cold weather again, you can apply fertilizer to get your soil in the best possible condition for new plants. Natural, organic fertilizers are usually the best way to go because {{< external-link url=\"https://www.milorganite.com/lawn-care/organic-lawn-care/organic-vs-synthetic\" text=\"synthetics may harm your soil\" >}} over time. Beyond that, you need to choose a fertilizer that suits your plants and soil.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7divideyourperennials\">7. Divide Your Perennials</h2>\n<p>As perennials return, you want to give their roots more space to get the nutrients they need. You can do this by dividing them into multiple plants before new growth begins. Replant the perennials you split off and water liberally to help them re-root in their new home. However, you only want to do this with perennials that bloom later in the seasons. If you already see buds or flowers, It’s best to wait until the fall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8edgeyourflowerbeds\">8. Edge Your Flower Beds</h2>\n<p>Edging is when you create a border between your flower beds and other areas, most commonly your lawn. Doing this makes your garden look neat and tidy, but it also helps to create a lip that holds mulch in place and may even keep weeds at bay.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps if you’ve never edged a flower bed before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline where you want your border with a string, garden hose, or spray paint.</li>\n<li>Cut along that border with a sharp edging tool, like a spade.</li>\n<li>Remove the turf.</li>\n<li>Add mulch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add brick pavers or metal edging to further define your flower bed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9preventweeds\">9. Prevent Weeds</h2>\n<p>While you can fight weeds with an herbicide, you may want to try some options that don’t require chemicals. For example, weeds take advantage of open spaces, so you can minimize their growth by placing your flowers close together. A thick layer of mulch can also smother out small weeds. Finally, avoid unnecessary tilling and cultivating once your garden gets going. Turning over your soil moves weed seeds to the surface and encourages their growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10hardenyourplantsfortheoutdoors\">10. Harden Your Plants for the Outdoors</h2>\n<p>If you started growing your plants inside, you need to gradually prepare them for being outside. The process is called hardening, and it protects seedlings by {{< external-link url=\"https://plantvillage.psu.edu/posts/3406-general-best-method-for-hardening-off-plants-in-spring\" text=\"thickening the cuticle on their leaves\" >}}.</p>\n<p>You can usually start hardening by placing your plants outdoors once the temperature hits 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave them in a place that’s protected from the wind and direct sunlight for about an hour. Gradually increase their time outdoors by about an hour every day, then move them to direct sunlight after two or three days. By the end of the second week, your plants will most likely be ready to transplant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11makeoveryouroutdoorspace\">11. Make Over Your Outdoor Space</h2>\n<p>With all the hard work you’ve put into your spring gardening, you’ll want to have a chance to enjoy it. Maybe that means investing in new patio furniture, adding a privacy fence, or decorating with wind chimes or gazing balls ﹘the choice is totally up to you. After all, you’ve earned the opportunity to put your feet up and enjoy your garden!</p>"

      title: "What Are Other Structures?"
      body: "<p>Home insurance isn’t nearly as difficult as you might think. But like any industry, we may use language that seems unfamiliar to people who don’t regularly work with it.</p>\n<p>A good example of this is “other structures.” Sometimes our representatives ask if a homeowner has any additional structures on their property, and the homeowner says they don’t. However, that’s seldom true.</p>\n<p>We think we can clear up this misunderstanding pretty easily so that people can get the right amount of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Read on to learn more about what other structures are, how they’re covered, and why that matters to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherstructuresaninsurancedefinition\">Other Structures: An Insurance Definition</h2>\n<p>Much of the confusion about other structures comes from people thinking that it’s just another way of saying “other buildings.” However, there are a lot of things that can count as other structures, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detached garages.</li>\n<li>Barns.</li>\n<li>Sheds.</li>\n<li>Gazebos.</li>\n<li>Pools.</li>\n<li>Fences.</li>\n<li>Driveways.</li>\n<li>Sidewalks.</li>\n<li>Permanently installed or anchored docks with their permanently installed equipment such as lifts and launches.</li>\n<li>Hot tubs.</li>\n<li>Other permanently installed outdoor fixtures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a pretty long list of other structures, and there’s a good chance your property has one or more of the items on it. But that’s okay, because your home insurance policy most likely covers them.</p>\n<p>You can usually find coverage for the structures on your property that aren’t attached to your <a href=\"/glossary/dwelling-means/\">dwelling</a> under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a> ﹘ the section that’s actually called “other structures.” Attached structures, like a porch or carport, often fall under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>. However, this can vary by insurance company, as can coverage for swimming pools. Some policies cover pools with Coverage A, but others use Coverage B.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchotherstructurescoverageshouldihave\">How Much Other Structures Coverage Should I Have?</h2>\n<p>We generally recommend you carry a minimum other structures coverage limit that’s 10 percent of your dwelling coverage. This may be enough to cover all of your other structures, but that really depends on your answers to several questions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What type and how many other structures are on your property?</li>\n<li>How much your other structures are worth?</li>\n<li>What can you afford to repair if you face a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answering these questions gives you an idea of how much you might have to pay if you experience catastrophic damage and how much risk you’re willing to take on. You can always decide to carry higher limits if it makes sense for your situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caniremoveotherstructurescoverage\">Can I Remove Other Structures Coverage?</h2>\n<p>You may be able to opt out of other structures coverage, but we don’t recommend it. The additional structures may not seem like a major expense, but they definitely can be. We looked at several sites to give you a sense of what it costs to rebuild or replace structures homeowners commonly have on their property. The results are in the chart below.</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagebuildingcostsofcommonstructures\">Average Building Costs of Common Structures</h3>\n<p>| Structure | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shed | $15 to $160 per square foot |\n| Driveway | $3 to $30 per square foot |\n| Hot tub | $2,000 to $8,000 |\n| Deck | $15 to $30 per square foot |\n| Fence | $15 to $60 per foot |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p>You also want to think about how likely you are to suffer some sort of damage to the other structures on your property. Anything that might wreck your home could just as easily ruin your other structures. For example, you want to be prepared if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning sets your gazebo on fire.</li>\n<li>High winds blow over your fence.</li>\n<li>A tree falls on your carport.</li>\n<li>Hail damages your pool liner.</li>\n<li>An errant driver knocks your garage off its foundation.</li>\n<li>A thief steals valuable tools from your garden shed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you look at all the items on your property that you need to protect, plus the risk of having to replace them, carrying at least the minimum Coverage B limit makes a ton of sense.</p>\n<p>Getting other structures coverage is simple when you work with us. But you can always talk to one of our insurance experts if you have questions. They’re happy to walk through every structure on your property to make sure that you have enough of the right amount of coverage.</p>"

      title: "What Causes a Power Surge?"
      body: "<p>You've been there before: you notice storm clouds gathering. A crack of thunder in the distance. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning blazes through the sky. The lights in your home flicker.</p>\n<p>That flicker may seem benign, but it's actually a sign of an unseen threat: power surges. Your lights may come back on without a hitch, but that’s usually accompanied by a surge in energy that can damage your home electronics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcausespowersurges\">What Causes Power Surges?</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"/blog/effects-of-thunderstorms/\">thunderstorms</a> are the easiest culprit to pin a power surge on, these events happen even when the weather is perfect. Electric companies can produce a power surge when they switch from running on one grid to another, or you may cause one when you plug too many devices into an extension cord. Your own appliances, especially high-powered ones like your refrigerator, may even cause a surge as they switch on and off.</p>\n<p>In each of these situations, one of two things is happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The flow of electricity has been momentarily interrupted and then started again.</li>\n<li>Something caused electricity to run back into the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s this sudden flow of electricity back through the circuit that causes a power surge.</p>\n<p>Most household appliances run on 120 volts, but the electrical flow is rarely a constant 120 volts. Typically, voltage fluctuates between 0 and 169 volts. Small surges for things like turning on a hairdryer can be anywhere from five to 10 volts, but a massive power surge sends voltage above 169 volts and that can lead to damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdamagecanpowersurgescause\">What Damage Can Power Surges Cause?</h2>\n<p>Power surges can affect home appliances and electronics. As electricity surges over the acceptable voltage range, it causes an arc of current. This arc generates heat and causes the circuit boards and other electrical components to overheat, and that can lead to degradation and damage.</p>\n<p>Often the damage caused by power surges is cumulative. This means that your television might work today but suddenly stop tomorrow if your home is experiencing a lot of electrical surges. But massive surges like those caused by lightning strikes can fry a system immediately.</p>\n<p>You should note, too, that anything with a microprocessor is particularly vulnerable to power surges. Microprocessors aren’t just found in your computers and microwaves, either. Your dishwasher, refrigerator, and other appliances may all have microprocessors that make them susceptible to damage from power surges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtopreventpowersurges\">How to Prevent Power Surges</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of common ways to keep power surges from affecting your appliances and electronics. The simplest is to unplug items if your power goes out. Unplugging everything that runs on electricity prevents a huge current from flowing into these items when the power turns back on. Most experts recommend just leaving one lamp plugged in so you know when the power returns. Once it’s back on, you can plug your electronics back in one by one.</p>\n<p>Other ways to protect your home from power surges involve additional equipment, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Point-of-use surge protectors:</strong> Point-of-use surge protectors look like power strips that you plug into a wall outlet. You then plug your appliance or electronic device into the point-of-use unit. Not all power strips are surge protectors, so make sure you find the right type.</li>\n<li><strong>Special electrical outlets:</strong> These are designed to cut power to the unit if there is a surge and are commonly used in areas where power strips are not convenient but there is a need to manage the voltage used when appliances are plugged in. For example, you might want one for the microwave in your kitchen.</li>\n<li><strong>A service entrance device:</strong> This is a type of surge protector that mounts to your electrical panel or meter and protects all the devices plugged into outlets throughout your home. Service entrance devices are installed by electricians and may require a permit for installation depending on your city codes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">Preventing claims</a> is probably one of the most important things you can do as a homeowner. Doing so not only makes your home safer, but it can also help you <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">lower your home insurance premiums</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverpowersurges\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Power Surges?</h2>\n<p>If a power surge does damage your appliances or electronics, you may be covered for the loss through your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Most home insurance policies have some coverage for sudden, accidental damage from man-made electricity and direct lightning strikes. However, <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\">claims for damage that happens over time</a> to electronics and appliances are usually excluded. In some cases, tubes, transistors, and other components aren’t covered either.</p>\n<p>Talk to your representative or read through your policy to see what exactly is covered. Keep in mind that your coverage has a deductible, so it may not be worth making a claim for minor issues.</p>"

      title: "What Determines Mortgage Rates?"
      body: "<p>If you’ve been thinking about buying a home, then rapidly rising interest rates have probably set your teeth on edge. The hikes started in mid-March, when the Federal Reserve approved the first interest rate increase in three years, and have continued into early summer.</p>\n<p>Market factors like the Federal Reserve Board certainly impact mortgage interest rates, but they aren’t the only ones that come into play. Here are eight more factors most lenders consider when they determine mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1creditscore\">1. Credit Score</h2>\n<p>Your credit score has a fairly direct impact on your mortgage rate because it tells a lender how consistently you pay off your debts and bills every month. That’s a good indicator of whether or not you're a good risk to lend money to.</p>\n<p>Lenders assume that a higher credit score means you are better at managing your money, and that usually results in a better mortgage interest rate. Most lenders look for credit scores that are at least in the high 600, but there are options for people with low credit scores. For example, <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan requirements</a> list minimum credit scores in the 500s.</p>\n<p>You should also note that your credit score can <a href=\"/blog/does-credit-score-affect-home-insurance-rates/\">affect your homeowners insurance rates</a> in some states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2employmentandincome\">2. Employment and Income</h2>\n<p>Some lenders take a look at your employment and income to determine your mortgage rate. The key here is consistency. Steady employment and income can lower interest rates because it’s a good sign that you make monthly payments. Lenders want consistency even from those who are self employed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3occupancy\">3. Occupancy</h2>\n<p>Getting a mortgage on a home you plan to live in usually comes with a lower interest rate than one for an investment property because investment properties carry more risk. A borrower is more likely to walk away from a property they’re renting to others than they are from their own home. This is generally true for second and vacation homes, too, and it usually means higher mortgage rates for these properties than on owner-occupied properties.</p>\n<p>Occupancy also impacts your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. For an investment property, you may need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>, but a vacation home could require <a href=\"/home-insurance/second-home-insurance/\">second home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4loanamount\">4. Loan Amount</h2>\n<p>Jumbo loans, or also called nonconforming conventional mortgages, can have higher interest rates. This is partially due to the risk. Neither Freddie Mac nor Fannie Mae can guarantee a jumbo loan, leaving the lender unprotected if the borrower defaults. With some exceptions, the current maximum amount for a conforming loan is $647,200 for most of the US. Jumbo loans exceed that amount.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, mortgages that are for a very low amount don’t earn much in terms of interest. Lenders sometimes charge additional fees on smaller loans to cover their costs and turn a profit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5downpayment\">5. Down Payment</h2>\n<p>A down payment shows your lender that you have skin in the game. As a result, your lender may charge a lower interest rate for a larger down payment, assuming that signals you’re more committed to owning and maintaining the property. Some homebuyers even pay points to bring down their loans and get better mortgage rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6loanduration\">6. Loan Duration</h2>\n<p>Loans with a longer duration, or loan term, mean the lender takes on more risk, so it usually increases the mortgage rate. For example, a 30-year fixed-rate loan typically has a higher interest rate than a 15-year fixed-rate loan for the same amount.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the loan with the shorter term may have higher monthly payments. The benefit, however, is that you end up paying the principal down faster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7interestratetype\">7. Interest Rate Type</h2>\n<p>There are two types of mortgage interest rates: fixed and adjustable. In a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest payment stays the same for the entire term. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), however, changes with the market. ARMs often start with a low introductory rate, but that may increase over time.</p>\n<p>If you decide on an ARM, you want to look closely at the terms of your loan. The low mortgage rate may seem like a way to save money, but it can quickly become more expensive than a fix-rate loan. Learn more about this in our article “How Does Mortgage Interest Work?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"8loantype\">8. Loan Type</h2>\n<p>Homebuyers can choose from several types of loans, including conventional loans and loans backed by the FHA, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Each comes with its own eligibility criteria and interest rates. Lenders can compare the rates of different loans for you if you are eligible for more than one type.</p>\n<p>For more help on mortgage, take a look at our article “<a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">Mortgages Explained: A First-Time Buyer’s Guide</a>.”</p>"

      title: "What happens to homeowners insurance when someone dies?"
      body: "<p>People get insurance to protect themselves from financial losses that might occur if something terrible happens to their homes. But what happens to homeowners insurance when someone dies?</p>\n<p>The answer, as usual, depends on the insurance company and the policy. But in this case, other factors can play a role, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the deceased was a named insured or an additional insured.</li>\n<li>Whether an executor has been named or not.</li>\n<li>What plans have been made for the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article looks at several possible situations and provides general advice for dealing with house insurance after the death of the policyholder.</p>\n<p>For Kin-specific information, please see our article “<a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-after-death/\">How Kin Handles the Death of a Customer?</a>”</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodowithhomeownersinsuranceduringprobate\">What to do with homeowners insurance during probate</h2>\n<p>Every <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> handles a policyholder’s death differently. Insurers may even have different requirements for different policies. That said, these three steps should hopefully get you on your way to figuring out what to do in your particular situation:</p>\n<h3 id=\"contactyourinsurer\">Contact your insurer</h3>\n<p>As uncomfortable as it may be, you need to let the insurance company know that a policyholder has passed. Most companies give you about 30 days to do this, and many accept a phone call. However, you will likely need to fax or email your insurer a copy of the death certificate.</p>\n<p>Please note that sometimes a death certificate isn’t available as quickly as an insurance company might want it. You still want to let the insurer know about the policyholder’s death. Some may accept other documentation, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A court order.</li>\n<li>The will of the deceased.</li>\n<li>An updated deed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don’t notify the insurance company, it may cancel the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">policy</a>, leaving the home unprotected from loss. This can lead to problems for the executor who is managing the estate or for the person who ultimately inherits the house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkintocoverageoptions\">Check into coverage options</h3>\n<p>When you notify the insurance company, take a moment to ask about coverage options. Many may allow you to keep the same policy until it expires as long as you pay the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-premium-definition/\">premium</a>. Others may ask you to buy a new policy. Be sure to note details, particularly deadlines, so you don’t have an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-lapse/\">insurance lapse</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"askabouthomeownersinsuranceduringprobate\">Ask about homeowners insurance during probate</h3>\n<p>Probate adds another wrinkle to explaining what happens to homeowners insurance when someone dies. The laws governing probate vary by state, so it’s difficult to provide a general description of what to do. Probably the most important step you can take is to keep in touch with the insurer as things change.</p>\n<p>For occupied house insurance during probate, you may want to get coverage in the executor’s name, especially if you plan on selling the property. Another issue to note is whether the house in question is going to be vacant for a month or more. That often requires a different policy called vacant home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtotransferhomeownersinsuranceforestateproperty\">How to transfer homeowners insurance for estate property</h2>\n<p>Transferring <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> on an estate property to a new owner often starts by determining who the deceased person is in relation to the policy. The people protected by a homeowners policy are typically called <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insureds</a>, but there are different types of insureds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/named-insured/\">Named insured</a>, or the person or entity that the policy protects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">Additional insured</a>, or a person or entity added to the policy.On a home insurance policy, the named insured is typically the <a href=\"/glossary/policyholder/\">policyholder</a>, or the person who purchased the coverage. Other family members living in the home are usually considered named insureds, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a primary policyholder has died and there are no other insureds, then the insurance company will likely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need a copy of the death certificate, will, or other documentation.</li>\n<li>Update the named insured to the estate of the deceased.</li>\n<li>Want the name of the estate executor.</li>\n<li>Ask what you plan to do with the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies can usually hold off on making major changes to the policy until an executor is named. Keep in mind, too, that the insurer will likely decide that the policy cannot be renewed, which means you’ll want to be aware of its expiration date to avoid a coverage lapse.</p>\n<p>Once the insurance company knows what’s happening to the house in question, its representative can help you figure out the next steps for transferring the home insurance. For example, if the house is to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transferred to a relative, then you may need to go through the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a> to transfer the policy.</li>\n<li>Rented to someone, then the coverage will need to be rewritten as a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>.</li>\n<li>Sold to a third party, then the insurer will probably cancel the policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, again, that insurance companies can have their own process for transferring home insurance after someone passes. Your insurer’s representative should be able to help you navigate the steps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappenstohomeownersinsurancewhenaspousedies\">What happens to homeowners insurance when a spouse dies?</h3>\n<p>After a spouse passes, the surviving spouse’s status on the home insurance policy can also come into play. Some insurers make both spouses named insureds, while others may choose to have one be the named insured and the other an additional insured.</p>\n<p>Let’s say the primary policyholder, or named insured, has passed away, and the surviving spouse is an additional insured. The insurance company may be able to simply make the surviving spouse the named insured. On the other hand, if the deceased was an additional insured, the primary policyholder remains the named insured.</p>\n<p>Either way, the surviving spouse needs to inform their insurance company to get the process started. Moreover, the insurance company will ultimately need to remove the deceased from the policy. This usually doesn’t happen until the estate has gone through probate.</p>\n<p>While dealing with probate may be a new experience for you, understand that insurance companies deal with homeowners insurance for probate every day. They have policies and procedures to handle the issue. Ask a lot of questions to make sure that you have the right coverage for the home while it transfers from one owner to the heir.</p>"

      title: "The NFIP & Government Shutdowns"
      body: "<h2 id=\"doesthenfipstillcoveryouduringashutdown\">Does the NFIP Still Cover You During a Shutdown?</h2>\n<p>In January 2018, the federal government shut down for two days when Congress couldn’t agree on a bill to provide continuous funding. One of the affected institutions was the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP (a branch of the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Luckily, funding was restored relatively quickly – but not for the long term. In fact, 2018 saw several close-calls with funding lapses for the program.</p>\n<p>As of December 22, 2018, the government is shut down again because of funding disagreements over the US-Mexico border wall. However, the NFIP is still issuing and renewing policies during this <a href=\"/blog/how-a-government-shutdown-impacts-homeowners/\">shutdown</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s no guarantee for long-term funding for the program, which means it could find itself in another precarious situation in the near future.</p>\n<p>So how might that affect homeowners who live in floodplains? Here’s an overview of what to expect the next time the NFIP temporarily loses funding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoesthenfipneedfundinginthefirstplace\">Why Does the NFIP Need Funding in the First Place?</h2>\n<p>The NFIP was created in 1968 to address the reality that private <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> options were falling short. Floods are the<a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program/\"> most common and costliest natural disaster</a> in the country and private insurers were sometimes unable to pay out on claims. The NFIP was developed to offer a government-backed subsidized alternative.</p>\n<p>Today, homes located in a floodplain bought with a mortgage are required to have flood insurance. Some lenders require that the insurance be through NFIP, making the organization an essential part of the home buying process in some parts of the country.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathappensifthenfiplosesfunding\">What Happens if the NFIP Loses Funding?</h2>\n<p>When the government shuts down and the NFIP goes unfunded, a few things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new NFIP flood insurance policies can be written.</li>\n<li>The NFIP cannot renew any policies.</li>\n<li>Home sales in certain areas freeze. If your mortgage company won’t lend you money without NFIP insurance and the NFIP can’t write you a policy, you can’t get the money you need to buy a house. During a four-week shutdown in 2012, the National Association of Realtors estimated that about 1,300 home sales per day were prevented because of missing NFIP funding.</li>\n<li>The NFIP continues to pay out valid claims… until it runs out of money. It cannot pay additional claims until it collects enough in incoming premiums or is allocated more money by Congress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, these are not desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p>What’s really frustrating, though, is that even though there’s general agreement that we need the NFIP, most people think it should be reformed. The thing is, we can’t agree on how to do that. The general attitude seems to be, “Why should we fund something that we know doesn’t work?” This isn’t helpful when nobody can agree on what needs to happen to make it work better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attemptstoimprovethenfip\">Attempts to Improve the NFIP</h2>\n<p>In 2012, the Biggert-Waters Act updated the NFIP, which was at the time<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program\"> more than $17 billion in debt</a>. The update required homeowners to pay insurance rates that matched their risk exposure, based on actuarial tables. It eliminated certain subsidies and the grandfathering in of earlier, lower rates.</p>\n<p>But in 2014, Congress passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which essentially delayed the reforms of Biggert-Waters and, rather than instating risk-based pricing, spread premium increases over all policyholders.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2901\">Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act</a> offers mostly technical updates to current law, but that bill didn't make it to the Senate.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: while it’s unlikely that lawmakers will agree on a comprehensive overhaul of the NFIP any time soon, it’s equally unlikely that they’ll let millions of homeowners go unprotected for the long term. If this is a matter you think needs more attention from Congress, consider <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members\">contacting the people who represent you</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was originally published in early 2018 and is periodically updated to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness. We believe the information in it is valuable, given the recurring threat of shutdowns amid federal budget negotiations, the increasing frequency of natural disasters, and the federal government’s critical role in</em> <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\"><em>providing disaster relief</em></a><em>.</em></p>"

      title: "What's a Cash-Out Refinance? Experts Explain"
      body: "<p>In a cash-out refinance, you take a loan out for the loan balance you already have plus a portion of the equity accumulated in your home. That amount beyond the loan balance can be used for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>Homeowners may use the cash from a cash-out refinance to consolidate debt, get a lower interest rate on credit, pay for a child’s college expenses, or remodel the house. Let’s take a look at when this refinancing option makes sense, according to financial experts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofacashoutrefinance\">The Benefits of a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>For many homeowners, their home is their biggest expense. This means saving even one percent of interest on your <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a> can mean saving hundreds or thousands of dollars every year. For example, a $300,000 mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate is $1,432 a month on a 30-year mortgage. The same mortgage at 3 percent drops to $1,265 a month.</p>\n<p>But that’s if you refinanced the existing mortgage dollar for dollar. What happens if you want to use your refinance to tackle that $15,000 of credit card debt that charges 21 percent interest? By adding the credit card debt to the mortgage, the credit cards are paid and you now pay the interest rate of the mortgage – far less than the credit cards. It’s a way to pay off debt for a more reasonable cost.</p>\n<p>Not everyone uses a cash-out refinance to pay off credit card bills though. Some use the equity in their home to fund their kids’ college education, wedding, or home renovations. Imagine having a home valued at $400,000 with a mortgage of $250,000. That’s $150,000 of equity sitting in your house. Often you can access up to 80 percent of the equity – or in this case, $120,000 to fund the big-ticket items in your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprosandconsofacashoutrefinance\">The Pros and Cons of a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>Like any financial decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of a cash-out refinance. To that end, Rick Orford of <a href=\"https://thefinanciallyindependentmillennial.com/\">The Financially Independent Millennial</a> warns that it isn’t an end-all solution to bad spending habits.</p>\n<p>“It doesn't matter if you earn $50,000 a year, or $150,000 a year,” Orford says, “unless you spend less than you earn, you'll never get ahead.”</p>\n<p>{{<table \"table table-striped table-bordered\">}}</p>\n<p>| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reduce the cost of more expensive debt | Extends your mortgage for a new term |\n| Often lowers your mortgage interest rate | Has closing costs |\n| Affords the opportunity to pay for big-ticket items | Has lengthy underwriting requirements including a credit report and appraisal |</p>\n<p>{{</table>}}</p>\n<p>While it seems like a cash-out refinance would solve a lot of problems, if you don’t plan on living in your home for years to come, it could affect your ability to qualify for another mortgage. You’ll have less equity, have a hard pull on your credit, and will need to account for the cost of an appraisal and closing costs.</p>\n<p>According to Tony Grech of <a href=\"https://www.luxurymortgage.com/\">Luxury Mortgage</a>, “You don’t need perfect credit to get a cash-out refinance, but these types of loans are viewed as much riskier than a purchase or a refinance to simply lower the rate on your loan balance.”</p>\n<p>It takes years to build up equity, and taking on more debt is not always a good idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcanyougetinacashoutrefinance\">How Much Can You Get In a Cash-Out Refinance?</h2>\n<p>In a cash-out refinance, you’re cashing out the equity in your home. How much equity you have will determine how much you can take out. An easy way to roughly calculate your home’s equity is to subtract your mortgage balance from your home’s current market value.</p>\n<p>For example, say your home’s market value is $256,000 and you have a $158,000 mortgage balance. You’d have about $98,000 in equity.</p>\n<p>In many loan circumstances, you can access up to 80 percent of the equity in the home. If we continue the example above, that means you could potentially take out $46,800 in your cash-out refinance.</p>\n<p>Lenders set your borrowing limit at 80 percent of your equity to leave you with a cushion in case the house drops in market value. That way you won’t owe more than the value of the home.</p>\n<p>It also gives the lender a cushion if you default on the property and they need to sell the home. The value will likely still have some equity, leaving them some room to negotiate with buyers.</p>\n<p>There is one exception to the 80 percent rule on a cash-out refinance: if you have a VA loan, you will be able to access up to 100 percent of the equity in the home.</p>\n<p>Exactly how much you can take out may be contingent on lender rules and your creditworthiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesacashoutrefinancework\">How Does a Cash-Out Refinance Work?</h2>\n<p>In order to get a cash-out refinance, you’ll have to qualify for it just like you did with your original mortgage. Lenders want to see at least a FICO credit score of 620, which is higher than a simple refinance score requirement of 580.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to meet the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of less than 50 percent. The DTI ratio is your monthly debt payments divided by your income. This includes your mortgage, car payments, and credit card payments.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you’ll need at least 20 percent equity in your home. This means for every $100,000 your home is valued at, you have at least $20,000 in equity. From there, you’ll be able to pull out up to 80 percent of that equity (or 100 percent if you have a VA loan).</p>\n<h2 id=\"cashoutrefinancevshelochomeequitylineofcredit\">Cash-Out Refinance vs. HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)</h2>\n<p>Homeowners should review the difference between a cash-out refinance and a HELOC to make sure they are doing the best thing for their financial situation. Unlike a refinance, a HELOC uses your equity to fund a line of credit that you can access at will. It often has a variable interest rate that is locked for one to three years.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, you tend to pay lower interest rates on a cash-out refinance than a HELOC. But remember that the loan is fixed for the life of your mortgage whereas a HELOC can be paid down quickly and reused for other purposes. Consider the closing costs along with the interest rate when comparing a refinance with a HELOC. You’ll want to run the numbers to see where you save the most.</p>\n<p>But if you’re doing a renovation of your home, a cash-out refinance can be a powerful financial tool. You’ll get lower interest rates and you’ll invest into the home which will only increase its market value.</p>\n<p>According to Matt Rostosky of <a href=\"https://www.cashofferky.com/\">Good Neighbor Solutions, LLC</a>, “Big-ticket home renovations give you the most out of your cash-out refinance money.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentonottakeacashoutrefinance\">When to Not Take a Cash-Out Refinance</h2>\n<p>In a cash-out refinance, you assume more debt and lock it in for a 15 to 30-year mortgage, so make sure it makes sense for your financial situation. In most cases, you don’t want to do the refinance if your interest rate will be the same or higher with the refinance. Your whole mortgage will get charged more interest, and that’s typically not a good move.</p>\n<p>It’s also not a good idea to do the cash-out refinance if you can’t consolidate all your high-interest credit debt. If you did the refinance anyway, you’d be paying more for your mortgage and still fighting high-interest rates on credit cards.</p>\n<p>Remember to consider the closing costs of the new loan, too. These costs could be as much as 5 percent of the mortgage amount – that could easily be $10,000 on a $200,000 loan. Make sure that your potential savings will be worth the cost of the loan. Your lender should provide you with a breakeven point that shows you how long into the new loan you will break even with the new costs. If it’s more than two to three years, a cash-out refinance might not be worth it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestrategicwithcashoutrefinances\">Be Strategic with Cash-Out Refinances</h2>\n<p>A cash-out refinance is a powerful way to tap the equity of your home to help you meet other <a href=\"/blog/financial-goals-for-homeowners/\">financial goals</a>. Whether you want to consolidate debt, remodel your home, or pay for college, the cash-out refinance gives you access to capital that’s otherwise tied up in your house. Remember to always consider the costs before doing a refinance so you don’t pay more than you should.</p>"

      title: "What is a house made of?"
      body: "<p>The materials used to build your home help determine what your home is worth, as well as its durability, energy efficiency, and sustainability. Building materials can even play a role in the cost of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a>. After all, certain materials can stand up to weather better than others, so they help reduce risk to your home.</p>\n<p>When evaluating house construction types, we can generally group them into four main categories of building materials. These categories are masonry, log, frame, and superior fire-resistive.</p>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at each.</p>\n<h2 id=\"masonry\">Masonry</h2>\n<p>Masonry homes consist of brick and stone structures. Components are put together with mortar. This is typically the most costly type of construction, but it does have its advantages. It has a high fire protection rating because it is non-combustible, plus it holds up better against natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. All of this means home insurance rates on masonry homes are usually lower than on homes built of other materials.</p>\n<p>Masonry construction has two other important benefits. The first is its increased thermal mass that helps the home remain energy efficient. Second, bugs and pests have a hard time penetrating masonry.</p>\n<p>For all of its advantages, masonry does have some limitations. Because it is so heavy, it is difficult and costly to transport. Homebuilders must pay added attention to the foundation because even a little settling can lead to cracks and potential moisture damage. Building these homes requires good weather, further limiting construction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"log\">Log</h2>\n<p>A log home consists of stacked logs where the same wood is seen from the inside as-is from the outside. There are three common house construction types for log homes: full scribe, post and beam, and timber frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full scribe:</strong> The full scribe log home stacks horizontal logs to form walls. Grooves cut into the logs allow them to be stacked snugly together. These homes are known for their energy efficiency and tend to withstand high winds and rains. They’re usually the most expensive to build, requiring more logs, specialized trades, and attention to the detail of eliminating gaps.</li>\n<li><strong>Post and beam:</strong> This type of log home uses full logs placed vertically as structural posts to support horizontal logs beams placed across them for structural support. Post and beam homeowners get maximum insulation and energy efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Timber frame:</strong> These homes are really a hybrid of a log home and a frame home. Logs are first used as posts and beams to hold the structure together and then finished with a square profile so that the rest of the walls can be framed together with traditional timber and siding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While log homes can be energy efficient and durable, they can also be subject to some unique risks﹘like wood-boring insects. However, their mass also means log homes are less likely to burn than a stud and drywall home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frame\">Frame</h2>\n<p>The simplicity, adaptability, and straightforward construction of frame homes make them the most popular house construction type built today. To build a frame house, builders use wood to create a skeleton, or frame, of the entire home. Frame houses typically have larger beams at ends and narrow beams in between with drywall or paneling filling in the spaces in between.</p>\n<p>One of the key benefits of a frame home is the price. Frame homes are relatively simple to build, and until recently, <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber was an affordable building material</a>. Additionally, frame homes let more natural light inside because builders can easily create large windows. In some parts of the country, frame homes are made with extreme high-pitch roofs to protect the house from the weight of snow.</p>\n<p>The drawback, however, is that wood-framed homes are considered more combustible than other types of building materials. That usually means you pay more for your homeowners’ insurance than you might with other types of construction materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"superiorfireresistive\">Superior fire resistive</h2>\n<p>Superior fire-resistive homes are considered non-flammable because they’re made of materials that can withstand high heat and flame, such as concrete. While the contents within the home are flammable, homeowners don’t need to worry about fires, including those starting from electrical components within walls. These homes are also well insulated and don’t fall victim to the attacks of pests.</p>\n<p>These homes can be both expensive and time-consuming to build. However, homeowners do save money on homeowners insurance and energy costs when they opt for fire-resistant materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"otherstructurematerials\">Other structure materials</h2>\n<p>Some non-traditional homes are built using other materials. For example, there are frame homes that don’t use timber but instead use steel studs. While steel studs are more commonly seen in commercial construction, they do add a layer of fire resistance and durability to the home to help reduce insurance costs. Some homes can also be made from prefabricated walls that use wood panels sandwiched together to create walls. These materials often result in more expensive homeowners insurance because of their flammability and potential to warp.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure about what type of building materials are used in your home, talk to your insurance representative. They can help assess the structure and make sure that you are properly insuring your home.</p>\n<p>To learn more about what goes into a home, check out \"<a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">5 Roof Shapes Every Homeowner Should Know.</a>\"</p>"

      title: "What is a mobile home?"
      body: "<p>There's a lot of misconceptions about mobile homes. Let's fix that.</p>\n<p>Since Kin broke the news that our insurance company now offers <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance in Florida</a>, we noticed some confusion. Folks asked us if we could cover RVs (that's a job for auto insurance). Some people rejoiced and sent photos of their campers (sorry, friends! Those aren’t mobile homes either). Some wondered if log cabins count as mobile homes (they do not). It seems the public at large may still have some misconceptions about what a mobile home really is.</p>\n<p>So let’s clear things up once and for all.</p>\n<p>Here is your official guide to everything a mobile home is – and isn’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomesvsmanufacturedhomesanoriginstory\">Mobile homes vs. manufactured homes: An origin story</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Kin_oct_2019/images/Mobile%20Home%20Insurance/mobile%20home%20main.jpg?width=1000&name=mobile%20home%20main.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><em>This is a mobile / manufactured home. Pretty cozy, right?</em></p>\n<p>The confusion over mobile homes largely stems from their origin. Prior to 1976, prefabricated, factory-built trailer homes were massed produced and marketed as mobile housing. These were like campers and travel trailers in that they could be transported and moved thanks to their trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches, but they were different in size and furnishings.</p>\n<p>But then the federal government stepped in to make sure affordable housing was safe for the American public. It passed the 1974 National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Act, followed by the 1976 HUD Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. These created federally regulated national building codes for all mobile homes to make them safer and more durable to the whims of Mother Nature.</p>\n<p>Post 1976, mobile homes are legally referred to as “manufactured homes” and must adhere to the HUD code building specifications. These factory-built homes are often moved to a location and kept there permanently.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fun fact: The HUD Code is the only federally regulated national building code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomevstrailer\">Mobile home vs. trailer</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/trailer.jpg?width=300&name=trailer.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>“Trailer” is a slang terms that often refers to mobile homes built before HUD began to oversee their construction. Trailers are small units with wheels attached permanently so they can travel. The photo here is probably what you picture when you hear this term.</p>\n<p>By contrast, modern mobile homes are usually permanently installed with a masonry foundation. They can be moved, but it’s very difficult and expensive to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whataboutmodularhomes\">What about modular homes?</h2>\n<p>Modular homes are homes that are designed in a special facility away from the homesite, which makes them similar to manufactured homes. However, these homes are designed and built in sections. The sections are then transported to the homesite, erected, tied together, and hooked up to utilities.</p>\n<p>While modular homes are designed and constructed off-site like manufactured homes are, these structures are generally considered sturdier than manufactured homes – in part because they’re often attached to a foundation. As a result, most insurance companies cover these homes using an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>. That’s the same type of homeowners insurance you’d get for standard home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"youmighthaveamobileormanufacturedhomeif\">You might have a mobile or manufactured home if …</h2>\n<p>If you’re like a growing portion of US homeowners, you may well have a mobile home. In Florida alone, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/12/florida-has-828000-mobile-homes-only-half-are-insured/\">more than 800,000</a> folks live in mobile homes.

      title: "What Is a Waterspout?"
      body: "<p>Florida and Louisiana have their share of natural disasters like hurricanes, and floods. Being so close to the ocean with such dynamic weather changes can also lead to another catastrophic event: a waterspout. A waterspout's potential for damage depends on the type of waterspout it is.</p>\n<p>Waterspouts are tornado-like whirlwinds of water mist and air that usually start over the ocean and can move over land.</p>\n<h2 id=\"waterspoutsdefined\">Waterspouts Defined</h2>\n<p>According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a waterspout is a “{{< external-link url=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/waterspout.html\" text=\"whirling column of air and water mist\" >}}.” They essentially look like a tornado over water, but certain waterspouts can move over land for some time. Waterspouts that move onto land can be dangerous and cause damage to both property and people.</p>\n<p>Waterspouts that hit land can be perilous because of their speed and size. While the average waterspout is 165 feet in diameter and lasts anywhere between two and 20 minutes, massive ones can exceed 330 feet in diameter and may last up to an hour. Wind speeds may exceed 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3typesofwaterspouts\">3 Types of Waterspouts</h3>\n<p>There are three types of waterspouts: fair weather, tornadic, and snowspout.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fair weather waterspouts</strong> are created from developing cumulus clouds and don’t move very much.</li>\n<li><strong>Tornadic waterspouts</strong> are associated with extreme weather, such as hurricanes and thunderstorms. They can move quite a bit and have the same characteristics as land tornadoes. If a tornadic waterspout hits land, the National Weather Service sounds a tornado warning for the local communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Snowspouts</strong> occur when a waterspout forms under the base of a snow squall. Sometimes called snow devils, snowspouts are rare and tend to be weak, though some have reached an EF1 warning level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdowaterspoutsform\">How Do Waterspouts Form?</h2>\n<p>How a waterspout forms depends on the type of waterspout it is.</p>\n<p>A fair weather waterspout occurs over open water when cool air sweeps across the surface and pulls the water up.</p>\n<p>Tornadic waterspouts are different in that they happen during thunderstorm conditions –&nbsp;some even start as tornadoes on land and move over water. Additionally, tornadic waterspouts are more likely to develop in the sky and reach down.</p>\n<p>The {{< external-link url=\"https://www.weather.gov/apx/waterspout\" text=\"five stages of a waterspout\" >}} are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dark spot:</strong> A light-colored disk becomes prominent on the water’s surface. This lighter disc is surrounded by a dark area with diffused edges.</li>\n<li><strong>Spiral pattern:</strong> Light- and dark-colored bands spiral out from the dark spot.</li>\n<li><strong>Spray ring:</strong> The dark spot develops a dense swirl of sea spray, called a cascade, that looks similar to the eye of a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Mature vortex:</strong> The spray ring expands into a spinning funnel that stretches from the water to the clouds above.</li>\n<li><strong>Decay:</strong> Warm air weakens the vortex, and it begins to dissipate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key component of any waterspout is the focused cold air cycling over the warm surface water. Once the conditions are met, a waterspout could develop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafefromawaterspout\">How to Stay Safe from a Waterspout</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, the NWS issues a tornado warning when a waterspout moves on land. But you can also protect yourself and your family by paying attention to weather conditions so you can avoid waterspouts altogether. For example, if you’re out on the water you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention to special marine warnings.</li>\n<li>Look for waterspouts underneath cumulus clouds with dark, flat bases.</li>\n<li>Move in a 90 degree angle away from a waterspout’s direction if you see one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, too, that you never want to try and move through a waterspout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arewaterspoutscoveredbyhomeownersinsurance\">Are Waterspouts Covered by Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>With speeds exceeding 50 miles per hour, homeowners could see damage from a waterspout, particularly if it picks up debris and sends it into their home. Luckily, most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> (including <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>) covers waterspouts as windstorm damage. However, if a waterspout happens because of hurricane conditions, homeowners should note that policies only cover damage caused by wind. Storm surge from a hurricane is usually covered by <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to make sure your insurance can handle whatever comes your way? We’ll be happy to review your policy to see if you’ve got all your bases covered.</p>"

      title: "What Is an Attractive Nuisance?"
      body: "<p>An attractive nuisance is anything on your property that someone, usually a minor, might see as fun, but that can also cause serious injuries. Depending on the laws in your area, you can be held responsible for those injuries﹘sometimes even if the person injured was trespassing on your property. The increased risk makes understanding what an attractive nuisance is an important part of protecting your home and the individuals who come on your property.</p>\n<p>After all, you probably want to keep your pool or tree house, so you need to know how you can minimize the chance of someone getting hurt. You also have to consider how the extra risk might impact your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a>. In some cases, your premiums may go up. Worse? Some insurance companies don’t insure homes with certain attractive nuisances. Yours may even <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">choose not to renew your policy</a> if you add a feature it doesn’t insure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examplesofattractivenuisances\">Examples of Attractive Nuisances</h2>\n<p>Here are some common attractive nuisances and what makes them dangerous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swimmingpool\">Swimming Pool</h3>\n<p>According to the Center of Disease Control (CDC), the US sees nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/facts/index.html\">4,000 fatal drowning every year</a>, so swimming pools and hot tubs are some of the biggest concerns for homeowners and insurance companies. Fatal drownings aren’t the only worry, either. A person can hit their head on a diving board or fall off a slide. This is why many insurance companies and city codes require fences and gates around pools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trampoline\">Trampoline</h3>\n<p>Jumping on a trampoline is a ton of fun, but it can also be risky. A <a href=\"https://www.aappublications.org/news/2019/09/10/focus091019\">study from the Academy of American Pediatrics</a> identified over 1 million trampoline-related injuries in a 10-year period. A third of those injuries were broken bones. That’s not surprising once you think of all the ways someone can get hurt on a trampoline. Not only can they lose their balance or step on a spring and get hurt, but the entire contraption can flip over or malfunction. And isn’t there always at least one person who wants to do somersaults and backflips? They’re just as likely to hurt someone else as they are themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"treehouse\">Tree House</h3>\n<p>Tree houses are often ten to fifteen feet in the air, which increases the chance that a fall will cause a serious injury. The risk for injury increases if the ground below has a hard surface. Moreover, tree houses are rarely built to any sort of building code standards, so there’s seldom any weight limit. If a group of kids flock to a tree house, there’s no telling at what point the structure may collapse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"playgroundequipment\">Playground Equipment</h3>\n<p>{{< external-link url=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/playground-injuries/playgroundinjuries-factsheet.htm\" text=\"Data from the CDC\" >}} shows that more than 200,000 children under the age of 14 visit emergency rooms for playground-related injuries, so you always need to make sure children at your home are playing on playground equipment safely. Even under the best of circumstances, kids can fall or get hurt on playground equipment. You can also reduce the likelihood of injury if you have a soft surface under your equipment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fishponds\">Fish Ponds</h3>\n<p>People can drown in just a few inches of water, so something that seems relatively safe, like a fish pond, can actually present a real risk. A child might lean over to see the fish, fall in, and hit their head. Like swimming pools, it’s best to keep fish ponds behind fencing and enclosed areas to limit access to it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constructionequipment\">Construction Equipment</h3>\n<p>You might not think of a construction area as attractive at all, children love exploring them and playing with any tools left lying around. If you’re in the middle of a project, make sure you put away your tools and unplug power tools even if you’re only stepping away for a moment. You don’t want a child to get their hands on a plugged in nail gun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weapons\">Weapons</h3>\n<p>Children are curious about weapons, especially guns. Most will pick up a gun or other weapon if they have the chance, and it takes just one unfortunate day for disaster to strike. Any weapons in your house should be under lock and key. If you have a gun, keep it unloaded and store the ammunition in a separate location. Display guns need to be unloaded and secured to the wall.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attractivenuisancesandhomeownersinsurance\">Attractive Nuisances and Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance doesn’t change the risk of any attractive nuisance, but it can reduce your financial exposure. The protection is found in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> that helps to pay costs if you’re found responsible for someone else’s property damage or physical injury.</p>\n<p>Most policies have at least $100,000 in personal liability coverage. However, you may want more if you have an attractive nuisance on your property. Increasing your liability coverage usually doesn’t cause a substantial increase in your premiums, and the additional protection is often well worth the extra cost.</p>\n<p>Not every insurance company insures every attractive nuisance. Those that do, may impose safety restrictions before they’ll insure it. This might include putting a gate around your pool and removing the diving board or buying a certain type of gun safe. An underwriter may actually come out to check that you’re following these safety restrictions.</p>\n<p>You may also want to check with your insurer before you add a feature that might be considered an attractive nuisance. You’re better off finding out if your policy covers your new pool before you install it.</p>"

      title: "What Is an Exurb?"
      body: "<p>Living in a city definitely has its allure. At the very least, being in the heart of an urban area gives you more options when it comes to entertainment, employment, and healthcare. But the trade-off is usually higher prices and smaller living spaces.</p>\n<p>But lately, people are looking to get out of cities﹘particularly now that remote work has become more common. Some got as far as the suburbs, but others made it as far as an exurb.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exurbsdefined\">Exurbs Defined</h2>\n<p>Most simply, exurbs are locations beyond a metropolitan area and its suburbs. According to {{< external-link url=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/finding-exurbia-americas-fast-growing-communities-at-the-metropolitan-fringe/\" text=\"Finding Exurbia: America’s Fastest Growing Communities at the Metropolitan Fringe\" >}} from the Brookings Institution, an area can be called an exurb it is has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 20 percent of its workers commuting to a nearby city.</li>\n<li>Low housing density.</li>\n<li>Population growth that exceeds that of the nearby city.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many areas, exurbs tend to be at least somewhat rural﹘ moving to one doesn't necessarily mean you own farmland, but you may see more than one neighbor <a href=\"/blog/raising-backyard-chickens/\">raising backyard chickens</a>. However, exurbs can also be small towns or villages located just beyond a city’s suburbs.</p>\n<p>Long story short? Exurbs probably won’t show up on anyone’s list for <a href=\"/blog/best-places-to-live/\">top places to live</a>, but only because they tend to be lesser known locations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exurbsvssuburbwhatsthedifference\">Exurbs vs. Suburb: What’s the Difference?</h2>\n<p>Exurbs and suburbs do share some characteristics. For example, both exurbs and suburbs have a percentage of residents who commute to jobs in a nearby city, plus lower housing density. Both also tend to be more spread out so residents often need to drive more.</p>\n<p>However, suburbs are more likely than exurbs to have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subdivisions developed by a single real estate company.</strong> These often consist of tract homes where buyers can choose from several model homes with slight variations.</li>\n<li><strong>More complex road systems.</strong> Suburban roads typically include cul-de-sacs that give way to larger residential streets that ultimately connect to even larger roads and highways.</li>\n<li><strong>Well-known stores and restaurants.</strong> Many suburbs are known for being home to malls with plenty of parking, major box big stores, and franchised restaurants.</li>\n<li><strong>Public transportation.</strong> Suburbs often have buses and commuter trains, particularly when they are closer to the city they support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exurbs, on the other hand, are farther away from cities, past the suburbs, which means they’re less likely to have many of the amenities found in the city and suburbs. For example, some exurbs may have a central business district, but the stores are usually not national chains. And not only is public transportation rare, but exurbs are usually not very walkable. You’re also less likely to see subdivisions with homes that look alike in exurbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keybenefitsofexurbs\">Key Benefits of Exurbs</h2>\n<p>Because they are even farther away from major cities, exurbs are often more affordable than suburbs. This means that homeowners can get more house for their money. Lot sizes are also bigger, and the additional space provides greater privacy than what you find in the city.</p>\n<p>Being away from the city and having more space between homes also reduces noise levels. The only sounds you may hear are birds chirping or a deer rustling in the bushes along the edge of your property.</p>\n<p>Living in an exurb can also mean less pollution. While people definitely have to drive more, there are few cars, and that reduces the amount of emissions you breathe. And with fewer people, there is almost always less trash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aretheexurbsrightforyou\">Are the Exurbs Right for You?</h2>\n<p>While a lower cost of living and a quieter lifestyle sounds great, the exurbs aren’t for everyone. The first question to answer is whether your job will allow you to telecommute at least some of the time. The willingness of some tech giants to allow remote work is one reason the exurbs of San Francisco Bay, areas like Brentwood and Petaluma, have grown recently.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to be comfortable being farther away from some basic necessities. Grocery stores and dry cleaners may be a 30-minute drive rather than just down the block. Moreover, you will likely have fewer retailers to pick from. The same may be true of cultural activities. Dinner and a show might take additional planning if you have to drive over an hour to attend.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you need to weigh what you’re willing to give up against what the exurbs have to offer. Is a bigger home and more privacy worth a longer commute or fewer nights out on the town? You’re the only one who can answer that question.</p>"

      body: "<p>Learn what an insurance claim is and when to file one.</p>\n<p>It’s troubling to think that the home you are so invested in could one day become damaged or destroyed. Choosing a quality insurance policy will set you up for success in the event of a disaster.</p>\n<p>Accidents happen. This article will equip you with the tools you need to file an insurance claim so that, when that flood strikes, you will be able to continue to equip your life with the stability and comfort your family needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howinsuranceclaimswork\">How Insurance Claims Work</h2>\n<p>An insurance claim is a reimbursement for property damage by a homeowners insurance company based on the terms of their insurance policy. Homeowners pay a monthly fee or premium to their insurance company in exchange for the assurance that the insurance company will reimburse them for <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">damage from a disaster</a>. When a disaster strikes, the homeowner files an insurance claim with their insurance company. The homeowner will need to compile a list of receipts and expenses and send that into their insurance company with their claim.</p>\n<p>An adjuster will then be assigned to inspect the damage and report back their assessment to your insurance company, which will base their approval or denial of the homeowners claim on the adjustor’s report. Of course, the first step to having recourse to a claim when disaster strikes is to prepare with the right type of policy and documentation beforehand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdifferentpoliciesimpactinsuranceclaims\">How Different Policies Impact Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Did you know there are nine different types of homeowners insurance? Whether you are renting or an owner, own a mobile home, or are part of a co-op or condo will influence what kind of insurance you choose. The region where you live should also impact this decision.</p>\n<p>HO-1: This policy protects a home against 11 disasters including: fire and lightning; windstorms and hail; explosion; riots and civil commotion; aircraft; vehicles; smoke; vandalism and malicious mischief; theft; glass that is part of the home; and volcanic eruptions.</p>\n<p>HO-2: This policy includes: damage from falling objects, water accidental overflow of plumbing, heating air-conditioning, household appliances. Everything included in HO-1 is also covered.</p>\n<p>HO-3: Is the most common policy as it is the most all-inclusive. It includes all the disasters contained in HO-1 and HO-2 and also: Overflow of freezing pipes, heating, A/C, or other household appliances, Tears, cracks, and burns in water heater, A/C. or sprinkler system, damage from electrical currents in appliances and wiring, all other perils except those specifically excluded in policy, floods, earthquakes, and sinkholes— the last three are purchased in a policy specific to that disaster.</p>\n<p>HO-5 is the most comprehensive policy and includes all disasters in HO-3 plus maximum coverage for personal belongings as well as every and all disaster not specifically excluded by the policy.</p>\n<p>When purchasing a homeowners policy it’s important to be aware of the laws in your state; Each state is different. Some states are more prone to natural disasters than others and each state is prone to a different set of natural disasters. Therefore, the laws of each state have been created to indicate whether homeowners need to have <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">protection against hurricanes</a>, floods, or earthquakes, etc. accordingly.</p>\n<p>For instance, Florida and Texas are two states that have perhaps the highest proclivity for natural disasters including hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Florida suffered the most from Hurricane Katrina—the most expensive natural disaster in American history. Meanwhile, Texas sets the record for the most natural disasters in one state at 86.</p>\n<h3 id=\"casestudiesfloridatexas\"><strong>Case Studies: Florida & Texas</strong></h3>\n<p>One caveat worth bearing in mind, is that earthquake, sinkhole and <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Florida: Hurricane Deductibles</strong></p>\n<p>Florida provides a particularly nuanced use case because the state’s government requires homeowners to insure against disaster with hurricane deductibles (<a href=\"https://www.iii.org/issue-update/background-on-hurricane-and-windstorm-deductibles\">as do 18 other states</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Texas: Windstorm & Hail</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Texas Department of Insurance web site “The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) is the state's insurer for windstorm and hail coverage. You may buy TWIA coverage through local insurance agents if you need it.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"filinganinsuranceclaim\">Filing an Insurance Claim</h2>\n<p>Now we get to the crucial part: filing the insurance claim itself. Before disaster strikes, it’s important to keep an inventory of the receipts of all your valuables, mortgage, etc. in a disaster-proof safe. Disaster strikes. Continue to record all of your activities, including:</p>\n<p>(1) Damaged items even if they are destroyed</p>\n<p>(2) The amount required for temporary housing and relocation</p>\n<p>(3) Prior receipts in your off-site / disaster proof safe</p>\n<p>(4) Any additional living expenses that arise as a result of the damage</p>\n<h3 id=\"tofileornottofileaninsuranceclaim\">To File or Not to File an Insurance Claim?</h3>\n<p>Believe it or not, sometimes it’s good not to file an insurance claim. If the cost of the claim is bigger than the deductible, it is almost never worth it. This may result in a significant hike in your premiums. This is especially true if you file more than one claim a year. Insurance claims are for large disasters after all, and typically aren’t worth the hike in premium otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtofileahomeownersinsuranceclaim\">How to File a Homeowners Insurance Claim</h3>\n<p><strong>Dos</strong>\nPlan in advance\nKeep a record of all valuables with serial numbers in a fireproof safe\nFile your claim within 60 days\nContact your mortgage lender\nBe aware that your mortgage fees will be deducted from your payout\nKeep receipts from repairs &amp; lodging\nBe aware of state laws affecting insurance premiums\nHire a public adjustor</p>\n<p><strong>Don'ts</strong>\nWait too long\nDispose of damaged items\nFile with an unreliable policy</p>"

      title: "What Is Hazard Insurance?"
      body: "<p>If you have a mortgage, chances are you know you're supposed to have hazard insurance. But what is it and how does it differ from home insurance? Find out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hazardinsurancevshomeownersinsurance\">Hazard Insurance vs Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you took on a mortgage loan to buy your home, chances are your lender required you to carry “hazard insurance.” If you already have homeowners insurance, rest assured: hazard insurance is almost certainly included. Either way, here’s a breakdown of what home hazard insurance is and why you need to have it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hazardinsurancecoverageforthestructureofyourhome\">Hazard Insurance: Coverage for the Structure of Your Home</h2>\n<p>Essentially, hazard insurance (also sometimes called “<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>”) is coverage that protects only the structure of your home: bricks, shingles, window panes, doors. The house itself.</p>\n<p>Mortgage companies want you to have this coverage because they’re financially invested in the structure: they’ve fronted you the money to purchase this house. Until you’ve paid off the loan, the house itself is the mortgage lender’s biggest bargaining chip: if you stop making payments, for example, they can foreclose on it and resell the property to recover some of their loss.</p>\n<p>If a fire burns the house down, the insurance ensures that it will be rebuilt – and you won’t just walk away from whatever debt remains on the loan. In other words, it’s in the mortgage lender’s best interest to make sure there’s a plan for fixing anything that goes wrong with the house.</p>\n<p>Typical hazard insurance offers protection for damage to your home caused by events (also called “perils”) such as…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightning.</li>\n<li>Fire.</li>\n<li>Theft and vandalism.</li>\n<li>Hail.</li>\n<li>Falling objects.</li>\n<li>Wind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most hazard insurance policies (and most standard homeowners insurance policies, for that matter) do NOT offer coverage for damage caused by…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mudslides.</li>\n<li>Landslides.</li>\n<li>Sinkholes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Floods</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whathazardinsurancedoesntcover\">What Hazard Insurance Doesn’t Cover</h2>\n<p>Besides excluding structural damage from certain types of events, hazard insurance also doesn’t offer coverage for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, including anything that can be picked up and moved around inside your house. This is protected by contents coverage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expenses</a> if a guest is hurt in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability</a> expenses if a hurt guest sues you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use</a> of your home (when you need to stay in a hotel because your home is temporarily unlivable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The good news: a standard homeowners policy includes not only hazard insurance but also everything listed above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancehazardinsurancemuchmore\">Homeowners Insurance = Hazard Insurance + Much More</h2>\n<p>Chances are, if you’re buying a home, you’re planning to get insurance regardless of what the mortgage company requires you to do. And even if you’re paying cash for your home, hazard insurance makes sense. It’s just plain smart to protect the single biggest purchase you’ve ever made.</p>\n<p>The bottom line about hazard insurance is that you don’t have to shop for it separately from your regular homeowners insurance. It’s standard practice for insurance companies to include it in a homeowners policy (after all, it wouldn’t be much of a policy if it didn’t protect the home itself). In some policies, you’ll see it referred to as dwelling insurance, but no matter the name, it offers the same protection: coverage for the physical structure of your house.</p>\n<p>Ready to find out how much you’ll play for a homeowners policy that includes hazard insurance, contents coverage, personal liability, and more? <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote</a> in two minutes or less.

      title: "What Is Home Warranty Insurance?"
      body: "<p>Home warranty insurance is a service contract that covers damage to major household appliances and systems. It is not the same as homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homewarrantyinsurancevshomeinsurance\">Home Warranty Insurance vs. Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>Home warranty insurance is a service contract that covers damage to major household appliances and systems, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Air conditioning units</li>\n<li>Ductwork</li>\n<li>Furnace</li>\n<li>Water heater</li>\n<li>Kitchen appliances</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much like a manufacturer’s warranty, a home warranty pays to repair or replace a covered item when it malfunctions within a certain time frame, typically a year. These contracts cover damage from regular use and age, which is one reason homeowners find them so attractive, especially if they are new buyers or are purchasing an older home.</p>\n<p>Another benefit for homeowners is the simplicity of a home warranty. When their dishwasher breaks down, they only have to make one phone call. The home warranty company takes care of the rest.</p>\n<p>While a home warranty may be a good fit for your needs, it doesn’t replace the need for homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ishomewarrantyinsurancethesameashomeinsurance\">Is Home Warranty Insurance the Same as Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>No. A home warranty is not the same as a home insurance policy. <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> primarily offers three types of protections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Property coverage for the</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>physical structure</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Standard policies usually include your home and other structures on your property, like a garage.</li>\n<li><strong>Property coverage for the things inside the home.</strong> Imagine turning your home upside down and shaking it. Anything that falls out is your personal property and is typically covered by your homeowners insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Liability coverage.</strong> This protection can cover your legal responsibility to the people who visit your home. It kicks in when someone is injured at your house or when you damage someone’s property.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your appliances are your personal property, and your home insurance can help pay to replace them when covered events damage them, like a fire or windstorm. However, it won’t cover their replacement when they simply won’t work or malfunction. For that, you’d need a home warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedshomewarrantyinsurance\">Who Needs Home Warranty Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Home warranty insurance may not offer the same protections a homeowners policy does, but you may still want to investigate the option if you’re:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A first-time buyer with no home maintenance experience.</li>\n<li>Buying an older house or a house with older appliances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chances are you won’t have to look far for a home warranty company, but pick a reputable one to avoid potential scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Research the company.</strong> Read reviews and look the company up on the Better Business Bureau or state’s department of insurance before you commit to a yearlong service agreement.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the warranty.</strong> Your plan can exclude certain components, require you to use certain repair companies, or deny payment for unusual wear and tear.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the company’s address.</strong> A P.O. box or other types of short-term rental space doesn’t necessarily mean a company isn’t reputable, but it can be a warning sign that it isn’t going to be around when trouble hits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customer reviews are also a useful way to assess a company’s credibility. Look them up on Yelp or Trustpilot to get an impression of fellow homeowners’ experiences.</p>"

      title: "What not to fix when selling a house"
      body: "<p>You can do a lot of things to make your home more desirable to buyers when you put it on the market, like decluttering and removing personal items. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you need to fix every little thing before you can sell your house. Some improvements simply aren’t worth the money or effort. Here’s our list of what not to fix when selling a house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1dontmakemajorcosmeticrenovations\">1. Don’t make major cosmetic renovations</h2>\n<p>Everyone oohs and aahs when they see a freshly renovated kitchen, but the return is seldom one to one. In fact, realtors estimate that homeowners recover about {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-remodeling-impact-10-03-2019.pdf\" text=\"60 percent\" >}} of what you spend, and that doesn’t take into consideration the stress that comes with remodeling on a tight deadline. Plus, only 10 percent of realtors said kitchen renovations helped close a sale.</p>\n<p>Certain renovations may be appropriate﹘even necessary﹘for your home or in your market, but you can’t assume they are. In some cases, you may be better off listing your home just under the competition and saving yourself the work. A local agent can help you figure if any improvements will have an impact on your sale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2dontoverhaulyourlandscaping\">2. Don’t overhaul your landscaping</h2>\n<p>Real estate agents often emphasize the importance of curb appeal when selling a home, so you may be tempted to give your yard a major makeover. However, a complete tear out and remodel costs between {{< external-link url=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/landscape/\" text=\"$10 - $40 per square foot\" >}}.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of money to spend on a good first impression, especially when there are many <a href=\"/blog/easy-curb-appeal-ideas/\">easy ways to boost your home’s curb appeal</a>. Trimming trees and bushes, cleaning up dead leaves, and mowing the grass are all good places to start. After that, head to your local garden store for colorful plants to add some pop to the walkway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3dontembracethelatesttrends\">3. Don’t embrace the latest trends</h2>\n<p>Trends come and go, so <a href=\"/blog/interior-design-trends-2021/\">what’s cool now</a> can seem dated in a heartbeat. More importantly, you want the people who come to your showings to be able to see themselves in your home. Super trendy decor can make that difficult for them. Give potential buyers a mostly blank slate and they’ll start imaging what they can do with your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4dontaddquirkyfeatures\">4. Don’t add quirky features</h2>\n<p>When you own a home, you can design it however you see fit. Your options are really only limited by your imagination and budget. But when it comes time to sell, every off-the-wall decor feature can distract potential buyers from your home’s value. For example, you may think a urinal in the master bath is a great space saver or the pink tile on your kitchen cabinets is fun and easy to care for, buyers are calculating what it might cost to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5dontreplaceworkingappliances\">5. Don’t replace working appliances</h2>\n<p>Brand new appliances are a nice bonus when buying a home, but older models are seldom a deal breaker if they’re working. Moreover, new appliances won’t have much impact on your <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">home appraisal</a>. Instead, give the appliances you have a good cleaning.</p>\n<p>Broken appliances, however, are a horse of a different color. Those may need to be replaced, particularly those in the kitchen. However, brand new refrigerators, dishwashers, and ovens can be pricey, so consider replacing them with used or floor models.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6dontreplaceyourroof\">6. Don’t replace your roof</h2>\n<p>The roof is one of the most important aspects of any home, so you want to replace yours when it shows <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">signs of age</a>. However, you aren’t required to replace your roof when you put your house up for sale.</p>\n<p>You are, however, required to disclose leaks and prior damage in most states, so it’s best to be upfront about any issues. This may mean you have to make minor repairs or even discount the cost of a new roof to close the deal, but that’s definitely better than being sued down the road. But in a seller’s market, buyers may be more willing to deal with a less-than-perfect roof in order to buy in the area they want.</p>\n<p>Knowing what not to fix when selling a house isn’t always clear cut. Market conditions can have a major influence on how homebuyers react to what you’re offering, which is why it’s important to work with a licensed professional. A local agent deals with the real estate market every day and can help you decide what repairs are truly necessary.</p>"

      body: "<p>Welcome to National Hurricane Preparedness Week!</p>\n<p>Every year, National Hurricane Preparedness Week gives people the chance to share information about hurricane risk. Our contribution this year is to let you know what’s in store hurricane season 2022. That’s knowledge you can use to identify your risk and better protect your home and family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneseason2022overview\">Hurricane Season 2022: Overview</h2>\n<p>The first {{< external-link url=\"https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html\" text=\"extended range estimate\" >}} from the Colorado State University (CSU) Tropical Meteorology Project came out on April 7, 2022, and it predicted above-normal activity for the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season in the form of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>19 named storms.</li>\n<li>9 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scientists at CSU say that a shift from the current La Niña cycle to an El Niño is unlikely. El Niño cycles often produce below-normal hurricane seasons.These predictions are an increase from the {{< external-link url=\"https://resilience.iii.org/resilience-blog/hurricanes/initial-estimate-for-2022-atlantic-hurricane-season-above-average-again\" text=\"project’s earlier projection\" >}} of 13 to 16 named storms and six to eight hurricanes. CSU plans to issue updates on June 2, July 7, and August 4.</p>\n<p><strong>August 4, 2022 - UPDATE -</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released an {{< external-link url=\"https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.shtml\" text=\"updated forecast for hurricane season 2022\" >}}, now predicting a 60 percent chance for above-normal activity. NOAA also predicts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>14 to 20 named storms.</li>\n<li>6 to 10 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>3 to 5 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CSU Tropical Meteorology Project also updated its predictions on August 4 and is now forecasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>18 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both organizations say these numbers still represent an above-normal hurricane season for 2022 and encourage people to be prepared for storms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoeshurricaneseason2022comparetolastyear\">How Does Hurricane Season 2022 Compare to Last Year?</h3>\n<p>At the start of the 2021 season, the CSU team {{< external-link url=\"https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2021/11/30/csu-researchers-correctly-predicted-above-average-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season\" text=\"correctly predicted above-average hurricane activity\" >}}, anticipating:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>17 named storms.</li>\n<li>8 hurricanes.</li>\n<li>4 major hurricanes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team increased its projections in subsequent updates to 18 named storms. In the end, the season ended with 21 named storms and seven hurricanes, with four falling into the major hurricane category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morehurricanesforthenorthernus\">More Hurricanes for the Northern US?</h2>\n<p>Another interesting statistic from CSU’s Tropical Meteorology Project: Just 40 years ago, only 12 percent of hurricanes, tropical storms, and tropical depressions hit these states. Now about 16 percent are expected to make landfall in the northern US each year.</p>\n<p>The statistic appears to jibe with a recent study published in Nature Geoscience that predicts {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00859-1\" text=\"more storms\" >}} will reach midlatitude regions, or areas located between 30° and 60° latitude. This means cities that don’t often see named storms, like New York, Boston, and Baltimore, may need to prepare for hurricanes in 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricanesandclimatechange\">Hurricanes and Climate Change</h2>\n<p>We may be in for another above-average hurricane season in 2022, but according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), scientists haven’t connected the dots between the number of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/\" text=\"hurricanes and climate change\" >}}. But the data does suggest that we are in for more intense hurricanes because sea levels and surface temperatures are rising.</p>\n<p>Climate change, however, might be the reason more cities outside of the traditional hurricane zone may suffer through more storms. According to C2ES, hurricanes’ migration towards both poles may be the result of rising global temperatures. Plus, the lead author of the Nature Geoscience study stated in a {{< external-link url=\"https://news.yale.edu/2022/01/03/future-hurricanes-will-roam-over-more-earth-study-predicts\" text=\"press release\" >}} that this shift as “an important, under-estimated risk of climate change.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforhurricaneseason2022\">How to Prepare for Hurricane Season 2022</h2>\n<p>The key to preparing for any potential problem is knowing your chance of experiencing a hurricane. This may be even more important now as more cities appear to have increased hurricane risk.</p>\n<p>Once you understand if you’re likely to see a hurricane, you can develop a plan to help you weather the storm. For example, you want to prepare a <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">hurricane plan</a> that includes steps like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drawing up an evacuation route.</li>\n<li>Putting together an evacuation kit.</li>\n<li>Purchasing essential supplies if you need to shelter in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also want to think about ways you can make your home more resilient, such as buying <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\">hurricane shutters</a> or trimming tree branches. Josh Skolnick of {{< external-link url=\"https://mightydogroofing.com\" text=\"Mighty Dog Roofing\" >}} recommends taking the time to “regularly check and maintain your roof as a preemptive measure.” Doing this can minimize your chances of suffering water damage.</p>\n<p>Another part of your hurricane preparedness plan is to review your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> to make sure you have the coverage you need. Home insurance, for example, often covers damage caused by hurricane winds, but water damage from an external source is usually excluded. This may mean you need <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> as well.</p>"

      title: "What to Do During a Flood"
      body: "<p>There’s no question that floods are becoming more common and that they bring dangerous conditions and costly damage. Knowing what to do before the waters rise, when the flood is actually happening, and after everything is over is key to making sure your home and family are safe. If you live somewhere expecting a flood, here’s what you need to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforaflood\">How to Prepare for a Flood</h2>\n<p>Preparation is critical in any natural disaster. Often the steps you need to take come long before authorities issue any sort of warning. These include making a plan, protecting your home, creating an emergency kit, and getting flood insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1makeanemergencyplan\">1. Make an Emergency Plan</h3>\n<p>In the event of an evacuation, you want to know where you will go and how you will get there. This means <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">creating an emergency plan</a>, and most importantly, sharing it with everyone in the family. Your emergency plan should address issues that may come up if you’re ordered to evacuate, such as where your family will meet if you’re not together during the evacuation.</p>\n<p>You may want to designate someone outside of your area to who you can check in with to let people know you are safe and don’t need assistance. This person can also help your family reconnect if you get separated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2prepareyourhome\">2. Prepare Your Home</h3>\n<p>In addition to making a plan, you can prepare your home so it has minimal damage after a flood. New homes built on a floodplain should be elevated to avoid water saturation. But if your home is already built, you can elevate utilities such as the furnace, water heater, and electric panel. You can also hire a plumber to install check valves that allow water to keep sewer water from backing up into your house.</p>\n<p>Before a flood occurs, you might also want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy sandbags or other home barriers and store in your garage.</li>\n<li>Install a water alarm.</li>\n<li>Get a battery-operated backup sump pump.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a flood is imminent, you may also want to move your furniture and other valuables to a higher floor. Getting these items into your attic may minimize your overall damage. That said, only take these measures if you can do so safely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3buildanemergencykit\">3. Build an Emergency Kit</h3>\n<p>For floods, the first step is to put together an emergency kit. This is a grab-and-go bag rather than a shelter-in-place kit because of the chance that you may need to evacuate quickly.</p>\n<p>A basic grab-and-go kit should have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready-to-eat, non-perishable food.</li>\n<li>Water.</li>\n<li>A battery-powered radio.</li>\n<li>A flashlight.</li>\n<li>Extra batteries.</li>\n<li>First aid kit.</li>\n<li>Personal medications.</li>\n<li>Emergency blanket.</li>\n<li>Whistle.</li>\n<li>Toothbrush, toothpaste, and other toiletries.</li>\n<li>Cash in small bills.</li>\n<li>Copy of important documents.</li>\n<li>N95 masks.</li>\n<li>Your emergency plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A shelter-in-place kit is fairly similar. The main difference is an emergency kit that stays in your home may have some additional items, like more water and seasonal clothes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4getfloodinsurance\">4. Get Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>There’s no question that floods are becoming more common or that they bring dangerous conditions and costly damage. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), even an inch of water can lead to <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/calculator\">$25,000 worth of flood damage</a>.</p>\n<p>While just about every homeowner has some <a href=\"/blog/flood-risk-management/\">flood risk</a>, standard homeowners policies don’t cover it, and that makes <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> critical. Don’t get caught <a href=\"/blog/underinsurance-report/\">underinsured</a>. Talk to us about your flood risk. We offer a flood insurance endorsement for as little as $175 per year so you can be fully protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafeduringaflood\">How to Stay Safe During a Flood</h2>\n<p>Emergency broadcast systems have gotten very good about making sure people have time to evacuate. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t end up in a situation where you have to make quick decisions to protect your home and your family.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1protectyourhome\">1. Protect Your Home</h3>\n<p>If authorities have issued a flood warning, you can start protecting your home with barriers. Put sandbags where water might seep in, such as doors (particularly sliding glass doors) and garages. You may also want to put your belongings on top of counters or move them to upper floors. Also, bring outdoor furniture into the house so it doesn’t get swept away in the flood.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2protectyourfamily\">2. Protect Your Family</h3>\n<p>The most important thing here is to stay informed by listening to weather alerts on the news and to locate your emergency kit so you’re prepared to evacuate. If you are given an evacuation order, turn off the gas and electricity, grab your emergency kit, and leave.</p>\n<p>Follow directions from the authorities as you evacuate, and do your best to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid walking, swimming, or driving through floodwaters.</li>\n<li>Avoid bridges over fast-moving water.</li>\n<li>Stay in your car; only get on the roof if water is rapidly rising within it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you haven’t been ordered to evacuate, pay attention to the water sources around you, such as streams that can overflow with little warning. Flash floods happen quickly and don’t need rain clouds or heavy rain in the area of flooding – meaning they don’t always announce themselves ahead of time.</p>\n<p>If water is already in your home, avoid touching electrical equipment as this can lead to electrocution. Should you find yourself surrounded by several feet of moving water, make your way to a higher floor as quickly and carefully as possible. Do not, however, go into your attic if there is no way out, and only go to the roof if you have no other choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtostaysafeafteraflood\">How to Stay Safe After a Flood</h2>\n<p>There are still dangers after the flood has receded. As much as possible, stay out of pools of water and mud. These may look safe, but water can be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. It can also be full of bacteria, and that can lead to serious health issues. Plus, moving water as shallow as six inches can sweep you off of your feet.</p>\n<p>Six inches of water can also cause you to lose control of your car, and two feet can carry away most sport utility vehicles, so don’t drive through deep pools of water. You should also know that floods erode roadways and bridges, and this may cause them to collapse under the weight of a car.</p>\n<p>Better yet? Stay off the streets as much as possible because disaster crews and emergency responders have to deal with the aftermath of the flood. If you must drive, keep to the middle of the road, the highest part, and follow all emergency signs.</p>\n<p>Emergency authorities also recommend staying out of buildings that are surrounded by water because they can be dangerous. You don’t know what the water has done to the foundation and the building may collapse. It’s best to wait until the water subsides before re-entering.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, continue to listen to emergency alerts in case more flooding is on the way. Do not return to your home until for the authorities to tell you it is safe to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cleaningupaftertheflood\">Cleaning Up After the Flood</h2>\n<p>Experts recommend waiting for the water to go down before reentering your home. Once you can enter your home safely, make sure you have rubber boots, waterproof gloves, and an N95 mask to protect yourself. You should also turn off the electricity in your home if you weren’t able to prior to evacuating. But remember, don’t touch electric appliances if they are wet or if you’re standing in water.</p>\n<p>Other important clean-up steps include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checking for gas and water leaks:</strong> You’ll want to address these before anything else to prevent further damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Drying out your house:</strong> Your goal is to dry out your home within 24 hours to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prevent-mold-after-a-flood/\">prevent mold growth</a> and to limit damage to walls, floors, and foundations. If there’s oil on the water, hire an environmental contractor to remove it before you pump out the water.</li>\n<li><strong>Disinfecting your belongings: Remember that the water is likely contaminated so you need to sanitize any items you decide to keep.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is also a good time to take pictures of the damage and contact your insurer to begin the claims process. They’ll send an insurance adjuster to assess your claim, but be patient as there may be many people needing help.</p>\n<p>Devastating floods can happen in an instant, leaving you little time to get out safely. Preparation is the key to surviving while also minimizing damage to your property.</p>\n<p>For more tips, check out “<a href=\"/blog/5-things-to-do-after-a-flood/\">5 Things to Do After a Flood</a>.”</p>"

      title: "Additional Living Expenses Examples"
      body: "<p>Additional living expenses coverage, sometimes called loss of use coverage, is offered under Coverage D in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policy. It can help pay for out-of-pocket costs like a hotel, excess transportation, and more when you can't live at home because of a covered claim.</p>\n<p>But when exactly does that coverage kick in? Does your home have to be totally destroyed for your insurance company to pay for additional living expenses? What if an event in your neighborhood forces a mandatory evacuation? Let’s look at a few additional living expenses examples to get a better idea of how this coverage works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additionallivingexpensesexamples\">Additional Living Expenses Examples</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Coverage D</a> typically only kicks in when your home is made uninhabitable by a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> that’s covered by your home insurance policy. That said, there are numerous examples of when you might tap into your additional living expenses coverage, including when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You need to find temporary lodging during a claim:</strong> Let’s say a kitchen fire gets out of control. As a result, your home is unsafe to live in. Most insurance companies would cover the additional living expense of temporary housing.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re unable to use part of your home:</strong> Now imagine that kitchen fire only requires your kitchen to be gutted and rebuilt. You can stay in the house, but you can’t cook there until the kitchen is redone. In this case, you may be able to file a claim to cover the costs of eating out.</li>\n<li><strong>Civil authority requires you to evacuate due to a cause of loss covered under your policy:</strong> Additional living expenses are sometimes triggered if a civil authority like the police or emergency management service prohibits you from staying in your home. This is only available if neighboring properties suffer direct physical damage that is covered under your policy and that is the reason the civil authority is prohibiting you from returning home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional living expense coverage often depends on how your insurer defines “uninhabitable.” Conditions of coverage may also vary. For example, if the insurer finds temporary housing that has a kitchen, then dining out is often not a covered expense. So be sure to ask your insurance provider for some additional living expenses examples for your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcaniuseadditionallivingexpensesfor\">What Can I Use Additional Living Expenses For?</h2>\n<p>A claim that causes you to have to move out of your home can be stressful, and racking up unexpected expenses can add to the overwhelm. The good news is that loss of use protection is designed to take some of that worry off your plate.</p>\n<p>Additional living expense coverage can potentially pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary accommodations, such as a hotel, Airbnb, or apartment.</li>\n<li>Extra transportation costs.</li>\n<li>Pet boarding if necessary.</li>\n<li>Reasonable restaurant bills if you are unable to cook.</li>\n<li>Relocation and storage of personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Laundry expenses.</li>\n<li>Parking fees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional expense coverage also includes <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a> that's important to know if you rent out a portion of your home. Fair rental value coverage can reimburse you for lost rent if a covered claim makes the rental portion of your home uninhabitable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongdoadditionalexpenseslast\">How Long Do Additional Expenses Last?</h2>\n<p>Every insurance policy is different, but most <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> state that additional living expense payments are paid only for the shortest time required to repair damage or for you to relocate if relocation is necessary – usually about 12 months. Homeowners who rent out space in their homes get just two weeks of rent replacement if there’s a mandatory evacuation as explained above. Additionally, policies have a limit to the amount of money available for additional use expenses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filinganadditionalexpensesclaim\">Filing an Additional Expenses Claim</h2>\n<p>Your insurance company doesn’t simply write you a check for your additional expenses. In fact, insurers only reimburse you for the money you spend above and beyond your normal living expenses. This means you need to document all of your costs by providing rental agreements, gas receipts, restaurant receipts, and any other bill you incur while you’re unable to live in your home. Your claims representative may provide a worksheet to categorize and track your expenses.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the additional living expenses won’t cover all costs while you are displaced – only additional costs. It won’t pay for your mortgage, your regular grocery bill, or your kids’ tennis lessons. Those are your normal budgeted expenses and still your responsibility while displaced.</p>\n<p>Plus, your insurance company may deduct money you save while you’re not in your home. For example, say your utility bills are lower at your temporary residence than what you normally pay. Your insurer may subtract those savings from your additional expenses payment.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, remember that additional expenses generally only kick in for <a href=\"/blog/which-disasters-are-covered/\">covered disasters</a> that make your home unlivable. If you’re unsure about what triggers your coverage, be sure to, talk to your insurance provider.</p>"

      title: "When to Get Your Home Reappraised"
      body: "<p>Do you know how much your home is worth? We’re not talking about what you paid for your home – that value has probably changed. Home improvements, a new neighborhood school, and even your landscaping can affect your home’s value.</p>\n<p>Getting your home reappraised is the only way to know what your home is currently worth. Of course, this information is only useful for certain situations. A good rule of thumb is to get your home reappraised when you’re considering making a major life change that involves <a href=\"/faq/trust-owned-home-insurance/\">your home</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the financial, home-related, and external reasons to get your home reappraised.</p>\n<h2 id=\"financialreasonsforahomereappraisal\">Financial Reasons for a Home Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a reappraisal makes sense when you’re about to make a big financial decision. For example, you might get your home reappraised when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You want to sell your home.</strong> A home reappraisal can help you determine the <a href=\"/blog/virtual-stage-your-home/\">listing price</a>. During the appraisal process, your home is typically compared to <a href=\"http://homeguides.sfgate.com/reasons-getting-house-appraisal-1201.html\">homes in your neighborhood</a> with comparable square footage, bathrooms, and other structures, like fencing and sheds. The appraiser then adds or subtracts value depending on additions or faults that don’t appear in comparable homes. Install new piping? Great! Is your home missing an extra closet or two? That may take away from its overall value.</li>\n<li><strong>You want to refinance or get a home equity loan.</strong> If you want to refinance your mortgage, your lender will likely require a home reappraisal. Home equity loans are also based on the value of your home. If you’ve made improvements to your home that add to its value, that can help you out when you refinance your mortgage, for example, if you have an FHA loan and you’re still paying mortgage insurance. Once you have home equity of 20 percent, the lender will often drop the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-mortgage-insurance-and-how-does-it-work-en-1953/\">mortgage insurance requirement</a>, which saves you money each month.</li>\n<li><strong>You want to take out another type of loan.</strong> When it comes to some loan application processes, such as for business or car loans, you may need to put up your home as collateral. In these cases, the lender may require you to get your home reappraised to understand its current value. You’d show the appraisal documentation to the lender to move forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"homerelatedreasonsforreappraisal\">Home-Related Reasons for Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>Updates to the home can increase its value. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In-home repairs.</strong> These may include removing chipped paint, fixing loose floorboards, and updating old fixtures. Many of these are <a href=\"/blog/10-diy-home-projects/\">simple DIY projects</a> you can tackle over a weekend. Keep in mind that appraisers also check installed home devices during inspection, so test your carbon monoxide, home security, and smoke alarms, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Large home Improvement and renovation projects.</strong> Appraisers typically value homes in $500 increments. If you’re considering a repair that will cost more than this amount, consider getting your home appraised afterward. For example, large outdoor projects like new landscaping or a new walkway may impact the home’s value, as well as indoor projects like new tiles, new carpet, or windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>G. Stacy Sirmans, real estate professor at Florida State University, recommends that homeowners start with minor improvements to the bathroom and kitchen. He also says that wood flooring, landscaping, and an enclosed garage can drive up appraisal values.</p>\n<p>It also helps to document the improvements with before and after photos. You can show these to your home appraiser to help them make a more accurate estimation of the value these renovations created.</p>\n<h2 id=\"externalfactorsforahomereappraisal\">External Factors for a Home Reappraisal</h2>\n<p>These factors that are outside your control can impact the value of your home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Changes in the neighborhood.</strong> If your neighbors update their houses to add curb appeal, people may pay more to live there.</li>\n<li><strong>Road upgrades.</strong> Updated infrastructure can make a location more appealing to future homebuyers.</li>\n<li><strong>New schools.</strong> Young families may be attracted to areas with nearby schools.</li>\n<li><strong>New local amenities.</strong> The opening of nearby parks, stores, and community centers can make your area more attractive on the housing market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"findingahomeappraiser\">Finding a Home Appraiser</h2>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to do your own research to get a better feel of your neighborhood’s value. Talk to your neighbors about their own home appraisals and what factors the appraiser noted. Home appraisals are often on public record, too.</p>\n<p>Ideally, your home appraiser should live within a 10-mile radius of your home so they are familiar with the area. If they aren’t, don’t be afraid to explain to your home appraiser the selling points of your neighborhood. This may help prevent your home from being undervalued.</p>\n<h2 id=\"willareappraisalincreaseyourhomeinsurancepremium\">Will a Reappraisal Increase Your Home Insurance Premium?</h2>\n<p>A reappraisal will tell you the value of your home, but that isn’t what the cost of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a> is based on. Home insurance companies consider the replacement cost of your home when offering and pricing your coverage. The replacement cost is how much it would be to rebuild your home with similar, new materials. This figure doesn’t take into account the intangibles that make your home appealing to, say, potential homebuyers (such as a good school district or local amenities).</p>\n<p>So regardless of whether your home increases or decreases in value, your reappraisal typically won’t impact your home insurance premiums. However, if your home increases in value because you remodeled the kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances, you should <a href=\"/blog/when-to-call-home-insurance-company/\">give your home insurance company a call</a>. You want to make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> is still appropriate if you ever need to repair or replace those shiny new items.</p>"

      body: "<p>People often buy home insurance and then forget about it. They pay their policy premium the same time they pay their mortgage bill and don’t think about it again. Unfortunately, that means they risk being either underinsured or paying for more coverage than they actually need.</p>\n<p>You most likely need to review your coverage whenever you have a major change in your situation. Here are several instances when you may need to update your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1youjustfinishedarenovation\">1. You Just Finished a Renovation.</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> on your homeowners policy is based on your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimate</a> (i.e., what it costs to rebuild your home), and a major renovation or remodeling project can change that amount. For example, you may want to review your home insurance if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade your flooring to hardwood.</li>\n<li>Add square footage.</li>\n<li>Finish your basement.</li>\n<li>Improve your cabinets or countertops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">our handy guide</a> to get a rough estimate of how much dwelling coverage you need after a renovation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2youbroughtanewdoghome\">2. You Brought a New Dog Home.</h2>\n<p>Bringing a dog into your home is a great idea, but it can affect your homeowners insurance. In fact, you can’t assume your insurance company covers your dog at all. Many companies have <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted breed lists</a> that make it difficult for some dog owners to get covered. If your dog is on that list, your insurer may not pay claims relating to dog bites or other damage your dog causes.</p>\n<p>Even if your insurance company does cover your dog, it may charge a higher premium. You might also want to update the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> in your homeowners insurance to make sure you have enough to cover the additional risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3youpurchasedsomethingexpensive\">3. You Purchased Something Expensive.</h2>\n<p>Big-ticket items like a new television or expensive furniture may mean you need to review how much <a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">personal property coverage</a> you have. If you don’t have enough for the new items, you’ll want to increase your coverage limits as soon as possible to protect against loss. Certain high-value items such as jewelry or fine art may require a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4youaddedaswimmingpool\">4. You Added a Swimming Pool.</h2>\n<p>A swimming pool may increase the amount of dwelling coverage you need, but it can also mean you need additional liability coverage. Insurance professionals call swimming pools and similar items “<a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisances</a>” because they often invite trouble. Other examples of attractive nuisances include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trampolines.</li>\n<li>Tree houses.</li>\n<li>Playground equipment.</li>\n<li>Water features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can be held responsible if a child is injured by these or similar items, so you may want higher liability limits if you install one or something similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Swimming pools sometimes fall under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5youinstalledasecuritysystem\">5. You Installed a Security System.</h2>\n<p>Installing a security system can help you sleep better at night, but you should also call your insurance agent once it’s in. Many home insurance companies offer discounts for home monitoring and security systems, burglar alarms, and deadbolts or smart locks. Some even offer discounts if you live in a gated community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6yougotawatershutoffdevice\">6. You Got a Water Shut-Off Device.</h2>\n<p>A water shut-off device is another good way to earn a homeowners insurance discount. These devices can automatically turn off the water supply to your house when they detect leaks. Water flow sensors can have similar shut-off features that catch irregular flow through your pipes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7youboughtanewroof\">7. You Bought a New Roof.</h2>\n<p>As your roof ages, it becomes more prone to damage, and that means you’re more likely to file a claim. Your insurance company accounts for this risk by charging a higher premium. But you often see a better rate once you install a roof. You may even see lower homeowners insurance costs if you retrofit your current roof with wind mitigation features like <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8youstartedahomebusiness\">8. You Started a Home Business.</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners policies offer limited coverage for business equipment, so you may have enough insurance if you don’t have a lot of inventory or specialized equipment. That said, liability claims related to a home-based business are almost always excluded. You may be able to fix that with an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a>, but you might also need a separate commercial insurance policy. Either way, starting a business is a good time to review what is (and can be) covered by your home policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9yourentedoutyourhome\">9. You Rented Out Your Home.</h2>\n<p>Once you decide to rent your home, you become a landlord and that usually means you need <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>. That’s an altogether different type of policy than your homeowners policy, but it’s important to make the change because your risks changed. For example, your liability risk increases because you can’t control the activity that goes on or guests that go into your home when it isn’t your dwelling.</p>\n<p>Landlord insurance also covers the dwelling, other structures, and any personal property you leave on site to service the home. Your tenant’s property, however, is not covered. Policy also may have coverage for unoccupied spaces and for your <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">rental income</a>.</p>"

      title: "Which Disasters Are Covered?"
      body: "<p>This year has been a busy one for natural disasters. Around the United States, bad weather and bad luck have caused billions of dollars in damage. As a homeowner, you probably hear about these events and wonder: would my <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> cover me for that?</p>\n<p>Let's look at some recent disasters and break down what your home insurance would likely cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverhurricanes\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Hurricanes?</h2>\n<p>Hurricanes Florence and Michael battered the eastern United States in late summer, and Hurricane Willa made landfall in October, bringing heavy rain to parts of Texas and Mexico. This makes two consecutive years of seriously damaging hurricanes, and climate scientists agree that this is our new normal.</p>\n<p>So how can you expect your homeowners insurance to behave if you're caught in the path of a hurricane?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wind damage from hurricanes is typically covered</strong>. We tend to think of <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> in terms of water, but they’re also known for high winds. If those winds damage your property (e.g., by ripping off <a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\">roof shingles</a>), your home insurance will likely pay for necessary repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Flood damage is not covered</strong>. Homeowners insurance doesn’t offer coverage for water that comes in from outside your home. For that, you’ll need a separate <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just as important as having the right policies, though, is making sure your property is ready to withstand extreme weather. Check out our tips on <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">prepping your home for hurricanes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gasexplosionsfiresaretypicallycovered\">Gas Explosions: Fires Are Typically Covered</h2>\n<p>In September, several homes in Massachusetts caught fire (and a few residents died) when their gas lines exploded because pressure in the pipelines was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pressure-massachusetts-gas-explosions-was-12-times-higher-normal-n910581\">12 times higher than it was supposed to be</a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously, home insurance can’t do anything to fix the tragedy of lost life. But it can respond to other parts of this incident:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire damage is typically covered</strong>. Fires are a covered peril in nearly every homeowners insurance policy, so homeowners can likely make a claim to repair any damage caused by fires the explosions sparked.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use is usually covered</strong>. In cases where a home becomes uninhabitable because of a covered peril, homeowners insurance can typically pay for the residents to live somewhere else until their home is livable again. In the case of the gas explosions, thousands of residents had their gas turned off while the gas company made repairs – meaning no heat, hot water, or cooking gas. Most residents have reportedly opted to live elsewhere, especially as the winter approaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this situation, the gas company is apparently paying for some of these costs (including, in some cases, temporary housing). Regardless of the details of the incident, though, an insurance provider may attempt to recover some expenses from a responsible party (like the gas company), if there is one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"volcanoeruptionslavaisntcovered\">Volcano Eruptions: Lava Isn't Covered</h2>\n<p>In May, a volcano in Hawaii <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/07/636416200/hawaii-volcano-quiets-after-months-long-eruption\">erupted</a>, wiping out roads and entire communities in its wake. But the residents affected by the spewing lava are still living with the consequences. Here’s what their home insurance likely did and did not cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fires and ash-related damage may be covered</strong>. Again, fires are a covered peril in most policies, even if they’re started by a volcano. So a typical policy may pay for damage related to a volcano-ignited fire. It may also pay for removal of ash, which can gather in homes near an eruption.</li>\n<li><strong>Lava flow and other “earth movements” are not covered</strong>. Typical homeowners policies exclude “earth movement,” which is often interpreted as earthquakes, but also includes mudflow and lava flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you live in an area with active volcanoes, contact your insurance provider about additional coverage that would protect you in the event of an eruption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wildfiresandmudslidesitreallydepends\">Wildfires and Mudslides: It Really Depends</h2>\n<p>As of October, wildfires had burned <a href=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm\">more than eight million acres</a> of land in the United States in 2018, and that number is even higher now due to the latest wildfires in California. While homeowners insurance usually covers damage from fires, some homeowners in wildfire-heavy areas may not have this coverage (or may pay a high premium for it). Check your policy when in doubt.</p>\n<p>Also worth noting: Mudslides common in some parts of the country are usually not covered. As with volcanoes, homeowners at risk for “earth movement” may want to seek alternate coverage or invest in infrastructure that could help prevent damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectingyourhomeinadisaster\">Protecting Your Home in a Disaster</h2>\n<p>One of the worst feelings a homeowner can have is finding out that damage to their home is not covered by their policy. Protecting your home starts with understanding the ins and outs of your policy – and shoring it up with additional insurance, if necessary.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the importance of prevention: even the best insurance in the world can’t prevent bad things from happening – and in the case of natural disasters, neither can you. But you can take steps today to <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-proof-your-home/\">make your home safer</a> and more resilient for the events most likely to affect you.</p>"

      title: "FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Increase Coming"
      body: "<p>Homeowners who get their flood insurance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may see their premiums go up starting on April 1, 2022﹘that is, if they haven’t seen rates increase already. The agency announced a change to its rating system late last year and has been rolling it out ever since.</p>\n<p>The result? Approximately 82 percent of single family homeowners insured through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) have seen or will see flood insurance rate increases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewillnfipfloodinsuranceratesincreasethemost\">Where Will NFIP Flood Insurance Rates Increase the Most?</h2>\n<p>FEMA has provided an {{< external-link url=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/44d08581aaf14f39bc0da5d02f378007\" text=\"interactive map\" >}}, developed by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Association of State Floodplain Managers, to help homeowners identify if their property will see a rate increase. Highlights include NFIP flood insurance rate increases for approximately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>89 percent of Texas single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>88 percent of Florida single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>87 percent of Mississippi single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>85 percent of Alabama single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>83 percent of Louisiana single family homeowners.</li>\n<li>80 percent of South Carolina single family homeowners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners in coastal states will likely be hit hardest by the flood insurance rate increase caused by Risk Rating 2.0. This is partly due to the annual hurricane season that generates significant rain and storm surge that make these properties extremely susceptible to flooding. However, floods can happen anywhere it rains, so in reality, <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">flood insurance is for everyone</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a deeper look at exactly what this new rollout is about and how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyarefemafloodinsuranceratesgoingup\">Why Are FEMA Flood Insurance Rates Going Up?</h2>\n<p>The main reason FEMA’s flood insurance rates are going up is because the agency has overhauled the way it sets prices. Called {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating\" text=\"Risk Rating 2.0\" >}}, the new methodology applies what FEMA describes as cutting-edge technology to current flood maps in hopes of creating premiums that better represent policyholders’ actual risk.</p>\n<p>FEMA’s previous rating methodology, which had not been updated since the 1970s, focused on a property’s elevation within a given flood zone as outlined on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). But under that system, certain communities paid more than their fair share of flood insurance premium.</p>\n<p>Risk Rating 2.0 takes into account new ways of understanding flood risk through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private sector data sets.</li>\n<li>Improved catastrophe models.</li>\n<li>Advanced actuarial practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, the new rating methodology reduces rates in areas with less risk for flooding and increases them for areas where floods are more likely. That’s why FEMA refers to Risk Rating 2.0 as “equity in action.”</p>\n<p>The rollout for Risk Rating 2.0 began on October 1, 2021 for new policies and policies up for renewal. Starting on April 1, 2022, the remaining policies will be subject to the new rating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatriskrating20isnotchanging\">What Risk Rating 2.0 Is Not Changing</h2>\n<p>Even though its rating system is changing, FEMA is keeping some elements, particularly those that are required by law. Perhaps the most important of these is the maximum annual price increase of 18 percent for most rates. Flood insurance rate increases will be gradual and always within the mandatory 18 percent cap where it applies.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the FEMA insurance program that won’t change is the use of FIRMs to determine who is required to buy <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. FIRMs will also continue to be used to develop floodplain management building requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, areas that participate in the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management/community-rating-system\" text=\"Community Rating System\" >}} will still be eligible for discounts between 5 and 45 percent based on the community’s classification. Because Risk Rating 2.0 doesn’t use <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a> to determine flood risk, the discounts will be applied uniformly to all policyholders within the community. This means homeowners in Special Flood Hazard Areas may also qualify for discounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidnfipfloodinsurancerateincreases\">How to Avoid NFIP Flood Insurance Rate Increases</h2>\n<p>The most important step you can take to avoid a flood insurance rate increase is to pay attention to your policy’s expiration date. NFIP policies do not automatically renew. Instead, the NFIP sends a renewal notice by mail, and then you contact the entity that sold you your policy. The notice should include any changes to your premium.</p>\n<p>If your renewal notice indicates a significant increase, then you may want to start shopping for private flood insurance. We suggest getting several quotes so you can compare what’s available from private flood insurance providers to the NFIP’s renewal terms.</p>\n<p>For example, you may want to check out our flood insurance endorsement that you can add to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Premiums start at just $175 per year, and the coverage limits are higher than what an NFIP policy usually offers.</p>"

      title: "Florida homeowners insurance rates going up"
      body: "<p>Florida regularly sits near the top of the list when it comes to home insurance costs. The average annual premium in the state is over $4,000 – or nearly three times the national average, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III).</p>\n<p>That’s enough to create serious sticker shock if you’re a first-time buyer, but Floridians may feel even more dismay come renewal time. The III also reports the average percentage increase for home insurance across the state is 30%.</p>\n<p>Please note that {{< external-link url=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/ica/2022propertyinsurancechanges\" text=\"recent special legislative sessions\" >}} addressed several of the issues Florida’s property insurance market faces. We hope these new laws will provide our Florida homeowners some relief from the rising cost of insurance. However, the impact might not be felt immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howarehomeownersinsuranceratesdeterminedinflorida\">How are homeowners insurance rates determined in Florida?</h2>\n<p>As a member-owned insurance company, we want our policyholders to understand what goes into determining fair rates. Some of the laws governing insurance rates in Florida are unique and strict. For example, Florida property insurers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can’t just charge whatever rates they want.</li>\n<li>Can’t exceed a maximum profit of 4.2%.*</li>\n<li>Must set rates that cover reinsurance costs and the number of claims they expect.</li>\n<li>Must get any proposed rate changes approved by Florida’s insurance regulator.</li>\n<li>Must prove that any requested rate change is fair and necessary.**</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also strive to meet our members’ needs by providing home insurance at as low a price as possible while still ensuring we have the financial ability to pay claims and serve our members for years to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatscausingfloridahomeownersinsuranceratestoincrease\">What’s causing Florida homeowners insurance rates to increase?</h2>\n<p>The reasons Florida homeowners insurance rates are going up are complex, but they all point to one general culprit: rising costs. Insurance companies exist to protect customers from the high cost of a devastating loss. But over time their rates have to be higher than their costs, or the insurance companies wouldn't have any capital left.</p>\n<p>In fact, several well-known insurance companies have already gone insolvent or stopped selling home insurance in Florida because of this struggle, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FedNat Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>St. Johns Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>United Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Gulfstream Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Southern Fidelity Insurance Company.</li>\n<li>Bankers Insurance Group.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what’s happening in Florida that pushes home insurance rates so high? The reasons are complicated, but we’ve broken them down into five categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinsurance</li>\n<li>Insurance fraud</li>\n<li>Litigation costs</li>\n<li>Catastrophic claims</li>\n<li>Inflation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just about every state has issues with each of these to some extent, but Florida is currently struggling with all of them. Combine these with <a href=\"faq/home-insurance-fees/\">fees assessed by the Florida Insurance Guarantee Association</a> (FIGA) in October 2021 and May 2022, and you can see why Florida homeowners insurance rates are on the rise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reinsurancerisingforall\">Reinsurance rising for all</h2>\n<p>The most important factor contributing to Florida’s rising home insurance rates are recent {{< external-link url=\"https://www.artemis.bm/news/reinsurance-rates-need-to-catch-up-at-june-july-2022-renewals/\" text=\"increases in reinsurance costs\" >}}. Essentially insurance for an insurance company, <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance-definition/\">reinsurance</a> is a necessary part of an insurer’s ability to pay claims ﹘ particularly in catastrophe-prone states like Florida. But sometimes the cost of reinsurance goes up, and when it does, so will homeowners insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>Reinsurance cost went down between 2006 and 2017, in part because there weren’t many major storms in Florida. But recently, bigger storms have caused bigger losses, and that’s caused the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.artemis.bm/global-property-cat-rate-on-line-index/\" text=\"cost of reinsurance to increase\" >}}. In just the first part of January, reinsurance rates in the U.S. went up between {{< external-link url=\"https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20230110/NEWS06/912354781/Property-insurance-rates-to-keep-surging-in-2023\" text=\"45% and 100%\" >}}. That’s a cost home insurance companies have to cover when they set their rates.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Florida legislature passed bills to create the Reinsurance to Assist Policyholders Fund (RAP Fund) and the {{< external-link url=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Committees/BillSummaries/2022A/html/2878\" text=\"Florida Optional Reinsurance Program\" >}} (FORA). The RAP Fund provides some reinsurance to insurers for free, but only in either 2022 or 2023. FORA, on the other hand, is an optional program that lets insurers purchase coverage at reasonable rates. However, the amount of coverage from these programs is limited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcatastrophicclaimsimpactfloridahomeownersinsurancerates\">How catastrophic claims impact Florida homeowners insurance rates</h2>\n<p>More catastrophic claims cause reinsurance costs to rise, but they also directly impact the <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a>. Essentially, Florida insurance companies must price policies so that they have enough money to cover claims expected from catastrophic losses such as hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Because Florida has the highest risk of catastrophe of any state, <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> typically costs more than the national average. And unfortunately, climate change <a href=\"/blog/climate-change-report-2021/\">causes more severe hurricanes</a>. This increases the chance of lots of homeowners experiencing claims all at once, forcing home insurance companies to raise rates to cover the potential claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurancefraudandhomeinsuranceratesinflorida\">Insurance fraud and home insurance rates in Florida</h2>\n<p>While increasing reinsurance costs is the main driver of Florida’s home insurance rate increases, litigation costs are another issue Florida insurance companies have to contend with when pricing <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. And that problem is compounded by fraud, particularly insurance scams involving <a href=\"/glossary/assignment-of-benefits/\">assignments of benefits</a> (AOB) and repairs. The scenarios usually go like this:</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario1manufactureddamage\">Scenario 1: Manufactured damage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A contractor sends a solicitation or knocks on an insured’s door saying that he or she has been able to get a “free new roof” for neighbors in the area and they’d like to inspect the insured’s roof</li>\n<li>The contractor goes on the roof and creates “damage” with a hammer or other method</li>\n<li>The contractor tells the insured that they have damage from a prior storm and that the contractor can get them a new roof from the insurance company</li>\n<li>The contractor submits an insurance claim</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"scenario2inflateddamage\">Scenario 2: Inflated damage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A homeowner calls a contractor to fix roof damage.</li>\n<li>The contractor has the homeowner sign an assignment of benefits contract that allows the contract to manage the claim directly with the insurer.</li>\n<li>The contractor inflates the cost of repairs and sues the insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“The cost of bad actors and third parties filing false or inflated insurance claims is passed along to all of us,” according to Florida’s Insurance Consumer Advocate. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates insurance fraud costs over {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud\" text=\"$40 billion per year\" >}}. That translates into approximately $700 to $800 in increased annual premium per family.</p>\n<p>And there’s no free lunch when it comes to insurance fraud – the cost almost always gets passed on to homeowners. That’s why we ask our members to help mitigate rate increases by contacting us directly if they have a claim and avoiding attempts by third parties to generate or inflate claims.</p>\n<p>In the December 2022 special session, Florida legislators {{< external-link url=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/ica/2022propertyinsurancechanges\" text=\"passed a law\" >}} that could help reduce instances of insurance fraud. Senate Bill 2A (SB 2A) prohibits the assignment of benefits signed on or after January 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>But that date means claims from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole aren’t affected. Those claims are still coming in, so insurers may still be paying for AOB-related insurance fraud.</p>\n<p>The May 2022 special session also brought about a law designed to reduce fraud. Senate Bill 4D (SB 4D) intends to curb contractors’ ability to solicit policyholders by prohibiting contractors from encouraging policyholders to contact a contractor or public adjuster to make a roof claim unless the communication includes the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The policyholder is responsible for paying the deductible.</li>\n<li>It’s insurance fraud for the contractor to pay or waive an insurance deductible.</li>\n<li>Filing a claim with false, misleading, or fraudulent information is insurance fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"litigationcostspassedontopolicyholders\">Litigation costs passed on to policyholders</h2>\n<p>Ever wonder why Florida has so many attorney advertisements on television and billboards that are focused specifically on suing insurance companies? Until the special session this past December, Florida’s incredibly high rate of insurance litigation was driven by a unique Florida law.</p>\n<p>The law, F.S. sec 627.428, created a situation of “one-way attorney fees.” Basically, plaintiff attorneys were rewarded for filing lawsuits against insurance companies without any counterbalancing risk that these attorneys could owe legal costs if their lawsuits are unsuccessful. Because of this, Florida had {{< external-link url=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2021/04/14/609721.htm\" text=\"over 76% of home insurance lawsuitst\" >}}, but only 8% of homeowners claims.</p>\n<p>Worse? Between 2013 and 2020, Florida property and casualty insurers paid $15 billion in claims costs, but only {{< external-link url=\"https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/12/28/florida-personal-lines-coverage-reaches-crisis-levels-part-1/\" text=\"8% of that went to consumers\" >}}. Lawyers fees, however, accounted for 71%.</p>\n<p>SB 2A repeals one-way attorney fees. Each party is now responsible for their own attorney fees in many property insurance lawsuits, with a few exceptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inflationhitseveryone\">Inflation hits everyone</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest factors in determining the insurance rate for an individual home is the amount of money it would take to replace that home if it were destroyed. This is currently being significantly impacted by inflation.</p>\n<p>The supply chain issues that plague other industries also impact Florida homeowners insurance rates. Take the cost of lumber for an example. Limited supplies coupled with high demand <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">forced lumber prices to skyrocket in 2021</a>. In turn, those prices drove up homes’ <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimates</a>. And if your home costs more to replace, then your home insurance is going to cost more too.</p>\n<p>Between January 2021 and January 2022, residential reconstruction costs in Florida {{< external-link url=\"https://www.verisk.com/insurance/gated-resources/360value-quarterly-cost-updates/\" text=\"went up 12.4%\" >}} as of April, according to insurance software company Value360. While that’s not the highest in the country, it does add to increasing Florida homeowners insurance rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whataboutfiga\">What about FIGA?</h2>\n<p>Finally, Florida homeowners are also being hit with an additional fee from the Florida Insurance Guarantee Association (FIGA). This is the state-sanctioned organization dedicated to protecting insurance consumers in the event an <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> is unable to meet its obligations. To do this, FIGA periodically requires its members to collect fees from their policyholders.</p>\n<p>The current 1.3% assessment, ordered on March 11, 2022, is specifically linked to St. Johns Insurance Company entering into receivership, according to a {{< external-link url=\"https://figafacts.com/assessments\" text=\"statement put out by FIGA\" >}}. This is on top of a prior 0.70% fee assessed on October 11, 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcanhomeownersdotoreduceinsurancerates\">What can homeowners do to reduce insurance rates?</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, the Florida state government is looking to make home insurance more affordable. In the meantime, there are ways for you to reduce your homeowners insurance premiums. For instance, you might want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask for discounts.</strong> Every insurance carrier has its own list of discounts, so find out what your insurer offers so you can take advantage of as many as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Raise your deductible.</strong> Increasing your deductible often lowers your premium. However, you want to be sure you pick a deductible you can afford to pay.</li>\n<li><strong>Take part in My Safe Florida Home.</strong> This program, which was bolstered by SB 2D, provides homeowners with funds for hurricane mitigation inspections and home-strengthening improvements. You can see if you’re eligible at the {{< external-link url=\"https://mysafeflhome.com/\" text=\"My Safe Florida Home website\" >}}.</li>\n<li><strong>Install wind mitigation features.</strong> Even if you’re not eligible for My Safe Home Florida, you may want to look into hardening your home against wind damage. The right window coverings and roof ties can make a big difference in a storm and could earn you a discount.</li>\n<li><strong>Install security devices.</strong> Deterring crime is a good way to minimize claims, and that can help you lower your home insurance costs in the long run.</li>\n<li><strong>Call your insurance company first.</strong> Don’t fall prey to fraudulent contractors or other parties who may create or inflate a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Comparing rates from multiple insurance companies is also a good way to get affordable coverage. Just be sure you look at the entire offer, not just the price.

      title: "Why & how to perform sump pump maintenance | Kin Insurance"
      body: "<p>Just the thought of your home and belongings being destroyed by floodwater is enough to fill any homeowner with dread. But don’t worry! If you live in an area prone to storms and heavy rainfall, chances are you already have a crucial appliance in your home that’s got your back. Let us introduce you to the almighty sump pump.</p>\n<p>Sump pumps are devices placed at the lowest point of your house (typically a basement or crawlspace) and are designed to protect the foundation of your home and keep it from flooding. They use sensors to detect elevated water levels and move water away from your home through — you guessed it — an underground pump.</p>\n<p>Do sump pumps need maintenance? You bet they do! As you can imagine, this appliance is an essential part of keeping your home safe after storms or heavy rainfall. You need to keep this appliance in good working order, which means that regular sump pump servicing is crucial.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll discuss <em>why</em> upkeep is so important, as well as <em>how</em> to maintain sump pumps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theimportanceofregularsumppumpmaintenance\">The importance of regular sump pump maintenance</h2>\n<p>Sump pump maintenance, not to be confused with sewage pump maintenance, is crucial for a variety of reasons. If these pumps stop working correctly, your basement could flood and cause serious damage to your home.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the purpose your sump pump serves. Your sump pump also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protects your home’s foundation.</li>\n<li>Prevents paint and wallpaper from peeling.</li>\n<li>Improves circulation and air flow in basements.</li>\n<li>Protects basement appliances from corrosion, like washers, dryers and freezers.</li>\n<li>Reduces fungus growth in basements, like mold and mildew.</li>\n<li>Reduces insect infestations, like termites and millipedes.</li>\n<li>Checks a box for flood insurance coverage requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just some of the perks of a functioning sump pump! As you can see, regular maintenance is important, and you should invest in a sump pump inspection at least once per year. If you live in an area with frequent heavy rainfall or snow, you may need to schedule quarterly sump pump maintenance service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6sumppumpmaintenancetips\">6 sump pump maintenance tips</h2>\n<p>While having a professional come out for regular sump pit maintenance is crucial, there are also things you can do to make sure you’re staying on top of your sump pump’s health. Performing inspections yourself every three or four months can pinpoint problems before they morph into something much more severe.</p>\n<p>Here are six essential sump pump service and maintenance tips:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1knowyoursumppump\">1. Know your sump pump</h3>\n<p>Most people don’t know anything about sump pumps — and we don’t blame you! While you don’t need to know all the ins and outs of how your pump works, it may help to understand the basics so you can spot when something’s not right.</p>\n<p>The majority of the time, your sump pump is on standby, ready to jump into action. After heavy rainfall, groundwater from surrounding soil moves into the sump pit below your house and fills it with water. The sensors in your sump pump detect this pressure and rising water levels, and that activates your pump. It starts pumping the water out into a nearby storm drain or detention pond.</p>\n<p>There are two primary types of pumps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Submersible sump pumps</strong>, which can operate underwater so the motor will be positioned within the sump pit.</li>\n<li><strong>Pedestal sump pumps</strong>, which have the motor positioned above the pit and floor level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these differences, both kinds of sump pumps essentially function the same way and come with all the usual parts, ranging from the discharge pipe to the float switch.</p>\n<p>It also helps to know basic information about <em>your</em> specific sump pump, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your pump’s model and age.</li>\n<li>Where you can source replacement parts in an emergency.</li>\n<li>Any previously repaired issues you need to be aware of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sump pumps over seven years old are far more likely to experience problems than newer models. If you’ve purchased a new unit, make sure you have a physical and digital copy of the instruction manual. The instructions tell you how your pump works and this can give clues on what you need to watch out for. If you’re not sure which model you have, look for the model number on the motor. It will help you determine which pump you own and where to find a copy of an instruction manual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2performregulartests\">2. Perform regular tests</h3>\n<p>Just because you’re not a sump pump expert doesn’t mean you can’t learn to perform regular tests on your own. Trust us, when that huge storm hits, you’re going to want to make sure your sump pump is doing its job.</p>\n<p>It’s impossible to predict when water may begin to seep into your basement, so you want to make sure that your sump pump is functioning properly year-round. Luckily, testing this is pretty easy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the power is on and pour a small bucket of water into the sump pit.</li>\n<li>Monitor how the pump performs when it’s running and note any strange noises that could indicate a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it! Set yourself a reminder on your calendar to perform this test every month. If you know there’s a big storm coming, run the test a few times in the days before. It only takes a few minutes to do and it’s well worth it to save your home from permanent serious damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3recognizethesigns\">3. Recognize the signs</h3>\n<p>No one spends more time in your house than you do, which is why you’re the best person to monitor your sump pump. Knowing the most common signs of a problem is a key to good sump pump maintenance. You don’t need to know how to <em>fix</em> these problems, just how to <em>recognize</em> them so you can call in a professional.</p>\n<p>The most common signs of problems, and the issues they correspond to, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rattling or grinding.</strong> These noises occur due to damaged or jammed impellers. Other odd noises may indicate worn-out parts.</li>\n<li><strong>Excessive vibrations.</strong> If your motor is vibrating too much, the impeller could have become deformed or bent.</li>\n<li><strong>Turning on and off.</strong> The internal wiring may be damaged if your pump turns itself on and off randomly.</li>\n<li><strong>Oil leaks.</strong> Leaking oil typically indicates that your sump pump is coming to the end of its lifespan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of these problems may indicate that your pump needs professional maintenance. In some cases, a professional may even recommend replacing the pump entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4deepcleanyoursumppump\">4. Deep clean your sump pump</h3>\n<p>As with most things, you can extend the lifespan of your sump pump by cleaning it regularly. Cleanliness increases its efficiency and keeps it performing at full potential. You want to deep clean your sump pump and pit regularly.</p>\n<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch off the pump. This step is very important. Trying to clean your sump pump while it’s connected to its power source is dangerous!</li>\n<li>Ensure that nobody is using any home appliances that could lead to water draining into the pump’s pit, such as the dishwasher or washing machine.</li>\n<li>Take a garden hose and rinse out the pump. If there’s any caked debris, remove it with a putty knife or plastic scraper.</li>\n<li>Use a wet vacuum to remove excess water from your sump pit.</li>\n<li>Wait until the pump has fully dried before reattaching your discharge pipe and plugging it back in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also discover that regular cleaning can alleviate some of the troubling signs we mentioned before. While it isn’t always the case, sometimes all your pump needs is a good cleaning!</p>\n<h3 id=\"5keepyourequipmentcovered\">5. Keep your equipment covered</h3>\n<p>Make sure you have a fitted covering for your sump pump. Basements are magnets for lint, debris, and sediment that could fall into the sump pit. A fitted covering protects your equipment from these as well as insects, and moisture-related problems. Plus it can prevent radon from seeping into your home. The covering should fit perfectly over the top, with the only holes being for the wiring.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that putting a cover over the top doesn’t negate the need for regular cleaning, but it can make the job much easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6inspectthedischargeline\">6. Inspect the discharge line</h3>\n<p>The last step in sump pump maintenance is to inspect the discharge line. If water is draining slowly and your pump is working fine, you may have an issue with your drainage pipes. Carefully remove any blockages you can see. If the problem persists, then you need to call a professional.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectyourhomewithkininsurance\">Protect your home with Kin Insurance</h2>\n<p>Every homeowner knows that water damage is one of the most severe threats to your home’s foundation.

      title: "Why we chose Louisiana as our next stop"
      body: "<p>Have you noticed the electricity in the air? The birds singing with extra gusto? The Gulf sparkling brighter than usual?</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence. Today is a cause for celebration: {{< external-link url=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/kin<em>now</em>offering<em>homeowners</em>policies<em>in</em>louisiana/prweb17808298.htm\" text=\"Kin has officially arrived in Louisiana\" >}}!</p>\n<p>We built Kin back in 2016 with our hearts set on one goal: to change homeowners insurance for the better. Since then, we’ve prioritized serving states that need easy, affordable home insurance the most. Perhaps no one knows how important that mission is more than Louisiana homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywechoselouisianaasournextstop\">Why we chose Louisiana as our next stop</h2>\n<p>Louisiana is currently one of the most expensive states in the US for homeowners insurance, thanks to its history of hurricanes and its rapidly disappearing coastline. In fact, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes\" text=\"843,349 Louisiana single-family homes\" >}} are vulnerable to a Category 5 hurricane.</p>\n<p>We can’t change the weather, but we can change how insurance is done.</p>\n<p>Picture it: what if instead of ignoring increasingly severe weather for as long as possible, your insurance provider actually helped you prepare for the weather to come? What if instead of increasing prices exponentially, your insurance company got smarter with data and risk modeling to help you save money?</p>\n<p>That’s our whole approach: we use data and technology to make homeowners insurance work for you, not the other way around. The result? You can often save more on home insurance with Kin, even if your home usually has a hard time getting covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ourfavoritethingsaboutlouisiana\">Our favorite things about Louisiana</h2>\n<p>To celebrate our launch in the state, we asked our team to share their favorite things about Louisiana.

Even during COVID, Yardi Gras was in full swing, with more than 3,000 homes transformed into stationary “floats.”</li>\n<li><strong>The alligators.</strong> Louisiana has one of the highest alligator populations in the country: an estimated 2 million in the wild and another 300,000 on alligator farms.</li>\n<li><strong>The food.</strong> King cakes. Beignets. Barbeque. Gumbo, étouffée, jambalaya, and po’boys. We could go on, but now we’re hungry.</li>\n<li><strong>The sights.</strong> The French Quarter, Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, National WWII Museum, Avery Island Tabasco Museum, and Congo Square, to name a few.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"faqsaboutourlouisianahomeownersinsurance\">FAQs about our Louisiana homeowners insurance</h2>\n<p>At this point, we’re sure you’ve got all kinds of questions about what we do and how we make life easier for the homeowners we insure.

      title: "Wildfire Risk Predictions for 2022"
      body: "<p>Over 58,000 wildfires burned 7.1 million acres in the US in 2021, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. One year prior, a similar number of fires burned more than 10 million acres. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate we’re in for much of the same in 2022.</p>\n<p>Living in an area with wildfire risk means you need to take steps to protect your home and family. So let’s take a closer look at these reports and what you can do to be prepared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"predictionsforuswildfireseason2022\">Predictions for US Wildfire Season 2022</h2>\n<p>A report from Zesty.ai, {{< external-link url=\"https://content.zesty.ai/wildfire-season-overview-2022/#lp-pom-image-20\" text=\"A Data-Driven Conversation About Wildfire Risk in 2022\" >}}, claims that large areas of the US will have a wildfire season similar to 2020 and 2021 – two of the worst wildfire years on record. For example, California, the state with the lion’s share of wildfires, had a particularly devastating season in 2021 where wildfires destroyed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.5 million acres.</li>\n<li>3,629 structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The previous year, 2020, was even worse with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.3 million acres burned.</li>\n<li>11,116 structures destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drought patterns in California, the primary driver of wildfire risk, are nearly the same in 2022 as they were in 2020 and 2021. The report goes on to list several other states where drought increases the chance for wildfires to this year.</p>\n<p>Another report, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/accuweather-2022-us-wildfire-forecast/1178642\" text=\"this one from AccuWeather\" >}}, echoes the Zesty.ai predictions, anticipating an “intense” wildfire season that could see 68,000 to 72,000 fires and 8.1 to 8.3 million acres burned. In fact, wildfires had already burned more than 1.1 million acres as of May 3, 2022. That’s double the acreage burned by that date last year.</p>\n<p>Historically, wildfire season sits between the months of July and October, when vegetation is at its driest, and temperatures are at their peak. But as we’ve discussed in previous posts, experts now believe that <a href=\"/blog/wildfire-season-is-year-round/\">wildfire season is year-round</a> – especially in the drought-ridden states out West.</p>\n<h3 id=\"climatechangeandwildfireswhatstheconnection\">Climate Change and Wildfires: What’s the Connection?</h3>\n<p>The general consensus in the science community is that climate change is a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-climate-change/\" text=\"key factor in increasing wildfire risk\" >}}. The ideal situation for a wildfire includes hot temperatures, low soil moisture, and the presence of fuel (e.g., trees and shrubs). Climate change brings higher temperatures and more drought, and the dryer conditions make it easier for fires to start and harder to put out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherewildfireriskisgreatest\">Where Wildfire Risk Is Greatest</h2>\n<p>Areas with the worst drought conditions have the most wildfire risk. According to the Zesty.ai report, property owners in these states have the most concern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>California</li>\n<li>Oregon</li>\n<li>New Mexico</li>\n<li>Texas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the Accuweather report lists additional areas with increased wildfire risk, such as Southern Florida. Western Oklahoma, and parts of North and South Carolina.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeinsurancecoverwildfirerisk\">Does Home Insurance Cover Wildfire Risk?</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> usually covers wildfire risk. Depending on where you live and who your insurance company is, you may be required to create a foliage-free barrier between your home and the grass, trees, and shrubs that surround it. This <a href=\"/blog/defensible-space/\">defensible space</a>, which can be anywhere from 30 to 100 feet, helps reduce the chance of a fire spreading to your home.</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> do not cover wildfire risk in some areas. Moreover, some may adjust their underwriting of homes in wildfire zones if the risk continues to increase. This is why it’s important to review your home insurance every year to see if any changes affect your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprotectyourhomefromwildfires\">How to Protect Your Home from Wildfires</h2>\n<p>While your home insurance is there to protect you if you do experience a wildfire, you also want to prevent a loss in the first place. The first step is to create a defensible space which means you should <a href=\"/blog/brush-removal-for-fire-prevention/\">remove brush for fire prevention</a>.</p>\n<p>Another big problem for homes in wildfire areas are embers, so cover attic vents with a fine, metal mesh to prevent embers from entering. Open eaves can be a problem too. The eaves are the section of your roof that extends over the exterior walls. If you can see beams in the eaves, then embers can get caught in your eaves and start your house on fire. Debris in your gutters and on your roof can also increase your fire risk.</p>\n<p>Essentially, look around your home for places where embers might enter and seal them off. These and other <a href=\"/blog/fire-prevention-for-homeowners/\">fire prevention tips</a> can help keep your home and family safe.</p>"

      title: "Wildfires in Florida: How to Protect Your Home"
      body: "<p>Florida has had a rough start to spring this year with a barrage of wildfires hitting the state. As of March 11, 2022, the Sunshine State has witnessed nearly 70 wildfires that burned over 36,000 acres. The worst wildfires in Florida so far were three in the Panhandle that burned more than 34,000 acres together.</p>\n<p>Wildfires may not be the first risk people associate with Florida homes, but they are a historical issue in the state. Florida sees fires on a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.sjcemergencymanagement.com/wfdepth.html\" text=\"three- to five-year cycle\" >}}, partly due to the tropical atmosphere that puts the state at the top of the list for lightning strikes. Worse, the risk for wildfires may be increasing with climate change. One of the results of more severe hurricanes is more dead vegetation to act as wildfire fuel.</p>\n<p>While you can’t completely protect your home from a wildfire, you take steps to reduce your risk. That starts with fireproofing your home and ends with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> that helps you recover if your home is damaged in a wildfire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofireproofyourhomefromwildfires\">How to Fireproof Your Home from Wildfires</h2>\n<p>Let’s be clear: you can’t completely fireproof your home. That said, some homes are better prepared than others to withstand wildfires. Some ways you can better prepare your home for the worst-case scenario include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Installing a noncombustible roof.</strong> The American Society for Testing Methods is one organization that rates roofing materials. Class A denotes the most fire resistant and includes roof materials like concrete and clay tiles, flat or barrel-shaped tiles, and asphalt fiberglass composition shingles.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing eaves.</strong> Stand under the outer edge of your roof and check where it meets your home’s exterior. If you can see the rafter tails, then you may want to close your eaves with a noncombustible material.</li>\n<li><strong>Covering exterior vents.</strong> You can also prevent embers from getting inside your home by covering your exterior vents. Use metal wire mesh that is ⅛-inch or smaller, but also check with a contractor to make sure you aren’t restricting airflow.</li>\n<li><strong>Installing noncombustible exterior wall coverings.</strong> Just like your roof, you want your exterior walls to be fire resistant. Several <a href=\"/blog/house-siding-options/\">house siding options</a>, like metal sheeting, brick veneer, and stuccos, tend to resist fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Removing excess vegetation around the home.</strong> You want at least 30 feet of <a href=\"/blog/defensible-space/\">defensible space</a> between your house and brush. Gravel, brick, and concrete are good options for creating defensible space that reduces combustion risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing your gutters.</strong> We use this tip a lot, but keeping your gutters and roof free from debris like leaves and branches lowers the risk of your roof catching fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Enclosing your foundation.</strong> The <a href=\"/blog/types-of-foundations-for-homes/\">type of foundation</a> your home sits on can also protect against wildfires in Florida. Closing yours off can reduce your home’s exposure to embers. However, you want to weigh your chance for wildfire against your likelihood for floods and choose the foundation type that best protects against your biggest risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Making water accessible.</strong> An external sprinkler system with its own power source can protect your home if other water sources aren’t available. You might also want to invest in a garden hose that’s long enough to reach all parts of your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing out your windows.</strong> Single-pane windows are more likely to break when exposed to extreme heat, so opt for multi-pane windows, safety glass, or fireproof shutters.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps around exterior wall openings.</strong> Exterior walls often have holes for utility connections. Fill any gaps in these with fire-resistant caulk, mortar, or fire-protective expanding foam.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way to protect your home is to pay attention to the {{< external-link url=\"https://fireweather.fdacs.gov/wx/fdi-report.html\" text=\"wildfire risk\" >}} in your area. That way you can stay alert for any news that may impact your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverwildfiresinflorida\">Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Wildfires in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> covers damage to your home when it’s caused by wildfires. This is automatically part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures coverage</a>. Your policy also has <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> to help pay for damage to your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>But what happens if a wildfire in your area keeps you from returning to your home? How are those expenses covered?</p>\n<p>Whether that is covered depends on the situation. We’ve outlined a couple of examples below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your property is damaged to the extent that you can’t live in it, then you can file a claim for additional living expenses on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>If damage to your neighbor’s property and an authority, like the fire department, restricts access to your home, then you may receive approximately two weeks of civil authority coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should note, however, that evacuations prior to damage are not covered by your home insurance, even when a civil authority calls for it.</p>\n<p>If you’re concerned about wildfires in your area, talk to your Kin representative to make sure that you have enough coverage with your home insurance. Review your dwelling coverage, other structures, and personal belongings coverages to ensure that you have the right amount of if you experience a wildfire.</p>"

      title: "Will US homeownership rates increase in 2022?"
      body: "<p>The 2021 US homeownership rate {{< external-link url=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf\" text=\"sits at 65.4 percent\" >}}, about two percentage points lower than third quarter of 2020. It makes you wonder: what's in store for 2022?</p>\n<p>There are a lot of economic factors at play in that equation –&nbsp;rising interest rates, inflation, and home prices, to name a few – and early predictions say 2022 will see a {{< external-link url=\"https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/leading-economic-and-housing-experts-predict-multiple-fed-interest-rate-hikes-slowing-inflation-and-home-price-growth\" text=\"slight decrease in home sales as mortgage rates tick up\" >}}.</p>\n<p>But changes this year might make homeownership more accessible for some. In the summer of 2021, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae, started incorporating rental payments into its mortgage application. It believes this could help 17% of eligible first-time buyers qualify for a loan.</p>\n<p>The FHA also updated how it handles student loan debt and estimates that change will impact 45% of the first-time homebuyers who turn to it for loans.</p>\n<p>These changes may impact homeownership rates in 2022. Let's take a look at each in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fhaschangestostudentloandebt\">FHA’s changes to student loan debt</h2>\n<p>For years, the FHA required lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment as one percent of the outstanding balance if the loan wasn’t fully amortizing or in repayment. That requirement applied even to borrowers who were in approved forbearance or deferment and to those who had relatively small monthly payments under an income-based repayment plan.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this rule made it nearly impossible for many people carrying student loan debt to qualify for a mortgage. And it was particularly burdensome or people of color. According to the Education Data Initiative, Black college graduates owe on average {{< external-link url=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race\" text=\"$25,000 more\" >}} than their white counterparts.</p>\n<p>But the FHA’s new rule allows lenders to base their calculations on borrowers’ actual monthly student loan payments, which is often lower than one percent of the total balance.</p>\n<p>This opens the door for many who had an unfavorable debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and is more in line with the FHA’s mission to help more first-time homebuyers get into a home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fanniemaetouserentalpayments\">Fannie Mae to use rental payments</h2>\n<p>Much like people with student loans found it difficult to qualify for an FHA loan, renters with limited credit histories were often frustrated when looking for a mortgage from Fannie Mae.</p>\n<p>As Melissa Gasparek of Inlanta Mortgage explains, “Because landlords do not report rent payments to credit bureaus, even renters with a flawless track record of on-time rent payments weren’t seeing any effect on or benefit to their credit scores.”</p>\n<p>But in August, {{< external-link url=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners\" text=\"Fannie Mae announced\" >}} that if a first-time homebuyer has one year’s worth of on-time payments, they may now qualify for a home loan.</p>\n<p>The process begins when a lender submits the original loan application to its automated underwriting system. If the loan is not eligible, the system checks for a 12-month history of rental payments. If it finds evidence of this, the lender can get permission from the applicant to order an asset report from a Fannie Mae-approved vendor. That vendor then sends the new information to Fannie Mae, which may determine the customer is eligible for the loan.</p>\n<p>While this is a lengthy process, Fannie Mae estimates it can help 17% of originally ineligible borrowers get home loans. Moreover, using {{< external-link url=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rental-pay-history-should-be-used-assess-creditworthiness-mortgage-borrowers\" text=\"rental payments to predict mortgage performance\" >}} is another important step toward equity in the housing market. According to Fannie Mae, about 20% of the population has a limited credit history, and people of color are disproportionately represented in that group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingintothehomebuyingprocess\">Getting into the home buying process</h2>\n<p>Even with these changes, remember that <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage basics</a> still apply, and that includes meeting other loan requirements.</p>\n<p>For example, Dino DiNenna of {{< external-link url=\"https://www.hiltonheadrealtysales.com/\" text=\"Hilton Head Realty\" >}} reminds people that they still want to “carry a credit score of 580 and have a down payment of 3.5%” to secure an FHA loan. And you’ll want to have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less in most cases.</p>\n<p>Essentially, follow all the normal <a href=\"/blog/first-time-home-buyer-tips/\">first-time buyer tips</a>, such as working to improve your credit and eliminating as much debt as possible.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about how the new rules affect you, talk to your mortgage representative.</p>"

Let’s take a look at a few of Sean’s insights on these issues Florida homeowners brought up in his AMA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetroubledfloridahomeinsurancemarket\">The troubled Florida home insurance market</h2>\n<p>Far and away, the question that got the most attention during the AMA was “How soon will the entire homeowners insurance industry collapse because things are not looking good?”</p>\n<p>That’s an unsettling question, but it received 71 upvotes so people are clearly concerned about the situation in Florida.</p>\n<p>But there may be hope on the horizon. As Sean said, there’s a “huge incentive for everyone involved – politicians, regulators, insurance companies, consumers … to take action to avoid such a collapse.” More importantly, he thinks recent legislation, like {{< external-link url=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/Division/ICA/2022PropertyInsuranceChanges#2A\" text=\"Senate Bill 2A\" >}}, will be very helpful.</p>\n<p>While he’s confident these reforms will ultimately help Floridians, Sean believes that further work is necessary. He also expects prices to continue to increase and availability to remain stressed until the changes have had a chance to work.</p>\n<p>The reason? Both insurers and <a href=\"/glossary/reinsurance/\">reinsurers</a> need data before they can act. Insurance and reinsurance are businesses that require a lot of capital, and the investors who provide it need to know they can get a positive return over time.</p>\n<p>Right now, the cost of capital for an insurance company is approximately 10% – perhaps even higher because the financial markets are so messy. If returns in the market are below that, then companies will likely shrink or go out of business. Above it, and you can start to attract new capital and new companies into the market.</p>\n<p>All said, Sean remained optimistic about the possibility for improvement: “[T]here have been periods of distress in homeowners insurance, and Florida homeowners insurance, but society has always found a way through.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancepremiumsinflorida\">Home insurance premiums in Florida</h2>\n<p>High premiums for Florida homeowners insurance have been a problem for years now. Unfortunately, the combination of more extreme weather activity, increased losses across the state (largely the result of excessive litigation), and the cost of capital due to higher interest rates has created a “perfect storm” that pushes premiums even higher.</p>\n<p>One Redditor even noted their rates doubled after Hurricane Sally when they only had $2,800 in damage, and they said they paid $7,900 in total over four years prior with no claims.</p>\n<p>But as Sean pointed out, insurance premiums only consider your claims history to the extent it predicts your likelihood to file another claim. He explained that homeowners don’t have much control over the <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> that could cause a financial loss.</p>\n<p>“Your home could be hit by a hurricane, tornado, neighborhood fire, hailstorms, or earthquake and none of this would be in your control,” he said. “Given that these things are out of your control, your prior claims history plays no part on this portion of your premium’s calculation.”</p>\n<p>It’s also important to remember that the overall characteristics of a home play a big role in its insurance rates. The home’s location is important, but other factors come into play, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The type of home construction (e.g., concrete block versus wood).</li>\n<li>The home’s age.</li>\n<li>The roof’s age and type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Florida homeowners might feel better hearing that premium hikes aren’t their fault. But many are still frustrated with the high cost of insurance – like one Kin member who saw their premium go up by more than 100% at renewal time. That Redditor asked, “Is this a normal thing, for the first year to be essentially a bonus rate and bump up to a more normal rate from then on?”</p>\n<p>Sean assured the member that there aren’t different rates for new and renewal customers. Instead, the recent rate increase is a result of devastating storms that caused big jumps in both reinsurance and repair costs. Insurers are legally required to cover these expenses, so when they go up, so do premiums.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that “it personally feels really awful to raise rates on our members, especially because we have no choice … because our costs have increased. I interact with members who are frustrated every single day, and it stinks.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingcostsdownforfloridahomeinsurance\">Keeping costs down for Florida home insurance</h2>\n<p>So the impact from reforms is likely a way off, and homeowners are still paying high home insurance premiums. That led many of the Redditors taking part in the AMA to ask how they can bring their costs down.</p>\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive, Sean said, but ”we love helping members mitigate their own risk.” Safer homes are a win for everyone because members end up paying lower premiums, and Kin pays less for the reinsurance we need to insure their homes.</p>\n<p>Some suggestions from the AMA to help lower premiums include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mitigating your wind risk.</strong> According to Sean, “a large part of the overall premium is driven by hurricane risk,” so Floridians need to harden their homes against hurricanes by securing their roofs and protecting their windows from flying debris. Not only does this safeguard your home and reduce your hurricane-wind premium, but it could make you eligible for {{< external-link url=\"https://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/OIR-B1-1699.xls\" text=\"windstorm loss reduction credits\" >}}.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacing older electrical panels.</strong> Certain brands of <a href=\"/blog/recalled-electrical-panels/\">recalled electrical panels</a> are more likely to catch fire. When our underwriters see this, we let the member know and tell them how to fix it.</li>\n<li><strong>Raising your deductible.</strong> Choosing a higher deductible usually means you have a lower premium. However, you’ll want to weigh what you might save against the reality of paying the higher deductible should you face a catastrophe.</li>\n<li><strong>Thinking about insurance when you shop for a home. “</strong>Homes that were built recently to modern code and are more inland haven’t been as adversely impacted by extreme weather as those closer to the water,” said Sean. He also encouraged homebuyers to identify their <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> and to budget for potential premium increases.</li>\n<li><strong>Asking about discounts.</strong> Like Sean said, safe homes are a win-win, so many insurance companies offer discounts for behavior that safeguards your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacing your roof.</strong> “Just like a lot of things, roofing material keeps getting better,” Sean said. Getting a new roof, installed by a good roofer, can save you money on insurance because most companies in Florida charge a lot more for older roofs.</li>\n<li><strong>Finding a policy with a</strong> <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\"><strong>roof schedule</strong></a> <strong>based on age.</strong> Your auto insurance doesn’t pay for a brand new car if you’re in a wreck. Similarly, Sean recommends getting home insurance that pays a specific percentage identified for your roof’s age. This can save you a lot of money, but it means your payout is lower if your roof is damaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should note that it wasn’t just Sean talking about how important the condition of your roof is to your insurance premiums. One Redditor backed him up by saying “The roof mitigation piece is huge. Our home was built with toe nails, but a quick <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">review of the proper connectors</a>, a hundred bucks at Home Depot, and a weekend crawling and hammering them up in the attic has saved me about $3,500 a year.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebottomline\">The bottom line</h2>\n<p>The Florida home insurance market is tricky, to say the least, but there is reason for hope. As Sean said, “There was a healthy insurance market in Florida in the past, and if the legislature continues to pass legislation to address the problems, there will be again.”</p>\n<p>But one thing we really hope our members take away from Sean’s AMA is that we are really motivated to solve the issues surrounding home insurance in Florida. Homeowners in the state deserve better, and we think we’re a company that can bring them the insurance experience they’re entitled to.</p>"
